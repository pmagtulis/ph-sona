President of the Philippines
To the Joint Session of the Congress of the Philippines

[Delivered on January 24, 1949]
“The Most Urgent Aim of the Administration”
Mr. PRESIDENT, Mr. SPEAKER, GENTLEMEN OF THE CONGRESS:
I am happy indeed to meet you in this historic hall. Its rehabilitation is the most recent evidence of our efforts at rapid reconstruction. We agreed to reconstruct the Legislative Building and the Finance and Agriculture buildings yonder only last September.
Today is our homecoming to this hall. It is my hope that before long the ruins and scars of battle in this hallowed area will disappear.
I have had the pleasant experience of working with you during your last legislative session. But I have not had as yet the formal occasion to thank you all for the splendid cooperation you have been giving me from the initial months of my administration. Without that cooperation I could not have carried on. I am in hopes that during the sessions just starting, we shall continue to work together with understanding and devotion, to the end that we may go ahead with the task of nation-building without unnecessary interruptions and distractions. This is an election year. We have barely ten months before most of us will have to account for our acts to the people. We have to present a work well done.
As you already know, I ascended the Presidency under the most depressing and distressing circumstances. But deep in my heart I was determined to carry on silently the work so auspiciously begun by my illustrious predecessor, our dear friend the late President Roxas, on our common venture to lay the foundations of this new Republic.
RESTORATION OF PEACE
My first concern was to complete the restoration of peace and order and to strengthen our people’s morale and confidence in the government. My first act in this direction was to order the reduction in the price of Class E rice, then selling at one peso, to eighty-five centavos a ganta. This order reduced the cost not only of other grades of rice but also of other essential commodities whose price structure is dependent on the cost of rice.
Then I made the first of my visits to the troubled areas in Central Luzon. Here the dissident elements were terrorizing the population with kidnappings and depredations. They were preying for food and other necessities upon the poor people of Pampanga, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija and Tarlac, the very people whose interests they were pretending to protect, whose welfare they were professing to promote. That tour elicited the offer of cooperation from the leader of the dissident elements. It resulted eventually, with your concurrence, in the issuance of an Amnesty Proclamation.
During the period of the Amnesty, the people of Central Luzon, .especially those seeking shelter in the poblaciones and those hiding in the hills, found it safe once more to return to their homes and resume the cultivation of their farms. No less than six thousand one hundred hectares in the troubled areas that had lain idle for four or five years were planted to rice. Upon the expiration of the proclamation period, the misguided elements resumed their defiance of the gov­ernment. They began again to harass the people dur­ing harvest time. But the government, through an effective Constabulary campaign, has been able not only to break their organization, driving the remnants to the deep recesses of the Sierra Madre, but to secure the biggest rice harvest since the outbreak of the war despite a drought and other natural calamities.
The Amnesty also served to unmask the dissidents. It exposed their communistic inspiration and direction. It uncovered their real purpose to overthrow the gov­ernment, which they had cloaked by agitation for so-­called social and agrarian reforms. Realizing this as they never had before, our law-abiding citizens gave·’ the government all their loyalty and support in the subsequent policy it followed of going after the dissi­dents with all its strength and power to uphold the law.
I am glad to report to you that the sporadic depre­dations of these outlaws in isolated areas of the country are but the last paroxysms of, a dying movement.
With the recent surrender of two hundred Moro out­laws in Jolo, the only threat of disorder in the traditional trouble area in the Sulu Archipelago during many regimes, has also disappeared.
The government shall continue its vigilance against potential disruptive elements which impair the efficiency of our productive efforts. We will not tolerate further interference with the steady prosecution of our social and economic program.
SOCIAL AMELIORATION
My second immediate objective was to provide for relief to the people in the troubled areas.
By executive order I created the Action Committee on Social Amelioration. I charged it with the duty to go to the field and minister to the needy, the hungry, the homeless and the sick, to victims of dissident, depredations and violence. I placed the four million pesos appropriated by Congress for peace and order and relief at the disposal of the Committee.
The Action Committee has carried out a program of social amelioration on a systematic and comprehensive scale. Some 700,000 needy people in thirteen provinces and chartered cities secured direct assistance food, clothing, medicine and, in some cases, direct cash loans. These loans amounted to P205,000 and were given to tenant-farmers in Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Rizal, Laguna and Quezon. In addition, the Committee distributed P330,000 worth of seeds, mainly palay, for distribution to farmers to augment the production of rice. Other food crops have likewise been planted. To provide employment to long unemployed people, the construction of public works projects in the troubled area was speeded up. In order to encourage the establishment of homes for the land­less, the acquisition of big landed estates to be parceled for resale to bonafide tenants at cost was also accelerated. Besides the purchase of thirty-five haciendas comprising 161.3 million square meters valued at 13.3 million pesos, we are acquiring additional estates in Arayat and Sta. Ana, Pampanga, and in Jalajala, Rizal, for the same purpose. These proposed new acquisitions involve an area of about 49.3 million square meters valued approximately at 1.2 million pesos.
The social amelioration program has been extended to other portions of the archipelago as far as Mindanao and Sulu, and has become a major policy of the Ad­ministration.
By the approval of Republic Act No. 304, we have solved the long standing demand among our thousands of government employees for backpay, under conditions which will do justice to the beneficiaries without unduly straining the finances of our government. By Acts Nos. 312 and 315, we have increased the minimum salaries of teachers, enlisted men and other small government employees. We have also elevated the status of the nurses in the Army by the creation under Act No. 203 of the Nurses Corps in the Medical Service.
Republic Act No. 312 provides for the standardization of teachers’ salaries on the basis of occupational assign­ments and educational qualifications. The 1948-1949 Appropriation Act had already been passed when this law was enacted. It will be my concern to make adequate provision in our next budget in order to carry out within our financial capacity the standardized rates provided for by this law.
We have further improved the lot of temporary gov­ernment employees and workers, including those in the corporations owned or controlled by the government, regardless of status, by giving them fifteen days vacation leave and fifteen days sick leave with full pay each year.
This past year additional relief accrued to our people from a substantial increase in employment. Wages increased two per cent, while the cost of living, based on the price index of essential commodities, dropped 39 per cent, a most gratifying development. Verily, the rising level of earning and the decreasing cost of living are converging upon a point of economic stability favorable to the great masses of our people.
We have obtained from the United States Govern­ment provision for the hospitalization of our veterans. Our government has extended to our heroes of the war and the resistance such benefits as we have been able initially to afford. At our invitation, a mission of the United States Veterans Administration will arrive in ­Manila next month to look further into the possibility of improving the assistance that has been given to Filipino veterans.
We have warded off epidemics. Large-scaIe immu­nization work has been accomplished. Medical care and facilities have been extended. Traveling clinics have been established. Hospitals and puericulture centers have been rehabilitated. We are taking steps to introduce on a big scale in our country the latest ad­vances in medical science including new drugs and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of leprosy and tuberculosis.
We have solved the heretofore recurrent school crisis. Nine thousand additional classes were opened throughout the country. We have made possible the admission of every child of school age seeking entrance to our public schools. For the first time in the history of civil administration in this country there was no such thing as a school crisis this school year.
To minimize delay in the adjudication of cases, we have expanded our judiciary by increasing the number of judges. We now have a full complement of the Judiciary, which has been completely reorganized under the Judiciary Act of 1948.
ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES
We have taken a new census of the country. After the long and destructive war, it was necessary to assess our resources for recovery and to plan for continued growth. The report shows our total population to be over 19 million as of October first, last. It indicates that have sufficient manpower to carry out our program national development.
The Administration is attaching particular importance to the adequacy of the coverage and the quality of the results produced by that census. We hope that it will give us a correct basis from which to draw a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the manpower resources of our country.
We must provide at the earliest practicable time facilities for efficient utilization of these resources. We need a more diversified occupational pattern, a reduction in the volume and duration of unemployment, an increase in the worker’s share in a bigger national output. We must insure those social welfare benefits so necessary to the attainment of full stature of a self-respecting citizen-education, recreation, security against illness and the infirmities of old age.
RECONSTRUCTION
During the last twelve months, we have rehabilitated 25,260 kilometers of roads, built 663 kilometers of new roads, constructed or rehabilitated 605 school houses, erected or rehabilitated 381 public buildings, con­structed or repaired 2,241 temporary and six permanent bridges, built or rehabilitated irrigation systems, at a total cost of 68.8 million pesos. This sum came from our general appropriations, from funds obtained from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, and from the Philippine War Damage Commission.
NATIONAL ECONOMY
We have balanced our national budget. We shall again have at the end of the current fiscal year a size­able surplus. But it is important that we continue with vigor our efforts to increase the revenue collections and to limit expenses to the most essential needs of the· public service.
We have greatly improved the economic and financial conditions of the country. Through the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, loans amounting to P90,480,136 have been granted for reconstruction and rehabilitation purposes. These loans have gone to farmers, tenants, industrialists, builders of homes and other elements assisting in the general economic uplift.
We have set up the Central Bank to expand our credit, stabilize our currency and provide a new source of financing for the agricultural and industrial develop­ment of the nation.
With the operation of the Central Bank, we expect to maintain our domestic monetary stability, the inter­national value of the peso, the free convertibility of ­the peso into United States dollars and other freely con­vertible currencies, and the promotion of a rising level of production, employment and real income. The greatest service of the Bank to the growth and prosperity of the national economy will lie in its use of its prerogatives under the law to create that financial en­vironment in which the growth of sound productive enterprises and the creation of a diversified pattern of production will be greatly encouraged. It is an obliga­tion of the Bank to promote and increase the rate of savings and channel them into productive investment outlets.
We have taken a long step forward in the financing of our industrial development. We have successfully concluded negotiations with the International Bank for. Reconstruction and Development for a loan covering our dollar needs in the construction of two of the four hydro-electric water power projects intended to spark our industrialization program. A definite commitment by the Bank in the sum of fifteen million dollars has been made. But hat amount will be adequate only for the Ambuklao and Lumot projects. Further negotiations will be conducted for the financing of the Itogon and the Maria Cristina projects, particularly the latter. The intensification of the agricultural and industrial development of Mindanao occupies a top priority in our program. The commitment thus far made is not only a favorable sign ushering in finally the implementation of our plans of economic development, but a significantly successful test of the solvency of our foreign credit, for it was accepted only after a thorough examination of our resources and development plans by a board of economists of international authority.
We have effected export control to retain for our own use articles and materials in short supply here, and import control to conserve our dollar resources so nec­essary for the expansion of our own productive enterprises.
If in the process greater participation by our own countrymen in the import trade is fostered, a greater gain will have been achieved. The import control order is not a finality. If it be found that supplies limited by the order will not adequately meet legitimate and justifiable demand the satisfaction of which will serve the national interest, increased quotas will be author­ized. But the fundamental objective of conserving the foreign exchange resources so that they may be available for economic development and of giving impetus to domestic production will loom large in the consideration of questions involving the relaxation of these controls. Our means and our remedies will be productive rather than speculative or merely restrictive.
We have yet to expand our foreign markets and cul­tivate and stabilize them with the continuous flow of exportable products in improved and standardized form.
OUR PRESTIGE ABROAD
With special pride I call your attention to the fact that today the Philippines has the friendship and respect of all nations. Our international relations have become stronger. Although the United States continues to be the only country that maintains an embassy here, eight other countries now have legations, and twenty-four nations in all have set up eight consulates general, fourteen consulates and four consular agencies. For our part, we have diplomatic establishments’ in eight nations and consular representatives in seventeen cities. We have recently established Philippine legations in London, Rome, Madrid, Nanking, Buenos Aires and a special mission in Tokyo. Our participations in inter­national conferences, especially in the United Nations and. its various agencies, and in interparliamentary unions and scientific and cultural conventions, have been conspicuous with constructive contributions to world understanding and peace.
The bi-partisan policy in foreign affairs which we adopted at the beginning of our international life as a Republic has resulted in effective representation abroad and virtually unanimous support at home. Our delegates have been honored with appointments to posi­tions of leadership in many international conferences in which we have participated. The nations have shown an increasing respect for the integrity and wis­dom of our counsel.
Our special relationship with the United States has been productive of goodwill invaluable to our growth as a young nation. We have shared in the rejoicing of the people of the United States in the re-election of President Truman and in the return of a Congress sym­pathetic to his liberal program. It. was President Truman who proclaimed the independence of the Phil­ippines barely two years ago. His continuance as the head of that great nation insures an abiding American concern over the future of our young Republic.
With the entire East threatened by the onrushing tide of Communism, the Philippines, the most strategic cross­roads linking the West and the East, remains the one safe, attractive home for free men in our part of the world, a haven for the masses of humanity fleeing from that flood.
MORALE IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE
I have reorganized the Cabinet. New members with proven ability, experience and integrity have been appointed. I have elevated the lady Commissioner of Social Welfare to Cabinet rank, giving to that position the importance commensurate with the new tasks assigned to it of carrying out the policy of the government on social amelioration. I have advanced in both the judicial and the executive departments, men of high standard of efficiency, thus giving encouragement to those in the lower ranks who have shown merit and loyalty to the service. I have opened opportunities for younger men to prepare themselves for high responsibilities in the public service. I am determined to pursue a line of action that will insure to our people honest and efficient service and will provide full enjoyment of the liberty and equal opportunity that we have dearly fought for and won, in peace and in war, at home and abroad.
We have laid the foundations of a stable, efficient, honored and dignified government. And we have brought it nearer to our people. We have been taking every opportunity to talk directly to them in their cities and towns, to observe their manner of living, to hear them discuss their needs, express their criticisms, their hopes, their aspirations.
We have strengthened further their confidence in our sincerity and integrity. We have demonstrated our willingness to invite and face public scrutiny. We have eliminated whatever evils have been uncovered. We have proved the primacy of public interest over party, group or personal claims. More than as the supreme head of the Liberal Party, in accordance with whose rules I am “the authorized spokesman of its decisions and policies,” as President of the Republic I declare this to be the unequivocal policy and determination of the Administration.
I cannot believe that God will not allow us to maintain this kind of government. We must consecrate ourselves and all our efforts to its attainment and dare while we pray, and pray while we dare.
TASKS AHEAD
Let me turn now to the immediate tasks before us.
PRODUCTION AND SOCIAL AMELIORATION
The most important and urgent aim of this administration at this stage is increased production and social amelioration. We cannot indefinitely ride on the foam of foreign charity and friendship. We must produce our own immediate necessities and raise, by the sweat of our brow, the lot of the men who toil on the farms and in the factories. We shall, where necessary, effect changes in the national economy to achieve this end. Our responsibility is no less urgent to those displaced and rendered homeless by public calamities.
Social security measures are under preparation by the Social Security Study Commission which I created for the purpose. The complexity and far-reaching consequences to our social life of such measures call for the closest study of their provisions. I urge you to approve adequate legislation providing for more health and housing facilities to banish our urban slums, to eliminate those fire hazards that are a daily menace to life and health, especially among the poorer sections of our towns and cities. We need more practical measures to implement our objective of giving our citizenry the maximum benefits to be derived from the development of our agricultural and industrial potentialities.
This is the age of the common man. This government has long stopped preaching. It now goes out to the field with an Action Committee and with a sizeable fund for its use in order to improve the lot of the com­mon man. The activities of the Committee are only in their initial stage. We want to follow up the program of social amelioration with greater intensity and give the masses a Straight Deal. This is my all-absorbing and consuming passion. We have to insure a standard of living in the farms, in the factories, in the homes that will be more in keeping and commensurate with our progress and advancement.
VETERANS AND GUERILLAS
The pensions to war widows, orphans and disabled veterans must continue with adequate funds therefore. The nation owes an eternal debt of gratitude to them. Their sacrifices shall not be in vain. I beseech the Congress to give the matter immediate consideration.
EMERGENCY CURRENCY AND GUERILLA NOTES
The redemption of emergency currency and guerrilla notes is a legal and moral obligation of this Government.
Our people are not concerned whether the funds for the purpose come from our Government or from the United States. The amount of 30 million pesos earmarked for the purpose and an additional ten million pesos made available by our government are insufficient to cover at par the full amount of P112,951,907 found by the Emergency Currency Board as having been duly issued .
It is necessary that we evolve a redemption scheme, an equitable solution. But a quick solution is imperative.
LABOR
There has been a notable readiness on the part of our laboring class to cooperate in the constructive activities of the country. The minimum wage for our laborers must be standardized and stabilized. I have urged the Labor-Management Advisory Board, in which capital and labor are equally represented, to submit a schedule it of wages applicable in the different industries and localities.
The Labor-Management Advisory Board is now studying the problem of wage standards in different regions. We must forestall wasteful periodic demands for revision of wages and the consequent uneconomic stoppages in our machinery of production. We need regulative rather than prohibitive measures against strikes. Both labor and capital must cooperate to achieve this end.
The salaries of employees in the lower brackets must also be improved. Private enterprises are offering better opportunities, and the Government is beginning to lose its most experienced personnel in the competition.
PUBLIC HEALTH
The outlook for tuberculosis control in our country by the use of the vaccine called “Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) is giving us high hopes; It is opening a new horizon to the work of reducing tuberculosis incidence to the minimum. Our authorities are keeping abreast of latest developments in medical research in other countries. We are a member of the World Health Organization through which the most recent medical discoveries and techniques are being made available to our people. While we should be discriminating in the adoption or application of remedies recently discovered, we should not lose time to utilize them to relieve our people once their efficacy is proven.
In the construction of roads I recommend that we provide sufficient funds to facilitate the building of cement or asphalt roads not only for reasons of economy but also for the health of our people. Our dusty roads are the causes of so many ailments afflicting them, especially tuberculosis.
In view of the lack of physicians in many of our com­munities, I recommend the immediate study and ap­proval of legislation providing for pre-paid medical service to our population which cannot afford medical assistance, especially those in remote rural communities.
EDUCATION
Our educational policy must be reviewed and revised for closer coordination with the objectives of our pro­posed development program, without sacrificing the tra­ditional aim of providing a liberal culture basic to the good life. I hope that the Joint Educational Committee of the Congress engaged in this study will be able to evolve a revision of the school system more adaptable to and in keeping with our national requirements.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
I urge total economic mobilization. Our economic structure should be built from below, making the foun­dation firm and accessible to the general population so that everyone can contribute to and share in the benefits of our material progress.
We must increase on the one hand our receipts from exports of improving quality, and decrease on the other the amounts of our import bills. The display and sale ­of Philippine-made goods must be given emphasis to balance the entrenched position of imported articles. We must not only produce more, but must educate our people to consume more home products. National protectionism in this regard is a legitimate ambition of every self-respecting independent nation.
The achievement of the first objective of increased production for export requires improvement of the cost conditions of our existing export industries, the develop­ment of new export products, the creation and cultiva­tion of new markets for our export trade.
We have heretofore overlooked or neglected our im­mediate neighbors in orienting our economic ties abroad.
Our search for new markets and the intensification of our promotional activities should consider the hitherto closed areas of Latin America, Europe and the Near East.
To achieve the second objective, we must give priority to the development of economic projects which can be brought up to the producing point within a relatively short time and will enable us to reduce the amount of dollars spent on imports.
Now is our opportunity to initiate the adjustment of our economy to maintain a stable, high level of em­ployment without unduly exposing our program to the’ dangers of unpredictable violent fluctuations of demand for basic export crops in the foreign markets.
I shall urge the members of the National Economic Council to give priority consideration to the Government’s short term development program. It should serve as the coordinating authority to knit together into a harmonious whole, bank credit policy, government, credit and fiscal policy, and developmental investment policy. The Council will be clothed with authority to approve and schedule projects, to allocate on a fair basis the funds or credit which the Central Bank may from time to time mobilize to the loan portfolios of government lending agencies, to keep them within the approved pattern of allocation of available capital and the limitations established by law. We will draw upon our full credit capacity, backed by the guaranty of the Na­tional Government, to secure funds for this program.
GOVERNMENT ENTERPRISES
There is need for coordination of the policies and operation of our government corporations to increase their usefulness to the national economy. It may be necessary to’ re-examine their structure and organiza­tion, their policies and their objectives, the scope and nature of their activities, and to gear all these to new goals set by a coherent development program. I recommend serious consideration of the advisability of creating a national central body or department that can more effectively direct, supervise and control the operations of government corporations. The coordination and consolidation of these corporations under one directing authority will place under unified direction assets worth over one billion pesos and corporate net worth valued at over 300 million pesos.
In our economic mobilization, we should give priority to our already established major industries. The abaca industry needs replanting and expansion. The tobacco industry must be revived and its foreign markets re­opened. The industrial processes developed for the coconut industry must be fully exploited. The pre­war sugar industry must be restored and markets for excess production over domestic demand and the United States import quota limitations must be found. I created the Sugar Rehabilitation and Readjustment Commission to advise the government on the proper measures to be adopted to revitalize and stabilize the sugar industry. In due time I will submit measures to realize these objectives.
It is necessary that we cast our eyes and exhaust our resourcefulness to secure the fuller utilization of our other natural resources and possibilities. We must speed up the digging of our mines, hasten the exploitation of our water power, and stimulate the search for new uses of our varied agricultural products heretofore not efficiently or commercially utilized.
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
The main problem of the country today is still to find ways and means of increasing production not only of palay and corn which constitute the basic cereal foods of the Filipino people, but also of other food crops, as well as meat, milk and other livestock prod­ucts, fish and other foodstuffs. More as a temporary solution of the worst rice crisis since liberation, I created the Rice Emergency Board which controls the procure­ment and distribution of locally-produced rice now and for the next two years. I fixed the price of this com­modity for the two-year period on an attractive basis for the direct benefit of the producers in order to encourage the production and steady supply of the cereal. Let us conduct a campaign for increased production, at least one more cavan of rice or corn per hectare of the’ thousands we are now cultivating. The plans are ad­vanced for the setting up of a fertilizer plant to encourage larger agricultural production. I recommend that more appropriations be set aside for the construction of new irrigation systems and the repair of those already in existence.
In the face of a persistent world shortage of rice” production, the Philippines cannot and should not be content to remain a rice importing nation. We are adopting measures to increase domestic production as rapidly as possible and help, incidentally, to conserve our foreign exchange resources. Independently of other recommendations of the Rice Emergency Commission, I have instructed the National Development Company to develop two 10,000-hectare areas for rice and peanut production: one in Cotabato and the other in Mindoro. Work in Cotabato is under way. Sixteen hundred hectares are now under cultivation. In fact we have a handsome initial harvest of 130,000 pesos worth of peanuts this season. This is but the beginning of the developmental work in agriculture planned in Mindanao. Similar preparatory work is being done in Mindoro. This program will be carried out in all parts of the country where large tracts of public land may be available for rice production until this unwholesome dependence upon outside supplies shall have been solved. It will insure abundance and conserve the 60 million pesos we remit abroad annually for our rice importation.
We must turn our concentrated attention to the development of Mindanao. Something must be done without loss of time to convert that vast region into a real empire of wealth. I recommend a general program of road construction to encourage production and communication. The establishment of the planned hydro-electric and fertilizer plant in Maria Cristina Falls will give the proper agricultural and industrial incen­tives. Locust pest is hampering the agricultural development of Northern Mindanao and even as far as Bohol and Cebu. I also recommend that sufficient appropriation be set aside to eradicate this winged enemy to our increased production.
We are having difficulties in the proper storage of rice, tobacco, copra and sugar. The construction of private or bonded warehouses for these products should be facilitated and encouraged.
Fishing is one of the most promising and flourishing industries of the country. But we are destroying this rich resource by the wanton use of dynamite in our sea and river fishing. This must be stopped. Let us put more teeth to the law on fishing.
Act No. 2932 on the exploitation of our oil deposits is now regarded as obsolete. We should give more facilities for the exploration and exploitation of our oil deposits. This is a promising industry. The world demand for oil is unlimited. I have sent abroad a special mission to study not only oil legislation but also methods and procedure of exploitation. I hope that our representatives will be helpful in the revision of our legislation on the subject.
RETAIL TRADE
We are still a long way from our goal of wresting control of our retail trade.
No government in the world can merely legislate any people or any nation into business superiority and prosperity. But both our government and our people can cooperate to attain this natural and legitimate aim; the government, by providing a coordinate scheme of incentives to tide new enterprises over initial difficulties; and the people, by adopting a more courageous outlook and using opportunities and privileges with religious attention to attendant obligations.
We shall continue the organization of PRATRA branches and agencies and of the consumers cooperative associations, as procurement and distributing agencies for their members, and encourage the organ­ization of provincial trading corporations to minimize profiteering.
PUBLIC FINANCE
We have progressed in our revenue collections but we are still far from our ultimate goals. Those goals will have been reached when our financial position will have so improved as to enable us to provide adequately for all public services.
We should have more effective legislation to en­courage honest tax-paying and curtail tax evasion. The national revenues can be increased not only by raising the taxes not restrictive to new industrial en­terprises but also by properly preventing tax evasion.
NATIONAL SECURITY
We are doing all in our power to train and organize our manpower resources for the national defense. But trained and courageous soldiers are not all that make an army. We must provide these men with the nec­essary equipment and supplies within the financial capacity of the government.
We need to expand our military training. What we have been able to provide thus far is not adequate to produce a citizen army that can be mobilized on short notice and strong enough for national defense. It would be more productive of better results and more economical to encourage military training throughout our schools, colleges and universities rather than maintain a big standing army.
FOREIGN RELATIONS
We will continue to adhere to the United Nations and we reaffirm our faith in its capacity to adjust in­ternational conflicts for the permanent peace of the world.
In the light of political developments in Southeast Asia, and the turbulent conditions in our immediate vicinity, the Philippines should further strengthen its position. Its leadership must be for constructive free­dom and peace and must insure the promotion and protection of the interests it shares in common with these states as well as its own.
We should adopt, for the security and stability of the Philippines, stricter safeguards against the entry or infiltration of subversive elements. Our home policy for peace and order must be strong. There must be national discipline. The government must be re­spected, its laws obeyed. We cannot expect outsiders to respect our government if we do not respect it ourselves. We now enjoy that respect at home and abroad.
FACING THE FUTURE
Looking thus at the record since the establishment of our Republic and forward beyond the horizons of our charted course, I am deeply encouraged. We can face the future confident in our capacity to bring abundance, security and peace to our people, through the tested constitutional processes of freedom and democracy which constitute our enduring allegiance and loyalty.
In spite of tremendous odds, our progress and the continually growing respect and friendship of other nations confirm our potentialities and active growth in stature. They sustain, our broadening role in world affairs, particularly those affecting the Eastern world, definitely directing us towards a strategic position of creative influence. We need continually to so build and discipline ourselves that we may attain and deserve the privilege of its ministry. Our opportunity to this end is to muster and organize all our resources, preserve our credit and prestige abroad and guard against their dissipation at home.
I call on every man and child of this nation to share in the privilege of the great tasks before us. I appeal for the utmost courage, wisdom, vision and dedication in taking up the challenge of our common objectives.
When I assumed office, my only pledge was what I recited in my oath. I meant every word of it. My policy has been simple. I have had only two main immediate objectives: the restoration of peace and order, and the strengthening of the morale of the people and their faith and confidence in the government.
I pledge to you, gentlemen of the Congress, my full cooperation in the greater tasks ahead, convinced that with Divine Guidance we will attain the goals we have set for ourselves to promote and safeguard — the wel­fare of our country and our contribution to the peace and happiness of the world.

Address
of
His Excellency Elpidio Quirino
President of the Philippines
On the State of the Nation
[Released on January 23, 1950]
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, and Gentlemen of the Congress:
Circumstances beyond my control make me forego the pleasure of appearing in person to deliver this message following a beautiful tradition established many years ago and adhered to most punctiliously by my predecessors in office. Although during your short period of special session coincident with my inauguration I had an opportunity to thank you informally for your prompt response on the measures that I recommended, I reiterate my deep appreciation for your fine spirit of cooperation from the start of this administration. I wish to assure you of the same cooperation in your legislative labors.
It give me great satisfaction to be able to report to you that, in spite of the unfavorable conditions under which we labored during the past year due to the intense and bitter political controversies which raged throughout the nation, we have achieved notable progress in our constructive endeavors.
There is relative peace and order in the entire country today. The sporadic activities of outlaws in isolated and widely dispersed localities are under control. There is no organized movement of any consequence that can be considered a threat to the stability of our Government. The recent attempt to challenge the authority of this Government by a few disgruntled elements has definitely ended with the surrender and offer of cooperation of these elements, and the amnesty granted by the Government. We can now say that, generally, our farms and our countryside are only awaiting the hand that would till the soil to contribute in proper measure to our productive efforts.
Our social amelioration program has shed its beneficent blessings on the people inhabiting even the remotest confines of the archipelago; it has given a relief to small independent farmers within and beyond the once called troubled areas. It has so spread the gospel of peace and so inspired the people with faith in their Government, that it is well nigh impossible for the subversive elements to indoctrinate them now with their pernicious theories and ideas.
We have continued to give accommodation to every child of school age in our public schools. At the opening of the present school year, some 4,500,000 pupils were enrolled, almost one quarter of out entire population. Besides, we have extended adult education to over 160,000 people and have maintained all over the country a goodly number of vocational schools, including trade schools, agricultural and rural schools, and farm settlement schools. The farm and animal products alone coming from these schools have reached in 1948 the value of over P36,000,000, in itself a substantial contribution to our national wealth.
Our health services have continued to expand with increasing efficiency. The general health condition all over the country has been excellent, and the death rate has materially diminished, while the birth rate has substantially increased. In my travels all over the country, I have seen the people and the children better dressed and looking more healthy. The rehabilitation of small homes has made rapid strides, and the Government has not slackened in its efforts to remove the slums still in evidence in the thickly populated centers. The price index of essential commodities reached a new low during the month of October 1949, raising the goods exchange value of the peso to 45:58 centavos, the highest since liberation.
While we have not as yet discovered a fully satisfactory formula for settling or preventing all industrial disputes, every effort is being exerted to minimize stoppage or dislocation of industries because of unnecessary strikes. To foster mutual understanding and minimize the causes of industrial conflicts, we are encouraging and assisting labor and management to enter into free and voluntary collective bargaining contracts. We settled during the past year 87 out 0f 187 labor cases submitted for conciliation, and 77 out of 83 labor conflicts involving strikes. With the creation of the Bureau of Industrial Safety, we hope to promote further the safety and welfare of the laboring class. Various pieces of legislation are under study, all of them designed to improved industrial relations and ultimately achieve industrial peace. I cannot overestimate the necessity of evolving some satisfactory solution to this problem, for only through it may we have our efforts in production continue to progress unhampered, attract capital to further investments, and increase opportunities for employment.
We have continued to give impetus to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of public buildings, especially the schools, and have materially increased out means of transportation and communication throughout the country. Besides, we have, during the last year, added 1,370 kilometers of new roads to our highway system, 34 concrete and steel permanent bridges, and have constructed, reconstructed, or repaired of total of 1,212 school buildings. We have also put in serviceable condition no less than twenty outlying ports besides the port of Manila; and, in order to aid out productive efforts, we have maintained and operated 14 irrigation systems, constructed and placed in operation three additional ones, and we have now in process of construction five major irrigation projects, all of them sufficient to furnish water to some 110,000 hectares of agricultural land.
As to our public finances, it is gratifying to note that although our tax collection system is still far from perfect, our internal revenue collections alone reached the sum of P320,076,759.88 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1949, an all time high for the country, as compared to P263,023,100.88 for the preceding year, In 1947, our national tax collection totaled only P191,000,000 and, in 1946, P67,000,000. Withal, we must not relax in our efforts. A drastic reorganization of out tax-collecting agencies is now under way.
We have expanded in our foreign relations, especially with the peoples of neighboring countries. We set up during the last year a legation in Bangkok, a consulate-general in Calcutta, and consulates in Karachi and Batavia. For Latin America, we established a legation in Buenos Aires, and accredited Ambassador Joaquin M. Elizalde as Minister to Cuba in addition to his duties as ambassador to the United States.
We concluded treaties of friendship with the Kingdom of Thailand and with the Republic of Turkey; cultural agreements with the Spanish State; and air service agreements with the Government of Pakistan and with the Kingdom of Greece.
Our contribution to world peace reached its peak when, with the election of Ambassador Carlos P. Romulo as President of the United Nations Assembly, the Philippines had the opportunity to preside over the deliberations of that world organization.
But in the rapid developments taking place in the Far East today, we should not be unmindful of our own national security—territorial, political and economic. At long last the eyes of the world are turned to this new area of portentous possibilities. We must find our just and constructive place inspired by and fortified with all prudence, foresight and firmness in the face of the changing scenes unfolding before our eyes. As the first Republic to be established in the Far East, our responsibility is great. Our mission is to broaden and expand our freedom and enrich our democratic institutions and secure for our people and our neighbors higher standards of creative living.
Internally, the most important problem facing us is the stabilization of our national economy.
In my annual message to the last Congress, I laid special emphasis on the urgent need for total economic mobilization. In line with this program, we have used all available means at our command in order to accelerate our development plans, rehabilitate our war-torn industries, and increase to the highest degree the production of export crops.
We have established priorities in the various projects that must be undertaken. The Central Bank which began to function at the beginning of 1949, implemented these plans with funds which it advanced to the national government under the provisions of section 137 of its charter.
Out of the total P200,000,000 of direct advances which the Central Bank is authorized to make, about P117,332,003 has been allocated by the National Economic Council, P52,126,450 of which has been released by the Central Bank for the past year mostly for the following projects: P7,925,000 for the rice and corn project of the National Development Company; P1,843,170 for the abaca rehabilitation project; P1,000,000 for power development projects; P11,000,000 for irrigation projects; and P20,000,000 for the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation.
In aid of the rehabilitation and reconstruction program, the Government has also disbursed from the general funds huge amounts which, in effect, constitute capital expenditures of the Government out of its ordinary revenues. For the reconstruction of 7,395 school buildings alone, the national government spent P53,306,172.74 from 1946 to 1949. For other permanent public works projects, the Government likewise disbursed, until May 31, 1949, a total of P123,451,687.16, over and above those made by the United States Government through the War Damage Commission and the United States Public Roads Administration. Other capital expenditures for which funds had been made available by the Government were as follows: P31,495,400 from 1946 to 1949 to various government corporations for rehabilitating and expanding their activities; P54,423,079 to the RFC as contribution to its capital; P9,999,179 for the purchase of preferred shares of banks to assist in their rehabilitation; and P3,600,000 to domestic insurance companies for the same purpose.
In addition to direct government financing as above indicated, our program of rehabilitation and development has been aided and continues to be aided through loans granted by the Philippine National Bank and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. Industrial loans granted by the Philippine National Bank from 1946 to June of 1949 amounted roughly to P108,800,000.
The Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, from its opening on January 2, 1947 to June 30, 1949, granted a total of 12,195 loans aggregating P228,626,374.
The impetus given by both direct government financing and financing by government lending agencies and private financing institutions in the Philippines to our program of economic mobilization has borne fruit. During the last three years, we have achieved definite progress in the rehabilitation of our major food and export industries.
The record shows:
Production of palay, which was only 36,893,940 cavans in 1945-1946, was around 56,000,000 cavans in 1948-1949, or slightly higher than the production in 1940. And 1949 is the second year in which we had no rice crisis.
Corn production is slightly higher than the pre-war production.
The production of fruits and nuts, beans and vegetables has improved over the pre-war record.
The fishing industry has not only recuperated rapidly since liberation, but has surpassed its pre-war output. In 1948, we produced 195,078 tons of fish, as against 170,000 in 1940, and the industry is now almost exclusively in Filipino hands.
Production of copra is in excess of pre-war. Oil production is below pre-war, but desiccated coconut output in 1948 exceeded the 1940 level.
The recovery of the sugar industry is one of the most encouraging signs in our post-war economic landscape. In 1945-1946, only four out of the 41 sugar mills in operation before the war were in operation. These four mills produced only 12,913.55 short tons. In 1947, production rose to 84,548.08 short tons and, in 1948, it went up to 398,113.10 short tons. During the milling season of 1948-1949, the industry produced a total of 719,324 short tons, and, for 1949-1950, estimates are that 800,000 short tons will be produced. There are now in operation 28 centrifugal sugar mills and two refineries.
Lumber is another industry which has recovered from the effects of war in a very striking manner. Of the 163 sawmills in operation before the war, 138 were destroyed, damaged or looted. Production of timber dropped from over one billion board feet in 1940 to 91,058,500 board feet in 1945-1946. It jumped in 1946-1947 to 438,784,500 board feet. Timber production for the year ending June 30, 1949 totaled again over a billion board feet. The production of sawn lumber has followed the phenomenal recovery in timber production.
With extraordinary effort and expense, we have no doubt attained a goodly part of our goals in the field of economic rehabilitation and development since independence in 1946; but much remains to be done to maintain our economy in a balanced state.
We have these past years since liberation seemingly enjoyed a life of plenty and even a luxury, not so much as a result of our productive energies as because of the temporary flow of money into our economy. Presently there is the large gap that has developed between the value of the products that we sell abroad and the cost of the products that we buy and bring into our country. We must realize that this state of affairs cannot continue without causing such disequilibrium in our economy as would eventually engulf us in the tremendous difficulties which other countries have experienced. It is because of this realization that we have taken immediate corrective measures to prevent a situation that would undermine the international stability and the internal value of our currency. This, we must maintain at all costs.
But we must not be unduly alarmed. We have taken such measures and we are taking other measures which, if carried out strictly and expeditiously, with the cooperation of one and all, should greatly improve our present economic situation. This country, with its vast resources, is as sound as any that there is on the face of the earth. I am confident that our people, trained as they have been, to undergo the extreme sacrifices that they have seen during the last war, will respond to the little inconveniences that the measures we are now taking might cause. These measures are none other than what any prudent man would take to correct a trend toward disaster if allowed unchecked.
But we are faced not only with the task of reducing import outlays and selecting which of our foreign purchases should be curtailed and which unrestricted in the interest of maintaining present standards of living. Ours is also the greater task of increasing our export receipts. This can be attained by carrying to full execution our rehabilitation and development as rapidly as possible. Projects that are promising of immediate results should be given preference over those that must of necessity, on account of their nature, take a long time to produce tangible returns.
Thus, our most serious concern for the next four years should be: immediate increased production through rapid rehabilitation and development; decreased public and external expenditures; Government reorganization to achieve efficiency, economy and effective rendition of public services responsive to the needs and welfare of our people; vigorous and honest enforcement of the tax laws; preservation of our national integrity and continued friendly relations with our neighbors and the entire world.
Let us exert every effort and employ every ounce of our energy to implement these high objectives. Let us pool the enthusiasm, the labors, and the patriotism of a united people and honestly pull together for the promotion of the common good to make secure, for all time, our national structure.

Message
of
His Excellency Elpidio Quirino
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Released on January 22, 1951]
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:
I join you today in opening your greatest opportunity yet to make history for our people. This is a year excep­tionally heavy with decision and destiny; and your actuations in this your second regular session may spell the difference between irreparable disaster and survival to our country.
I appreciate the earnest response of the Congress to the urgent call of action on the tax legislation program sub­mitted in the last two special sessions which I had called for the purpose. I am gratified by the thoroughness with which you have discussed the individual tax measures. I am happy that you have passed the military appropria­tion bill to provide means for immediate strengthening of our fighting units for internal security.
The solid action of both houses in approving a concurrent resolution expressing the policy of this Government to give preferential and serious consideration to the main recommen­dations of the U.S. Economic Survey Mission to accelerate social reform and economic development, and strengthen free and democratic institutions, is an earnest of our determinations to do our part to earn American assistance under the Economic Cooperation Administration.
It is understandable that all these measures cannot be approved in the twinkle of an eye; they involve our capac­ity not only to shoulder immediate additional tax burdens but also a long-range program of fiscal rehabilitation and financial stability. But the necessity to provide for our imperative needs in the present world crisis presses, as the untoward effects of their neglect mount daily in propor­tion and importance. Therefore, it is my sincere hope that special efforts will be exerted to carry out our program with­out much delay.
I refer especially to those measures designed to bolster our security from within and ward off danger from without. Of course, it will be next to impossible to provide for a com­plete program of national defense with our limited resources alone. We need a goodly measure of outside assistance from friends and allies, particularly the United States; and, to deserve that, we must show beyond cavil that we have the spirit and the will to help ourselves.
Our preparations for defense are not for our own sur­vival alone. We are no less participating directly in the implementation of a world issue, doing our proportionate share in the world effort to preserve peace and freedom for all. Our earnest efforts, therefore, to provide for our own security under the present circumstances become a vital part of our contribution to world security.
On the occasion of your three special sessions called after your last regular session I reported to you, and in my radio chats every fifteenth of the month, to the people, on the state of the nation. And as close and constant ob­servers of ·world developments, you bear witness to such a succession of events as to keep you well apprised not only of the state of the nation but of the ·world situation. It is, therefore, superfluous to repeat in this message, which I intended to be brief, all the problems that have been and are facing us, or to enumerate in detail the unfinished work requiring our common action. I shall, therefore, mention only the outstanding and most pressing ones.
PUBLIC HEALTH
I shall begin with the health of our citizenry. The state of health of the nation is satisfactory, but there is much room for improvement. . Many of our people do not drink clean water and it is extremely costly to construct water systems during these days of financial stringency. There should be more artesian wells in cities and municipalities, especially in the barrios.
The country needs more hospitals and clinics.
Greater impetus should be given to the campaign against malaria, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. We should produce more vaccines and sera and other biological products and antibiotics.
SOCIAL WELFARE
The merging of the Social Welfare Commission and the PACSA into the Social Welfare Administration has been conceived in order to coordinate and concentrate our atten­tion and better promote the welfare of the less privileged class of our population. With the reorganization thus ef­fected, I am sure we will further improve the social welfare services.
More social reforms are due to enable the landless to own their lands, earn their livelihood, and enjoy a higher stand­ard of living. It is never enough to promise social justice. Our most effective answer to Communism is a genuine strengthening of our national social program for the definite and positive improvement of the people’s welfare.
Our immediate need is to provide adequate wherewithal to carry out our social amelioration program. The reduc­tion of our appropriation for this purpose last year has greatly handicapped our relief and assistance to the needy.
LABOR
I trust that you will act upon the pending minimum wage bill. We want no regions or industries in the Philippines to fatten on underpaid labor.
The Conventions and Recommendations under the Inter­national Labor Organization to which the Philippines is a party should be ratified. They deal with the means of pro­tecting our workers and promoting industrial harmony. They embody the most notable experiences of practically all the countries of the world, and provide us with a highly dependable guide for constructive social and labor legislation. Both the Workmen’s Compensation Act and the Woman and Child Labor Law, and other laws, parts of which have be­come obsolete, must also be revised to make them more responsive to the present needs of our people.
PUBLIC EDUCATION
Despite limited finances, we have been able to accom­modate all the children seeking admission in the public schools. But mere admission is not enough. We must pro­vide a type of education adequate to produce constructive, honest, efficient, disciplined, and loyal citizens.
In the reorganization of the Department of Education, I emphasized the necessity of giving more impetus to vocational training. It is my hope that by a proper revision of our educational laws, coupled with adequate funds and adjustment in the curriculum, our millions of students in our public schools alone could be made to produce many of the things that we need today and not wait for the full develop­ment of their potentiality.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
We have revitalized the judiciary by appointing men of proven ability and integrity, and by imposing a more ex­peditious disposition of court cases. In the face of threats posed by unscrupulous elements, our courts have acted positively and courageously in cases prejudicial to the general welfare and security. But we need more judges of first instance to cope with the increasing work. We need also more severe measures to implement our deter­mination to have the laws safeguarding the life and health of our citizenry enforced.
PUBLIC WORKS AND COMMUNICATIONS
With the help of the U.S. Government under the Rehabilitation Act and with our own appropriations, a total of 1,012.7 kilometers of new roads was added last year to our highway system. Four new bridges were constructed and 321 bridges reconstructed. Six new irri­gation systems with a total of 23,000 hectares to be served were built. Under construction are seven major irrigation projects covering a total area of 20,200 hectares. We have maintained 14 irrigation systems already serving 83,600 hectares.
It is necessary, however, that we provide for more urgent projects such as irrigation, waterworks, artesian wells, roads, and bridges. The construction of a network of roads in Mindanao must be accelerated in order to give impetus to the agricultural and industrial development of this fertile region. Funds should be made available for the estab­lishment there of a more extensive and efficient telecom­munication system.
AGRICULTURE
In spite of our efforts to rehabilitate our badly damaged agriculture, we still have plenty to do in order to attain our goal. The production of copra, lumber, and others has been brought to prewar level, but our output of sugar, abaca, tobacco, and gold among others has remained below that of 1941. We should accelerate and increase produc­tion. We must make our country self-sufficient in food and other essentials. We should produce not only what we actually need but what we shall need in the impending greater emergency. We should set aside more funds to hasten the subdivision of public lands and to expedite the necessary surveys needed for the issuance of titles.
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY
The application of trade controls to meet the existing emergency has resulted in the recessive trend of trade in the country. However, we have been able to improve the posi­tion of our foreign trade. Our unfavorable trade balance during the 11 months of 1950 amounted to over P28.8 million only as against P547.1 million for the same period in 1949.
Present precarious conditions demand the continuance for the time being of economic control measures and their im­provement. At the same time appropriate measures should be taken to control exports and prevent the exportation of essential commodities and critical materials needed for con­struction and national defense.
Measures have been taken to stockpile essential commod­ities, to lessen the curtailment of imports of equipment and materials for agriculture and industry, and to allow the unlimited import of foodstuffs. The control of prices must be made more effective everywhere. To this end, certain amendments to the Price Control Law are necessary.
Owing to the control of imports, 60 cigarette factories and seven nail factories, among others, have been established. To prevent overcrowding of new industries, a system of licensing of new industries should be adopted.
GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION
I am submitting today the final executive acts to complete the reorganization of the Executive Department, under the authority granted by the Congress in Act No. 422. I take this occasion to express my appreciation for the con­scientious work undertaken by the Reorganization Commis­sion, headed by Minister Ramon Fernandez, which greatly helped me in this major work of government reorganization.
While few radical changes have been made due to the present political development of the country and the social and economic repercussions that a drastic reorganization en­tails, it must be stated that the prime objectives of efficiency, simplicity, and economy have weighed heavily in the de­termination of the changes effected.
In the Executive Department alone, we have been able to effect economies estimated at P5,000,000 in the present budget. A major portion of the savings, however, will be utilized to pay the gratuities of officers and employees whose positions have been abolished. But the yearly saving of P5,000,000 hereafter is awaited.
In the reorganization of government-owned and controlled corporations, it is estimated that a savings of P7,000,000 will also be effected. The discontinuation of enterprises which have been incurring substantial recurrent losses in the past years and the recasting and coordination of the activities for greater efficiency and economy of the corporations that re­main, will likewise add to the estimated saving of P7,000,000 by the reorganization of the other entities.
All in all, therefore, an estimated yearly saving of P12,000,000 has been effected due to the reorganization. But this is not the limit. It is my hope that, with a more detailed study of the changes which have been started, the Congress may yet make judicious changes in several branches of the government in order to reduce the overhead expenses of administration.
With combined assets estimated at over P1.2 billion, the government-owned and controlled enterprises, have been reduced from 23 to 13, but will continue to exert decisive influence in various parts of the Philippine economy. It is gratifying to note the readiness with which private leaders of industry have responded, making themselves available in the cooperative work of coordinating public and private enterprises.
But the present government agencies assigned to im­plement the economic rehabilitation and development prog­ram are not structurally patterned to meet emergency situa­tions. They do not possess adequate power and authority in themselves, separately, to cope with the new situation. Thus, I have appointed an Economic Mobilization Committee composed of members of the Cabinet and of the Congress and economic leaders outside the government to study the advisability of centralized direction and control over the economic forces of the country that should be concentrated and coordinated to assure that changing conditions may be met promptly and effectively.
NATIONAL ECONOMY
Philippine economy made great strides last year. Through the efforts of the government and our people, the nation’s economy is again on the upgrade. Much still remains to be done. Our development program must be pushed through with vigor.
Last year the Philippines achieved a favorable balance in international payments of $85.4 million as against a deficit of $161 million in 1949. However, dollar receipts in 1951 are expected to be much less due to the termination of U. S. war damage payments.
I am gratified to observe the determination of the Congress to follow up our commitments for the implementation of our understanding with the United States leading to financial assistance under the ECA. But I must state that our tax program is not predicated merely on our desire to do our part in furtherance of said commitments. We have to provide for our most critical and urgent necessities. In fact, if we have to adequately meet our imperative needs, we must have an income more than the goal of P565 million envisaged in that understanding. But I know the capacity of our people. I would not be a party to bleeding them to inanition. Nevertheless, we must all make a sacrifice, not merely to meet ECA requirements but to insure our own good and safety. With the approval of our pending tax program, both can be substantially accomplished.
I realize that the tax bills are not popular, for taxes are seldom popular, if at all. They are, however, of absolute necessity now. There is no longer any other source for needed public funds. The borrowing capacity of our Gov­ernment is limited. We cannot justifiably look always to the United States to meet our budgetary requirements. This Government cannot be delivered to the Treasury of the United States. We need additional revenues to carry out more effectively our peace and order drive, to educate our children, to protect our people against epidemics, to provide for our national defense, and even for the normal functions of government alone. And certainly, we need additional revenues to finance and accelerate the implemen­tation of our economic development program in order to promote a rising level of production and employment. We must convince our people not to begrudge the just share of each for the ultimate benefit and protection of all. After all, the tax program before you places the burden on those who are able to pay and aims to correct inequalities under the present tax system.
NATIONAL DEFENSE
Some eight months ago, the majority of our people believed that the solution of our peace and order problem could be achieved primarily by the adoption of measures other than military. Even today there are some who delude themselves into believing that our peace and order problem is predominantly a social one. Social and economic measures will doubtless contribute immeasurably to the solution of this vital problem. For that reason, I have put into operation various non-military agencies to look after the welfare of the masses in various areas.
Present conditions, however, compel us to meet this problem with military force. We cannot risk losing by sheer default the priceless heritage of freedom we still enjoy.
I am pleased to note that the people and the Congress have given unqualified support for the increase in strength of the Armed Forces by ten battalion combat teams.
In behalf of our fighting men, I urge approval of the bill now before you, granting gratuity and other benefits to officers and men of the Armed Forces who become casualties in the present anti-dissident campaign. Only by doing so can we hope to do justice to our gallant men who are engaged in the heroic task of restoring peace and order in this country in the shortest possible time.
Equally urgent is our task of making available to the Armed Forces the necessary funds to make possible the retirement of officers and men who have served the country so faithfully and well and thus accelerate their replacement with younger and deserving elements.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
The new year presages events of extremely serious con­sequences, particularly to the countries in the Far East. Almost two years ago I presented to the American people, through the U. S. Senate, their highest foreign policy­making body, to the problem of security of the free coun­tries of Asia. I said then, and I say it now, that “I consider it my supreme responsibility in this perilous hour to call upon our friends everywhere, but especially our friends in America, not to tarry too long in the redefinition of fundamental attitudes towards Asia,” in the face of growing Communist menace and aggression, for the issue involves “the fate of more than half of mankind in the next thousand years.” I decried the lack of “calm, de­liberate movement towards clarity, vigor, and resolution.” I observed then that the reaction was suppressed or cautious concern. And I posed, “Only the blind will say that the menace does not concern America, because the history of the last two world wars shows all too clearly that this great democracy cannot remain unconcerned wherever and whenever the survival of free men in a free world is at stake.”
America’s immediate action last June in the· defense of the freedom of South Korea justified my prediction. And we are now fighting side by side with her· and the forces of the United Nations, in the plains and mountain fast­nesses and ravines in Korea, in our determined adherence to the principles of peace, liberty, and justice against the forces of aggression.
Owing to the mounting tension and uncertainty, we have therefore urged for a thorough and expeditious implemen­tation of our military assistance pact with the United States. And we have received assurances from the Amer­ican Government that the United States will help us defend our national integrity and independence.
But we cannot depend entirely on foreign assistance to maintain our integrity. National honor and dignity re­quire that we do not accept the role of a mere ward in the defense of our own liberty and freedom. Thus, we are making the utmost sacrifice to meet our internal and external obligations to enable us to contribute our just share to world security. For we can only hope that world statesmanship will eventually find a peaceful and honorable solution to the pressing problems that threaten the freedom and security of mankind.
Gentlemen of the Congress, I have come not merely to urge action, but to offer cooperation. We must pull to­gether and assume solidarity of responsibility in the execution of a program for our country’s preservation. I have come to ask that we all concentrate our united efforts to insure our stability as a nation and preserve our liberty as a people. This is our sworn solemn duty, and we can .do no better than share cheerfully and decisively in the discharge of that great responsibility.
These are unusual times indeed. We are called upon to do our utmost in a situation in which we have never been placed before. We have to summon all our courage and intelligence and coordinate and contribute all the strength we can muster, in material and moral resources. We can­not afford to fail in meeting the present problem of sur­vival.
Arms without valor, however powerful, are useless weapons. Valor can be aroused only by a righteous cause. This we have, and we are pledged to fight for it and if need be to die for it. We are doing that right now even beyond our borders. We are increasing our forces for this cause-the cause of innocent free men, women, and children in our midst and everywhere, ravished and destroyed by the agents of a foreign foe bent on world domination.
But we know that armed forces are not enough. We need even more critically, on the part of all of us, a moral rearmament. Our greatest enemy can be ourselves when we stubbornly resist to purge what is selfish in us. The world is not merely on the verge of fire; it is on fire. And yet people can be immobilized by fiddling and tem­po razing while the nation’s very life and future are at stake. Let us, as leaders of this nation, give the appro­priate example in moral rearmament. Let us, to the limit of our spiritual resources, will to fight the formidable enemy, whose lust for world power has impressed many of our people, to the extent of falling for his familiar tricks of fostering dissension and subversive ambition.
At this most critical moment, our attitude has become a matter of individual and collective conscience. I call upon you to stand as one man, morally and spiritually rearmed to rise and protect our country and people from the blight of inaction and fratricidal strife in a period of the greatest peril.

MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER,
MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:
I welcome you once again as you begin this third session of the Second Congress. I welcome, especially, the dis­tinguished new members of the Senate. Our people have willed that the ranks of the opposition be bolstered. The fiscalizing mission of the minority will thus have greater opportunity of accomplishment. It is my hope that in such a task it will be as fruitfully effective as it should be patriot­ically cooperative, ever mindful of our joint responsibility to keep this nation always unified. The institutions which we have built and the Republic which we have erected belong to us, one and all, for us to honor and protect.
The age in which we live and the international associa­tion with which we chose to be identified make us conscious in every phase of our lives that we have a country to de­fend, to develop for our people’s welfare, and to strengthen as a bastion for internal peace and for the peace of the world.
The facts of history require us to consider under the present world set-up that, while there are still leading nations, no longer are there big and small nations apart from one another. We are divided into groups, practi­cally into two major groups—one believing in a world order under the theory of enslavement by a dominating power, the other under the theory of co-existence based upon the collective authority of free democratic govern­ments. The former fosters chaos and confusion to gain adherents, the latter develops the spirit of self-help to strengthen each unit as a composite integral part of a world organization dedicated to universal peace.
You and I, regardless of party alignments, have but one purpose: to seek the welfare and happiness of our people. In serving them, often we have had different points of view. We shall perhaps differ time and again in approach and in procedure, but never in fundamentals. Differences are sal­utary when born out of individual freedom—of thought and action, and restrained by unity of purpose—love and soli­darity of our fellow countrymen. Provided we always keep in mind, as we did in the last sessions of the Congress, that all we, each of us, are trying to do, is to contribute our utmost in promoting the safety and well-being of our people, democracy will flourish as a vital dominating force in our national life.
We showed this in our last popular experiment. Whatever the consequences to us politically, we secured the free and untrammelled expression of the people’s will, for only on the rock of democracy can we build a free Philippines.
To build it required centuries of sacrifice in blood and treasure. Layer by layer, stone on stone, on the bones and ashes of those who preceded us, each generation in its epoch and in its regime left the sediment of its labor and influence to give us the country that is ours today. Thus, whatever we have at this hour, everything that we enjoy, did not come about full-grown overnight, is not solely the work of today. It is the result of a continuing process, as each, in his time, contributes his genius and vision as well as his sweat and sinew to leave to those who follow a country better than he found it, winning for it with each passing year a growing measure of admiration and respect.
And as we look back and realize the vicissitudes and mis­fortunes that have been our people’s lot in the recent past, devastated and torn to pieces as we were, it should give us renewed courage that not only did we survive, but that we survived with dignity and honor.
Today, this our epoch is one of economic and political survival, of internal and external security. How did we reach it? I shall now report on how we have been con­tributing our modest share in the last three or four years and dwell on the important phases of our national life and the processes which led us to the status we now enjoy.
BACKGROUND
But before doing so, allow me to review in brief retrospect our struggle for survival. You will recall that when we reconstituted the Commonwealth Government in 1945, we had an economy left prostrate by the war. We did not have the revenues needed to finance the normal functions of government. We had to seek relief and assistance from the United States to supplement the meager P36,000,000 available in the General Fund. Relief and assistance were granted us in various forms: in foodstuffs, clothing, other relief goods of all kinds, surplus equipment and supplies of the United States forces in the Philippines, and cash in the form of war damage payments, pensions, gratuities, and grants and loans.
Our people, denied of even the essentials during the Japanese occupation, reacted to this sudden flow of help by spending much too freely for their own good. At the same time, loose firearms in the hands of people who helped us in our liberation abound everywhere; still trigger-happy, many individuals organized themselves into bands, enjoying as well as endangering life in the outlying districts, and even in our midst, at the point of the gun. This fact as well as the moral trauma resultant of the war and vestigial inequalities rooted in centuries of servitude unfortunately led unscrupulous and misguided people to graft and corrup­tion, to disorder, and gradually to dissidence.
Thus, when we entered upon the first phase of this administration, which was merely a continuation of the Roxas regime cut short by the demise in 1948 of our dear friend, President Roxas, we were faced with two great problems: the maintenance of peace and order and the strengthening of the confidence of the people in their gov­ernment—both of which occupied my mind upon my assump­tion of office. This brief but painful interlude in our political odyssey aroused fear and distrust both here and abroad. Our first step was to purge the government of dishonest officials. We ordered the investigation of the Philippine Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (PRRA) and later the Surplus Property Commission, which were the foci of infection. The investigation of the first brought forth negligible results, but the investigation of the second resulted in the dismissal, prosecution, and conviction of many of its personnel. The investigation was extended to other branches of the government and, similarly, other dismissals, prosecutions, and convictions were the result.
Simultaneously, we directed our attention to the suppression of banditry and dissidence, offering to the latter amnesty which shortly thereafter—not through the fault of the government—was repudiated. But we were not discouraged and continued unabated our moral crusade and campaign for peace and order. These problems became more complicated as internal discontent, disturbance, and insecurity increased. As if these were not enough, the clamor for back pay and the murmurings of rice crisis and recurrent school crisis harassed us. On top of these came the grave problems affecting our external security. We were poor, deep in debt, assailed and embarrassed in our struggle for stability. And we were drawn into a struggle not only for our national survival, but also for that of democracy in a world rent by an ideological warfare that had congealed into a cold war.
INTERNAL SECURITY
We had to reorganize and strengthen our armed forces to cope with the increasingly grave situation. We intensified our peace and order campaign, adopting new methods of dealing with the local foe as we prepared to face him in Korea.
The large gains made in the campaign this past year are now of public knowledge, and given due recognition here and abroad. We still have elements inspired from abroad plotting unlawful seizure of governmental power, constantly seeking “to undermine the land of their birth in the interest of the land of their ideology.” They were in a fair way to accomplishing their nefarious plans but for the systematic and determined action by the defense forces of the Republic which not only nullified and frustrated, but also dispersed these covert elements and disrupted their time-table. With excellent intelligence work we were able to round up the ­members of their politburo and secured their prosecution and conviction. There are now more surrenderees than captives or Huk casualties; many of them are settled in government farms with their families, awaiting the routine process to make their present landholdings their own. By a more intensive follow-up in our campaign and more extensive realization of our program of constructive attraction, we hope to achieve the permanent eradication of the threat that the subverters posed.
I must apprise you of the fact that the operations to re­store peace have not been without their cost. The casualty total is roughly 900, with 350 killed and 550 wounded. There are approximately 1,500 men in our army hospitals. For those who unselfishly and heroically gave their lives, for their widows and orphans, I bespeak your heartfelt support and assistance.
I wish, in solemn gratification, to stress the record of cour­age and heroism of our troops in Korea. They have covered themselves with glory and made every Filipino proud. Through their sacrifices we are giving our stint in the epic fight for freedom and peace.
ECONOMIC RECOVERY
Our country saw during the past year a remarkable improvement in its general economic condition. A co­ordinated set of remedial measures in the monetary, fiscal, and production fields, together with improvements in administrative organization, and in the peace and order condition, dispelled almost overnight the despondency and irrational apprehension that seemed to have caught hold of business and or productive segments of the agricultural population. General confidence increased and with it came a new resolve on the part of our people to make this land a haven of peace and prosperity for the coming generations.
Stimulated by favorable international prices after the outbreak of the Korean War, the production of our ex­port industries expanded. This favorable turn of events together with the strict conservation measures adopted during 1950 enabled us to raise substantially the level of our international reserve and to introduce a series of measures, which had the immediate welcome effect of temporarily liberalizing the control over imports.
The psychological effect of these measures as well as the substantial amounts or goods that came during 1951 were two of the main influences that pulled down prices to levels more consistent with the income earned by the great mass of our people.
Contributing in no small degree to the restoration of stability in internal prices were the measures taken to­wards the end of 1950 and during 1951 to increase the revenue of the government. All these efforts were com­plemented by a restrictive credit policy on the part of banking institutions which brought about a further reduction in the money supply.
As a result of these measures, the cost of living which rose from June 1950 for a year has dropped substantially since. Meanwhile, production improved greatly not only in the export industries but in other fields, especially mining and manufacturing. The index on the physical volume of production has risen from 97.5 in 1950 to 107.1 in 1951, with 1937 as a base. There is more manufacturing activity going on now than ever before in the history of this coun­try. National income for 1951 was P5,120,000,000 as against P4,608,000,000 in 1950. This rapid increase in pro­ductive activity reflects considerable new investment, both foreign and domestic, in plants and equipment which would not have been made had there been no restoration of con­fidence in the future progress and stability of this country. Inquiries from parties’ abroad contemplating investment of capital in the Philippines have been on the increase, and our economic recovery has been the subject of favorable comments on the part of many competent observers abroad.
Several of the basic development projects that the gov­ernment has financed are in advanced stages of construction. The power projects, such as the Lumot Diversion Project, already completed, the Maria Cristina Hydroelectric Power and Fertilizer plants both to be completed at the end of this year, and the Ambuklao Hydroelectric Power Projects, now also under construction, will give a tremen­dous boost not only to industrial development but also to a more diversified rural economy. The funds provided for the construction of irrigation projects and the purchase of fertilizers give further assurance of our steady march to­ward the attainment of self-sufficiency in food crops, espe­cially rice. The construction of additional textile mills such as the one now in operation in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur, represents the beginning of an effort on our part to reduce this country’s dependence on outside sources for one of the elemental necessities of life.
The immediate result of the economic measures we have adopted during the past year and a half is to preserve for our people the real value of their worldly possessions. The inflation in prices has been not only arrested but rolled back, thus restoring especially to the lower income brackets the real goods and services that they could claim with their money income. The operation of the minimum wage and tax laws implemented last year brought about a wider and more equitable distribution of the money income in the economy as a whole. Together with the reduction in price levels, these measures could be expected to bring about a permanent improvement in the welfare of our people.
Our international economic relations and prestige have also improved as a result of the change for the better in our domestic situation. The regard in which the Philip­pine peso is held in international markets today is so much higher than a year ago. No longer is its value doubted. It is regarded as one of the most stable in the world. Thus, our ability as an independent and sovereign people to manage our own economic affairs is no longer underrated.
GOVERNMENT FINANCES
Our record in the field or fiscal policy in the past year is worth underscoring. It is well known that government finances have been severely strained during these postwar years due to the mounting expenditures for defense and peace and order, for public instruction to keep abreast of the increasing school population, for the reconstruction of war-damaged facilities, for the rehabilitation of government corporations, and for reactivating services paralyzed during the last war. The time since liberation has been too short for the country to recover from the ravages of the war. Consequently the national economy could not yield sufficient revenue from taxes or other sources to meet not only current irreducible expenditures but also extraordinary expenditures for economic rehabilitation and development and for various urgent social services.
The seriousness of the situation at the end of 1950 was such that in my Message to the Congress on January 22, 1951, I said that 1951 was a year exceptionally heavy with decision and destiny; that your actuations during your sec­ond regular session might spell the difference between irre­parable disaster and survival to our country.
It reflects creditably on the patriotism of the members of the Congress that you proved equal to the situation. Under the most adverse conditions, you approved revenue measures that enabled the country to cope with the emer­gency. Never before have our revenues been as high as they are in the current fiscal year. I shall deal on this subject in greater detail in my budget message.
For the time being, I am particularly happy to report that during this period we were able to complete the final payment on all pre-1934 dollar-bonded indebtedness in the United States, We are on the way to liquidating the ad­vances from the fiduciary and special funds. For some time now we have not borrowed from the banks for bud­getary purposes. We have resumed paying some of our sinking fund obligations including the first installment on the loan secured from the United States Treasury. And we have been able successfully to convert, after paying an amortization and interest of P7.1 million, our $60 million loan with the United States Reconstruction Finance Cor­poration from a two-year into a ten-year loan payable in equal twenty semi-annual installments starting January, 1952.
ECA AID
With this improvement in our financial climate, the gov­ernment of the United States began the implementation in this country of the program of economic assistance promised in the Quirino-Foster Agreement. ECA aid began flowing into our economy in the form of fertilizers, irrigation pumps, grants for the rehabilitation of agricultural colleges and the establishment of experimental stations and extension serv­ices, eradication of plant diseases, land survey and road building programs in Mindanao and other areas, public health promotion, survey of basic mineral resources, and promotion of cottage industries. It is our hope that in the coming months, this flow of assistance will continue to increase in volume, for there is no doubt that it will accelerate our progress towards a higher level of production.
But while we are perhaps entitled to take pride in these substantial achievements, we cannot relax in our efforts to put this country on a truly stable economic basis. There is much still that remains to be done. The discipline that we have had to impose on ourselves over the past years cannot as yet be relaxed. The last two years have given us some time to acquire valuable administrative experience in the operation of economic controls. The maintenance of these controls is still necessary for the public welfare. They can only be removed after the necessary adjustments have been made in our international economic relations. It is vital that we review our trade agreement with the United States, in order that it may be placed on a more equitable basis, in keeping with present-day circumstances in both countries. A readjustment is essential to our achievement of a more stable and balanced economy.
While it is true that we have attained a measure of finan­cial stability in the domestic as well as in the international field, it is still necessary for us to continue exercising dis­cretion and vigilance in the expenditures not only of public but also of private resources. We must at times re­member that our financial resources are limited and that the greatest care is needed to insure their use in the most efficient manner possible. Having committed ourselves to a policy of economic development as the only solution to the problem of poverty and under-production, we must mobilize all our resources and exercise the greatest care in their investment. While the assistance of our friend and ally, the United States, would materially accelerate this process, only our own resources can support it on a permanent basis. Fundamentally, the spirit behind the ECA aid is develop­ment through self-help. Only by showing this spirit can we expect more substantial help than what we have heretofore received. ECA is not manna or a substitute for dole, much less a premium to complacency.
And while we were able to bring down prices substan­tially, our vigil over inflation is far from over. We are fortunate that while the great nations of the world are engulfed in an inflationary wave under the impact of huge military programs, we here in the Philippines have controlled it and have prevented its running away with our earthly possessions. We must keep it controlled by limiting our ex­penditures to truly essential purposes and well within the revenues which we are capable of producing.
LABOR, RELIEF, AND SOCIAL SECURITY
We have established a group of governmental activities which deal with the satisfaction of the basic needs of our citizenry. Our people ask for little after their need for security-the security of their person, their property, and their freedom,-has been vouchsafed to them. But our government as any other present-day government has gone further. We have endeavored to assist the citizen in his efforts to build up a small competence for himself and his dependents. We have therefore emphasized the administra­tion of the public resources in a manner to provide work and earning opportunities for the citizen to secure him food, shelter, and clothing, as well as, if possible, a modicum of sustenance and comfort in sickness and old age.
We have constantly been improving the pay of those who occupy the common ranks of both public and private employment. This past year we passed the minimum wage law. But it will perhaps be necessary to revise this legisla­tion as well, as the Workmen’s Compensation Act and the 8-hour labor law to make them easier of enforcement and more compatible with present conditions and exigencies. The same thing should be done with the Rice Tenancy Law so as to clarify existing doubts regarding the application of the 70-30 sharing in the harvest. We shall continue the furtherance of the protection being accorded the individual laboring man. For his health and security, as well as for the protection of his rights, a vigorous campaign for the enforcement of the laws enacted for his benefit, which are also for the preservation of his employer, is being waged and shall continue unabatedly.
The welfare of our workers who have seen fit to search for well-being abroad will likewise be our continuing concern.
As important in our agenda on behalf of labor, is that which deals with land distribution and settlement. This last year, 1,686 settlers, not counting their dependents, have been accommodated in land reservations in Cotabato, Bukidnon, Lanao, and Isabela. Our settlement projects today have a total population of 115,000. These do not include families from Luzon and the Visayas who of their own accord go to Mindanao under the law you have authorized. Resettlement work will be pushed through with more intelligence and vigor. The great purpose of this project must not be lost in its detail. It is to vouch­safe to each man a place truly his own. It is not to in­crease the holdings of those who already have, or to increase the number of absentee landlords. These groups do n0t need government assistance. They are capable of taking care of themselves. Settlers shall therefore be selected from areas where feudalistic tenancy still persists to the present day. In view of the limited areas available for settlement in proportion to the great number of landless people, it may be necessary to consider the grouping of such settlers to operate government farms under con­tractual arrangements. In this way, we could accelerate the production of the staple commodities of which we are in daily demand.
For our floating labor populations in industrial communi­ties, I wish to inform you of the progress in our housing program. The housing program for the low-salaried in both public and private employments in the City of Manila is being accelerated. One thousand seven hundred seventy ­one housing units have been built at a cost of over P5 million since 1948. The construction of 655 more is being com­pleted in a few months. Our target for this year is a total of 3,500.
A salutary consequence of this program is the awakened interest that private investors have developed in under­taking similar low-cost housing projects in Iloilo, Baguio, and other centers of population. I have just organized the Home Financing Commission created by Act No. 580 you have recently enacted to supplement and coordinate our home construction policy.
Our disaster relief activities have been effective these past two years. But although well coordinated, they need better support. We felt this great necessity during the last two devastating typhoons, the worst in many years in the Visayan provinces, and during the recent eruption of the Hibok-Hibok Volcano. We have leaned heavily upon our people for voluntary assistance to the victims and casualties of these disasters. I wish to stress the necessity of restoring the appropriation originally given to the Action Committee on Social Amelioration, now merged with the Social Welfare Administration, in order to provide for adequate relief for victims in such disasters and other calam­ities, especially the recent typhoon sufferers.
The victims of the 1951 public disasters will take years to rehabilitate themselves. The coconut industry in the Visayas has been practically totally damaged. In many places it cannot be restored to productivity except by replanting. This means for the next three to seven years sectors of our population dependent upon that industry for a livelihood will have to shift elsewhere. The damages to the sugar, corn, and rice industries are not as extensive but they have set back these industries and their reper­cussions will be felt in the coming months.
PUBLIC HEALTH
Other than the consequences of the great disasters that occurred during the year, the state of the public health may be considered normal. No epidemic visited the country. The birth rate increased; the total crude death rate de­creased. Infant mortality also decreased. At the incep­tion of every natural disaster, public health forces were immediately deployed to take care of casualties and to prevent the development of epidemics.
We must continue to improve the public health to con­serve manpower for the development of our agricultural, industrial, and other natural resources. We have made notable progress in lessening the scourge of malaria, tuber­culosis, malnutrition, mental ailments, and other debilitating diseases.
Environmental sanitation and health education have been promoted. More artesian wells and sanitary facilities have been provided. More hospitals have increased available hospital beds. More charity clinics, puericulture centers, public health nursing establishments, and public health la­boratories have been activated.
Preventive and sanitary measures against infectious and quarantinable diseases have avoided epidemics from indi­genous sources and from abroad through international traffic and trade. The production of more vaccines and sera has been notably increased. Our BCG laboratory is rated the best and the largest in this region. We are pro­ducing vaccines for Formosa and Indo-China, besides filling our own requirements.
EDUCATION
Education is another fundamental of national progress from the standpoint of society and of production efficiency. No legislative body of the Philippines, since the days of the First Assembly, has ever been remiss in generosity for this function of public service. It is our established obsession that no child in the Philippines should be bereft of instruction. I am happy to say that in the past year as well as in the previous two years this Republic saw to it that the so-called school crisis has not recurred.
Last October, upon being informed that thousands of children would not be accommodated, I authorized after consultation with the Council of State the release of P1,630,000 to cover the employment of additional teachers. We have now an elementary school population of four million. In the ratio of school enrollment to total population, we rank next to the United States, the highest of any country in the world.
Through administrative adjustments we helve strengthened the holding power of the schools and have brought about a much lower rate of withdrawal. The two-session program has been partially restored. Increases in enrollment have also been noted in the secondary schools, in normal and technical schools, and on the collegiate level.
Community school programs bringing teachers and pupils closer to their community are being instituted. Work­ing with other agencies, the schools are assisting in im­proving community life along health, social, cultural, and economic lines.
Curricular offerings are being adjusted to inculcate work, consciousness and to provide work experience along the lines indicated by the dominant occupational activities and needs of the community. One objective is the revival of characteristics local cottage industries. You have facilitated this extra-curricular work by your approval of financial support of pre-service vocational, teacher preparation, espe­cially in agriculture, trade, industries, and business.
As an incentive to further vocational training, we have converted the Muñoz Agricultural School into a college, in line with our policy established in the conversion of the Philippine Normal School into a college and various pro­vincial trade and agricultural schools into national regional institutions.
Private schools continue to supplement government efforts in education. But the rapid growth of the private school system poses the problem of effective supervision for the maintenance of scholarship standards at high level.
PUBLIC WORKS TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS
The rehabilitation of the major road and bridge projects undertaken jointly by our Government and the Govern­ment of the United States has been continued and pushed through with vigor during the year.
Ninety percent of the war-damaged water supply systems have been restored to operation. Construction of new waterworks projects, market buildings, bridges, municipal presidencias, and other public improvements financed from revolving loan funds or from loans extended by the Re­habilitation Finance Corporation, is continuing.
The investigation and survey of irrigation projects have been accelerated. Today eight new projects to water 78,500 hectares are awaiting construction, we completed the con­struction of 12 systems this past year, placing an additional 26,400 hectares under irrigation. Four projects furnishing water to another 15,100 hectares are under construction. When the Ambuklao outflow is harnessed, it will irrigate 48,000 hectares from Mt. Province to Central Luzon. The construction off flood control works in the Agno and the Pampanga river basins is proceeding apace.
We finished construction during the year of five adminis­tration, 138 school, four hospital, nine public health, and seven radio station war-damaged buildings, financed partly from U.S. war damage funds, and 47 administration, 212 school, 110 market, 51 general office, 22 hospital, 46 public health, and 90 other miscellaneous buildings exclusively by our government. But the typhoons in the Visayas again wrought havoc, destroying even buildings completed last year, especially school houses.
Twenty national and five municipal ports and 29 light­houses have been rehabilitated and placed in service. Dredging of the Port of Manila, including the esteros, and the Pasig River is now 40 percent completed. Dredging of the Ports of Iloilo and Pulupandan is nearing completion. Five seawall projects have been constructed and repaired. The Dewey Boulevard has been extended. and filling is ex­pected to be completed by May of this year.
Twelve additional post offices were opened. Regular air­mail service to Israel and certain places in Palestine was resumed on May 5, 1951. Effective October 1, 1951, the twice-a-week airmail service to the United States was in­creased to six-times-a-week service. On January 1, 1951, the indemnity system of registration in 65 post offices located in chartered cities and provincial capitals was resumed.
Thirteen radio, seven telegraph, and 14 telephone stations and offices were established. Various telegraph and ra­dio stations in strategic locations are open 24 hours to handle peace and order campaign messages. During the eruption of Mt. Hibok-Hibok, personnel of the Mambajao radio station stuck to their posts night and day. It was only when working in the vicinity was no longer possible that the station was moved to Mahinog where they kept the same vigil.
As a corollary of our aggressive program of increased production, we should adopt a more systematic and ex­panded transportation policy. Nothing can be considered produced until placed where needed for utilization. Progressive society is dependent upon transportation. It is time that, to derive maximum use of our meager resources, we established planned and coordinated programming of public expenditures intended for the provision of transport­ation facilities. Our government is committed to the main­tenance of highways, bridges, port works, harbors, air­fields, air and sea navigational aids. We should begin to explore the problems, possibilities, and potentials of a rail­way system in Mindanao, and provide for the extension of the existing system to Northern Luzon, especially in the Cagayan Valley.
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS
I am happy to report to you that in specific, routine materials, our government has established most satisfactory relations with other governments and peoples, which will enhance not only our relations with them, but our economic well-being by fruitful and mutually beneficial contacts.
We have been able to secure to our people a pledge of unqualified assistance in maintaining our country’s security and its integrity, by the one great power which is in a position to offer and fulfill such guarantees—the United States of America.
Our relations with America remain what they have always been: relations of intimate and understanding alliance. Not just because America needs a base in the Far East, or because the Philippines needs the American market, but because fundamentally there is a bond of mutual ideal and aspiration between the Filipino and the American peoples that transcends the material factors of security and trade.
This ideal has motivated our relations with other free nations. Nor has it militated against our relations, with our neighbors and our brothers in race in this region of the world. Rather, it has enhanced them. For, as our neighbors have gained their well-deserved independence and sove­reignty, it is to the example of basic Philippine-American relations that they turn when they consider their departure from the colonial status.
The routinary aspects of our foreign affairs are well known to you. I shall, therefore, limit myself today in recommending to your serious consideration two important treaty proposals which will be placed before you.
One is the Philippine-American Mutual Defense Treaty. I feel there is no need of special advocacy of this treaty.
The other is the Japanese peace treaty, signed by us in San Francisco in September of last year.
I fully appreciate the reasons for the reluctance which many of you will entertain in considering this document. At this time, all I can say is that our signing of this docu­ment in San Francisco has not been done thoughtlessly, or on pressure, but on a sober appraisal of what is best for this Republic in the state in which the world finds itself today.
CONTINUED VIGILANCE
Gentlemen of the Congress: We can perhaps take par­donable pride in the substantial achievement that we have made in economic, financial and social stability, and in political security. However, in spite of the fact that the climate will probably continue to be favorable for further progress in these fields, I am compelled to say that we cannot relax in our efforts. It is still necessary for us to continue exercising the greatest discretion and vigilance.
There are external factors affecting our economic, social, and political stability over which we have little or no control at all. Let us not add to the problems that they will pose by allowing internal factors, over which we have control, to get out of hand.
Vigilance against threats to our internal and external security must be continued. Inflation must not be permitted resurgence. Our ability to keep it in check de­pends largely upon our determination to continue observing and strengthening the sound fiscal and monetary policies and practices we have promulgated these last three years.
No amount of outside assistance can place our economic development program on a continuing and self-generating basis. It is only our own resources that can serve as the prime mover of our development process.
Within our limits we must sustain our determined effort to push through without delay every project designed to achieve a more balanced economy for our country.
ECA aid is beginning to flow. When it does come in substantial amounts, we should be able to speed up our work.
We should take steps to bring about a review of the Trade Agreement with the United States, to suit changing exigencies consistent with a diversified and balanced economy.
Finally, the increasing vigilance against, and prosecution of, every form of corruption this administration has been waging these past years should suffer no abatement. The record of dismissals, prosecutions, and convictions the past five years must warn every public servant that public service is the highest form of stewardship requiring utmost integrity and strictest discipline. I have wanted, while holding the Presidency, to inspire every man in the public service with pride in the organization to which he belongs, and every citizen with equal pride in his government. And may I say in addition that every public servant, whether in the national, provincial, city or municipal, or even the barrio, should remember that he is in the government to help the people and not to utilize his position to his personal benefit. (Applause)
OUR CONTINUING RESPONSIBILITY
The world in which we live is a troubled, uncertain world. At no period in history have the masses of the world been better informed; yet at no period has there been greater groping, more searching, for a way to peace and to well­being.
In such a world it is with pride, yet with the humility which is our duty to Divine Providence that we look on our own nation, and find in it the hope that is born of faith and nurtured in achievement.
When we consider that many other nations of the world are reeling under impact of the world crisis, our coun­try’s position of over-all security is a matter of some gra­tification. But security-economic, internal and external and the resultant political stability which we have achieved, are a continuing responsibility. No nation can long exist if content merely to maintain a state of security for the current generation, and oblivious of the challenge of its generations to come.
We cannot be complacent. We should bend every effort to make our country stronger, to insure as far as we are able the security of our children.
Nothing is permanent in human institutions except the struggle to maintain and improve them. I ask that you bear in mind this unending struggle along the road on which our people are marching towards their destiny. That destiny, under the guidance of Him who gave His people will and reason, may be shaped by us. But into the labor of shaping it must go not only the goodwill and the calm reason, but the unity of all the people, without which many may £all behind, many may be destroyed, and none may reach the shining goal. Thank you.
NEW ATMOSPHERE FROM NATIONAL UNITY
I therefore appeal to you again for national unity—unity that is not a temporary adjustment of differences, or a mere agreement to vote together on this or that issue.
It is something much deeper. It has its roots and its being in the spirit that moves a man to look to his neighbor as one whose well-being, whose future, is linked with his own. It is the deep-rooted sense that if my neighbor, my fellow-citizen, my brother Filipino comes to harm, I too am harmed; I too will sustain injury. My own children cannot grow and flourish to the nation’s honor, if his chil­dren are denied the opportunity to grow and flourish.
This, gentlemen of the Congress, is what I understand by national unity. Not the expedient unity of the polls, but that unity which brings to us the recognition of common problems, common tasks, common honor, and the need for common struggle. It is unity to face and foil the dangers which continually arise to harass us as a people.
Whatever our political creeds, we must close ranks and lead our people to a new horizon, leaving behind us the doldrums of inaction, mutual suspicion, intrigues, and re­crimination. Let us rise to the challenge of this critical hour and create for our country a new atmosphere, an atmosphere of faith, of courage, of cheerfulness, of determina­tion, and thus inspire our people to greater efforts in our struggle for continued existence. Instead of passively crossing our arms in helplessness and frustration, let us ad citizens of a country with such a heritage of fortitude and courage, arise as one to fight together to give our people a life’ of substance, of strength, of contentment. This is the call that we must heed. To do so is to show the patriotism, the new heroism that this epoch demands.

Message
of
His Excellency Elpidio Quirino
President of the Philippines
To the Joint Session of Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Session Hall, Legislative Building, Manila, at 5:00 p.m., Monday on January 26, 1953]
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the Congress:
I wish to express my gratitude for your generosity and for the concurrent resolution passed by both Houses, inviting me to address this last session of the Second Congress this afternoon. It is not probable that the Executive and the Members of Congress would no longer be on speaking terms simply because certain divergent views have divided us in the recent past.
This Congress came into being at the start of the present administration. We have since faced in common the sharp challenge of extremely difficult problems, putting to severe test not only the vision and quality of contemporary statesmanship but the genius, resourcefulness, and patriotism of our people.
It is gratifying to report in honest retrospect that our Government has buckled down manfully to speed the restoration and improvement of our internal and external security, our finances, our essential public services, and our badly damaged economy.
Owing to the marked improvement in the state of law and order our people have been able to concentrate their attention on the development of their farms, industrial activities, and other productive ventures.
Our external security has been greatly enhanced by a mutual defense treaty with the United States and by the accelerated implementation of our military assistance pact with her, as well as by the clarification and strengthening of our common defense efforts of long standing.
Our finances have been bolstered. Our National Government revenue jumped from P316,302,246.09 in 1949 to P611,460,943.82 in 1952, with the purchasing power of our peso maintained and its value recognized as one of the most stable in the world.
Our national economy has been so improved that the national income has increased from P4 billion in 1946 to over P7 billion in 1952.
We have raised the salary standard, stabilized the status, and liberalized the privileges of the rank and file of the personnel of the National Government, especially the teachers, the nurses, the enlisted men in the Army, and the low-salaried employees, providing adequate pension and retirement systems for them.
Our essential public services have been progressively improved and expanded, spreading throughout the country the benefits of health, education, and social welfare for our people to enjoy. Our death rate has been reduced; our birth rate, increased. The hardy perennial problems of inadequate school space and inadequate rice supply have become things of the past. And what is more, prices have gone down, living standards have been raised, and the lot of the common man, especially the laborer, has been greatly improved.
Our foreign relations have grown and so developed that one of the sources of our strength is in the sympathy and high regard of our friends across the seas.
All these have placed us in a firmer and sounder position, increased our international credit, and enhanced our name and prestige abroad.
I shall endeavor to make a more detailed but cursory review of how we have attained these accomplishments.
INTERNAL SECURITY
The task of advancing our internal security has been closely tied up with the problem of solving the threat of dissident terrorism and violence and of pacifying age-long social discontent. Therefore, we have sought the armed dissident elements in the open field, broken up their potential for organized disorder, and given them opportunity to return to peace and production. It has been a painful, costly, and tedious process, taxing our conscience in the sacrifice, in many cases, of life and property, in order to secure tranquility in our land and preserve our liberties and democratic institutions. Obviously we could not achieve these objectives merely at the point of the gun. We adopted a bold and ambitious program of social amelioration, mobilizing all our resources in an effort to provide a life of substance and contentment to the less fortunate, and cushioning the harsh effects of force with the reward of a home and a farm not only to the dissidents who were vanquished or who voluntarily surrendered and who promised to return to the ways of peace, but also to the so-called landless and homeless among our population. And our watchword has since been “land for the landless, home for the homeless.”
As a result, the Huks, who form the armed forces of the local Communists, are now driven to the mountain fastnesses and isolated hideouts hardly able to gather the remnants of their politburo which has been broken since more than a year ago. Discouraged and disillusioned, their followers are now daily surrendering, many of them starting a new life in settlements prepared for them, in the EDCOR under the Army, and in the mass settlement projects under the LASEDECO.
LAND DISTRIBUTION
We have invigorated the LASEDECO. Until December last, it had already distributed to landless settlers 11,728 farm lots of from 8 to 12 hectares each, covering a total area of 120,000 hectares, besides allocating 11,308 home lots. These settlers are now farming their own land in Cotabato, Bukidnon, Isabela, and Palawan. They have hospitals, dispensaries, and tractor pools. They produce annually approximately 2.5 million cavans of palay, in addition to secondary crops like corn, mongo, and peanuts. There are now in operation, on the other hand, the EDCOR farming communities provided with modern facilities in Kapatagan, Lanao, and Buldong, Cotabato, for deserving dissidents and their families, many of whom now own their farm and home.
These settlers come from areas where tenancy has long existed. To bring the benefits of land distribution and settlement closer to troubled areas and to meet the reluctance of tenants to move far away from their old homes, I have reserved for the purpose 25,475 hectares in Rizal, 3,763.60 hectares in Nueva Ecija and Tarlac, 20,000 hectares in Isabela, in addition to over 30,000 hectares at Malig, already distributed and settled.
During the last year, 11 subdivision projects have been completed by private contractors. Five survey parties of the Bureau of Lands have undertaken subdivision surveys of public lands. Two hundred forty-nine thousand hectares have been surveyed and distributed to 16,000 settler families. To protect small farmers from land grabbers or speculators, I have issued an executive order reserving for occupation in lots not in excess of 10 hectares each all public lands within six kilometers from all highways, being or to be constructed in Mindanao and other provinces under the PHILCUSA-MSA highway development program.
In Mindanao alone this program covers a network of highways connecting most of the important provinces of the region and traversing rich agricultural lands. The total combined length of these highways is approximately 560 kilometers. This will make available for occupation over 650,000 hectares of land under the provisions of said executive order.
These public land distribution and settlement programs supplement the landed estate purchase program. The Government has purchased since 1947 for resale to tenants 25 landed estates with a total area of 44,000 hectares costing over P18 million. Of this amount P14 million still remains unpaid. We had to borrow the purchase money from government banks. Continued acquisition of other landed estates had to be temporarily suspended because further borrowing from government banks would seriously endanger their financial position.
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AND SLUM CLEARANCE
We have accelerated the construction of homes for the low-salaried employees and the laborers. In Quezon City the Peoples’ Homesite and Housing Corporation is now operating 2,116 low-cost units. We have even provided a big-sized Labor Hospital for this sector.
We have also attracted private entities in the construction of low-cost houses for the lower middle class. Already the Philippine-American Insurance Company has constructed 50 of this type of houses in the City of Iloilo, another 50 in the City of Baguio, and is now commencing the construction of 600 new units in Quezon City. A plan is afoot to construct similar houses in Tacloban and Legaspi and other centers of population.
Our program of slum clearance is being implemented with the construction of low-cost houses for squatter and low-income families, one in Pandacan, Manila, and another in Bago-Bantay, Quezon City. The former will house 480 families and the latter will have facilities for 800 families.
With the activation of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement in conjunction with the activities of the Social Welfare Administration and the barangay and purok organizations in the barrios, a new impetus is now reawakening social improvement in the rural areas throughout the country.
LABOR
Underlying almost every major governmental activity is the desire to improve the worker’s lot, better his working condition, improve his earning capacity, create for him widening opportunities for continued employment, and raise his living standard.
At no other comparable period has the workingman achieved greater gains for himself and his co-workers than during the past two or three years. These include: (1) raising his wage standard; (2) promotion of his safety against industrial injury and disease; (3) protection of employees sustaining injury or meeting death in line of duty; (4) improvement of working conditions of women and children; (5) expansion of national employment programs leading towards greater and more stabilized employment; (6) protection of prospective workers from illicit activities of employment agencies; (7) protection of workers against irresponsible union leadership; and (8) raising labor standards in general.
A vigorous and determined campaign to enforce the Minimum Wage Law in both urban and rural areas has been pursued to insure for the workers and full benefits of the law.
PUBLIC HEALTH
Public health has remained at high level despite fires, typhoons, and repeated eruptions like those of Mt. Hibok-Hibok in Camiguin Island, Mindanao. Our health authorities and facilities have proven equal to the heavy exigencies imposed by such calamities.
Better sanitation has been achieved in diverse and effective ways. Stricter supervision over public eating places, markets, and slaughter houses has been enforced. Schools, industrial plants, and commercial houses have been subjected to systematic medical inspection. Immunization of the population against epidemic diseases has advanced where it is now willingly sought by everyone, young and old, rich and poor, healthy and infirm alike. We have spread the benefits of artesian well and sanitary facilities to more sectors, and have established an increasing number of hospitals, puericulture centers, charity clinics, and dispensaries
EDUCATION
The recurring school crisis in past administrations has been met since three years ago. Last year we took the last step in this direction. With the diversion of P2,647,000 from the contingent funds of the Bureau of Public Schools, after consultation with the Council of State, we opened 3,000 new semestral classes in November last, benefiting 150,000 more children. In June this year, 225,000 more children of school age will be accommodating.
We have maintained our world position as the country with the second highest ratio of school enrollment to total population. We are surpassed in this respect only by the United States.
We now have a goodly number of agricultural and vocational schools. Enrollment in these schools has multiplied and soon an increasing number of youths will be leaving their doors properly equipped with vocational skills so essential in our economic development program.
The important role of private schools in the education of our youth deserves mention here. There are now throughout the archipelago 1,770 private educational institutions from the lower grades to university level, with over three-quarters of a million students. Were the government to shoulder their operation and maintenance, P60 million would still fall short of the money so required, excluding the cost of their buildings and equipment.
PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS AND COMMUNICATIONS
We have exerted every effort this past year to maintain and add to our system of highways and bridges and of other means of communications. Nearly 29,000 kilometers of roads and over 9,000 bridges are now being maintained and kept open to motor vehicle traffic. Two weeks ago, I opened the new Pinacanauan and Naguilian bridges in Cagayan and Isabela. These bridges together with the Malalam Bridge near Iligan, Isabela, will provide the Cagayan Valley with a continuous road. The Cotabato and Pagaluñgan bridges in Cotabato, which I likewise opened three months ago, will provide through transportation across the Cotabato Valley linking this region with Davao province. Eight, other bridges and 19 port works projects have been completed. Several large edifices, among them the P450,000 Sorsogon High School building and the P400,000 Cebu Capitol annex, are about to be completed. Being started are the P700,000 Quezon Memorial Mausoleum as part of the Quezon Foundation, and the Roxas Memorial Theater whose plans are being readied.
Nearly 500 wire-telegraph offices, 180 radio-telegraph stations, and over 1,160 postal offices now keep our population centers in close contact.
Related to our agricultural development program is our increasing endeavor to construct new irrigation systems. The Burgos Irrigation Project in Zambales, completed last August, waters approximately 6,000 hectares. Five other irrigation projects in the provinces of Quezon, Davao, Leyte, Ilocos Norte, and Nueva Ecija should be completed and harnessed this year. The construction of the P7,500,000 Jalaur irrigation project in Iloilo to serve no less than 15,000 hectares is starting next month. We now have 27 national irrigation systems servicing over 117,000 hectares of rice lands in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan, Tarlac, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Bataan, Bulacan, Laguna, Quezon, Camarines Sur, Albay, Leyte, Iloilo, Antique, and Zambales.
Sixteen river control projects were completed last year and 35 more are now in varying stages of construction.
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
The level of agricultural production for domestic consumption and for export continues to rise. This year we will be producing enough rice for our own needs. In other food items, such as fish and poultry, production is expanding. Sugar output for the 1952-1953 crop years will not only fill the Philippine quota in the United States for the first time since liberation and our own domestic requirements, but also leave a surplus for other markets.
The total combined production during 1949 of certain selected commodities, like palay, corn, sugar, copra, root crops, etc., amounted to 5,576,000 metric tons. In 1952 this had increased to 7,503,000 metric tons or an increase of 35 per cent in three years. The total area of land devoted to the production of all crops reached 5,326,000 hectares in 1952, which exceeds by 380,000 hectares the 1949 area. At the average of two workers to put one hectare of land into production, we cab see that there were approximately three-quarters of a million more farm laborers who found occupation during 1952, compared t those working in 1949.
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION
Most significant has been the rise of new industries and a corresponding increase in industrial production. In two years and a half, we have established such important new industries as jute, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals, glass, nail, incandescent bulbs, toilet soap, rubber tires, plywood, bond and wrapping paper, asbestos, plastics, musical instruments, kettles, tableware, pencils, chalk, etc. Up to November 15 last, 165 new tax-exempt factories had begun manufacturing articles formerly imported.
This recent industrial development has been made possible by new capital investments, both local and foreign. In the manufacturing industries alone, the amount of private capital invested since 1948 at the time of incorporation has reached P117,942,813.88.
On the whole, investments in corporate and partnership ventures in 1952 were on the same level with those of the preceding year. Filipino capitalists and businessmen were greatly encouraged to adopt modern corporate methods increasingly. We have taken appropriate measures to safeguard public interest and to protect investors by the adoption of methods designed to curb, through rigid examination, the issuance of “watered” stocks by registrant corporations.
From February 1 to April 30 this year, we shall have the first Philippines International Fair. Besides the display of Philippine products together with those of the participating nations to promote world trade, the Fair will also show the agricultural, commercial, and cultural progress of the country as well as the recent advance that we have made in our industrial development.
DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TRADE
Greater efforts have been exerted on the whole towards increased Filipino participation in domestic trade. The capital structure of the corporations and partnerships registered during the first eleven months of the year shows that our nationals lead in both fields, especially with regard to investment of small merchants.
Less than two years hence, the tariff levies on our exports to the United States will be in operation. By that time we shall be manufacturing articles and goods needing export markets and facing stiff competition there. We must therefore, attend to the problem of foreign trade promotion. We must locate markets for our products. This means that our home production should be placed on a competitive basis abroad not only in price but in quality. But more than anything else, our home market should be developed in order to promote our foreign trade.
Philippine foreign trade during the first eleven months of 1952 has aggregated P1,411.8 million, of which P773.4 million represents imports and P638.4 million represents exports. On the basis of these figures, the total trade for the whole year is expected to reach well over P1.5 billion, which will be less than the 1951 total of P1,790,516,663.
There is need for readjusting our foreign trade. We must redirect our productive potential towards agricultural development for self-sufficiency in the prime needs of our people, and towards industrial development base on the utilization of local raw materials. But unless our own countrymen ready and willing to invest in processing, are given adequate protection, they cannot survive in competition with foreign manufacturers. To rise above
subsistence level, and to achieve a standard of living to which we are entitled, we cannot afford to remain permanent suppliers of raw materials for industrial powers and permanent importers to processed consumer goods. It is time to readjust our trade and tariff policies to suit present conditions and to make them more effective instruments of our economic development.
I propose the creation of a Tariff Commission to study the present tariff rates carefully and in detail. This we should do while we present our side to the United States in our desire to readjust our trade relations with her. The Problem is not easy. It will take some time before we can expect concrete recommendations for the required changes. Immediate action is essential not only to hasten our industrial development, but to provide for the necessary machinery or authority to act on the urgent changes or modifications in the tariff schedules to protect our interest in the meantime.
THE GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS
Much of the implementation of our economic development plans is entrusted to the corporations owned or controlled by the Government. Taken together, the operations of these corporations, except those of the Central Bank, the Philippine National Bank, and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation, netted during the fiscal year 1952 a profit of P4,000,000 from a total income of P208,000,000. The three financial institutions made total profits of P24,933,202.43.
The Manila Gas Corporation whose majority stock has been acquired by the Government has been rehabilitated and has been operating since last month.
This year other important basic industries will begin operations. The two principal projects of the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation will be completed—the Mariveles shipyards in March, and the Iligan steel mills in September.
The Cebu Portland Cement Company with its present annual output of six million bags, together with the output of two privately-owned plants, does not fully meet local demand. A new plant of three million-bag capacity is therefore, under construction in Bacnotan, La Union.
The National Power Corporation’s Maria Cristina hydroelectric and fertilizer plant projects will begin operations this May. The Ambuklao project is 15 per cent completed and the transmission lines to Manila are under installation. This project is estimated to cost P101,000,000, of which P61,000,000 has been furnished by our Government and $20,000,000 by loan from the United States Export and Import Bank. When completed it will supply power to the areas around the Mountain Province, to Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Tarlac, Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan, and Manila. Its reservoir will also supply irrigation water to approximately reservoir will also supply irrigation water to approximately 40,000 hectares of rice land in Northern and Central Luzon.
AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL CREDIT
The three financial institutions of the Government, the Central Bank, the Philippine National Bank, and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation have continued the admirable partnership they have virtually established in meeting the credit requirements of Philippine agriculture and industry. Today, there is hardly any commercial, agricultural, or industrial activity of national economic importance which has not been assisted by one or all of these corporations,―the Central Bank indirectly, of course, through the support it has given to the loan activities of the two other institutions.
New arrangements have been made to provide facilities for the financing of industrial development and to meet particularly the credit needs of small merchants and farmers. First, a special trust fund of P10,000,000 has been set up for the special account of the counterpart fund to guarantee a large share of the risk to be assumed by banking institutions granting industrial loans. Second, a plan has also been adopted whereby loans may be granted to Philippine financial institutions by the Central Bank on behalf of the Export and Import Bank from a fund of $5,000,000 that the latter institution has made available as loan for financing small productive enterprises in the Philippines. Third, rural banks are fast being established in various localities under the supervision of the Central Bank and with governmental capital assistance up to 50 per cent of their own paid-up capital out of an allocation of P2,000,000 from the counterpart fund. Lastly, the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration has been established to deal exclusively and directly with one of the most serious difficulties from which the small farmer has from time immemorial suffered; namely, the procurement and marketing credit. For this purpose it has received a contribution of P2,000,000 from the counterpart fund.
THE MSA-PHILCUSA PROGRAM
These last two projects of loan assistance to the small farmers in line with the order programs of mutual economic assistance have been facilitated under MSA-PHILCUSA auspices. But they are but a few of the several projects to which the MSA and PHILCUSA have addressed themselves.
It is meet to note here the history of the Philippine-American Mutual Assistance Program. Upon my representations to President Truman in January, 1950, the Bell Mission was sent to the Philippines in July of the same year. Shortly after the Bell Mission Report in October of that year, Mr. William Foster came to the Philippines as the personal representative of President Truman to conclude with our Government a preliminary agreement known as the Quirino-Foster Agreement of November 14, 1950, providing the basis on which the United States would grant aid to the Philippines in the amount of $250,000,000. On December 15, 1950, the PHILCUSA submitted to the Council of State an interim aid program, and an allocation of $15 million was granted shortly as advance aid to the Philippines. The bilateral agreement, which is the formal treaty governing the Mutual Assistance Program, was signed April 27, 1951. The United States Congress then allocated to the Philippines another $32 million for expenditure within the 1951-1952 fiscal year. Last year it granted us another allocation of $30 million for the 1952-1953 fiscal year. In addition, the Export-Import Bank has recently granted to the National Power Corporation a loan of $20 million for the Ambuklao Hydroelectric project. The total aid thus far allocated to the Philippines since the start of the Mutual Assistance Program now amounts to $77 million in grants and $20 million in loan. Under the bilateral agreement we have to deposit P2 for each dollar of aid granted to us, to form the counterpart fund. Up to this date, our Congress has appropriated a total of P75 million for this purpose. This amount has been bolstered by counterpart funds derived from the sale of commodities, to the extent of P24,715,535 up to December 31, 1951, so that to date the total amount of the available counterpart fund is P99,715,535. A total of P44,691,267 of this counterpart fund has now been authorized to be spent on all projects under implementation.
Despite the initial difficulties and obstacles inherent in a program of the size and scope of these joint entities, they have chalked up already a number of noteworthy achievements. Over 23,700 tons of fertilizers have been distributed to farmers throughout the country, estimated to increase the yield of rice, corn, fruits, and vegetables to more than P19,900,000. The culture of pure rice and corn seeds has been done on 178 hectares of land, 41 hectares of which have already been harvested. Distribution of the seeds harvested to farmers will begin soon and ought to bolster immensely the country’s drive for self-sufficiency in prime cereals.
PHILCUSA’s assistance in the campaign against mosaic has cleared 50,287.03 hectares of abaca land of infected plants. With the rehabilitation of the U.P. College of Agriculture and the establishment of the Central Experimental Station in Los Baños, we now have facilities for agricultural instruction, research, and extension comparable to the best in other countries. Other MSA-PHILCUSA projects basically of a service nature just coming to the fore will improve our facilities for agricultural production, agricultural research, agricultural extension, soil survey and conservation, vocational and technical education, health programs, road development and rehabilitation, and the improvement of manpower efficiency and of production techniques and processes in industry and trade.
THE P200,000,000 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUND
Let us not forget that, even before the inception of the United States aid program, we had already started our own program of economic development using for that purpose the P200 million which was loaned by the Central Bank to the Government under the provisions of Section 137 of Republic Act No. 265 as Economic Development Fund. This fund was allocated to the various government projects upon the recommendation of the National Economic Council, which body likewise approved those projects that were to be undertaken, either by the government directly or through its corporations. The fund was thus distributed and eventually released as follows: (1) P74,677,090.27 to the National Power Corporation for the construction of the Lumot River Diversion Project, the Maria Cristina Hydroelectric and the Ambuklao Hydroelectric Projects; (2) P21,428,688.93 to the National Development Company for the construction of three ocean-going vessels, for advances made to the nail plant, the pulp and paper mills, the Malangas Coal Mines, and the Engineer Island shops, for subscription to shares of stock of the Philippine Electric Manufacturing Co. and the Philippine Air Lines, Inc., and for the construction of the Ilocos Textile Mills in Narvacan, Ilocos Sur; (3) P891,050 to the Cebu Portland Cement Co., to finish the construction of the pulp and paper mills; (4) P20,500,000 to the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation for the construction of the Mariveles National Shipyard and the Iligan Steel Mill project; (5) P15,000,000 to the Land Settlement and Development Corporation for its rice and corn project; (6) P1,984,400 to the Manila Railroad Company for the purchase of ten new locomotives and spare parts from Japan; (7) P10,000,000 to the Bureau of Public Works for the construction of irrigation projects; (8) P40,160,000 to the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation to be used for financing agricultural and industrial projects; (9) P3,500,000 to the Department of Agricultural and Natural Resources for its fertilizer, irrigation pumps, and abaca mosaic disease projects, and (10) P1,843,170.80 to the National Abaca and Other Fibers Corporation for its Davao Abaca project. As of December 31, 1951, there still remained unalloted the sum of P10,015,600, which is reserved for other productive and income-producing projects.
GOVERNMENT FINANCE
Let us now look at our national finances as they bear upon our economy.
Two years ago, we elected for ourselves a goal in the field of fiscal policy which many countries for more favored than us in resources, technical equipment, and manpower have considered unattainable in this age. I am proud to report that in the fiscal year which ended last June 30, we achieved our postwar objective of a balanced budget and were able to match expenditures with revenues.
The latest available figures from the General Auditing Office placed the total income of the National Government for the last fiscal year at P611,460,943.82, as against expenditures of P539,239,957.39. Considering the numerous spheres of government endeavor in which expansion was demanded, the excess of P72,220,986.43 of income over expenditures assumes a happier hue.
We have also progressed in the liquidation of the advances form the Special Funds. In the fiscal year 1952, repayments to the Special Funds aggregated P127,339,715.32, so that as of June 30 last year, only P25 million remained to be refunded. We are addressing ourselves to the eventual repayment of this balance and expect to do this before the close of the ensuing fiscal period.
Local government finances have also noticeably improved. Provincial and municipal governments realized an income of P74,192,000 in the fiscal year 1952. This figure compares favorably with their 1951 performance of P60,830,000. Collections of chartered cities reached P73,712,000, or an increase of P12,623,000 over the 1951 record of P61,089,000. The assessed value of taxable real property in the provinces, municipalities, and cities increased by over P176 million in a year’s time.
While the overall picture appears to be brighter than heretofore, individually, the local governments have still to exert greater efforts towards financial autonomy. Many cannot yet sustain ordinary and essential services or meet legal requirements, like that of the Minimum Wage Law, without allotments from national funds. These fiscal difficulties can be solved. Local boards and councils should early consider measures designed to tap new sources of local income, or to increase prevailing rates of local taxes and fees.
PUBLIC DEBT
The past fiscal year saw a substantial decrease in the public debt by P132,972,858.52. From a figure of P927,327,684.44, at which it stood on June 30, 1951, the public debt has gone down to P794,354,825.92 as of June 30, 1952.
We have complied with the amortization requirements of the loans secured from the U.S. Treasury and from the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Treasury notes and treasury bills are being retired on their due dates, and we have not found it necessary to increase the flotation of such issues. In accordance with the provisions of Republic Act No. 800 which amended portions of the Backpay Law, partial redemption of backpay certificates is proceeding apace. About P10 million has already been disbursed in fulfillment of our commitment to loyal and deserving employees of the Government.
EXTERNAL FINANCE AND THE INTERNATIONAL RESERVE
Largely as a result of our success in maintaining domestic stability in the economy, the problem of maintaining external stability has been greatly minimized. The continuing decline in the demand for, and prices of, our export products, coupled with the many destructive typhoons which in recent months laid waste sizable areas planted to domestic and export crops, resulted in an unprecedented drop of $63 million in export receipts during the first 11 months of 1952. Such a substantial decline could have been fatal to the national economy. International reserves could have been depleted to a point where it could have been difficult to import not only vital raw materials and supplies for our industries but even many of the essentials of life. Fortunately, a reduction in imports by $72 million below that of the 1951 level and a moderate rise in United States expenditures in this country served to offset the big drop in export receipts. It was thus that international reserves have been maintained at a level that is adequate, barring unforeseen world developments and provided that we continue to observe sound fiscal and monetary policies.
On the whole, 1952 has been a year marked by great gains in economic strength, both internally and externally. Inflation, still a major problem in many countries today, and which only a few years back appeared to be impossible of solution in our country, has been checked. The retail prices and the cost of living index of wage-earners during 1952 declined substantially from the level of 1951. Consequently, the purchasing power of the peso today, not only of the middle class but also of the low-income groups, has shown definite improvement. We must conserve these gains.
STABILIZATION OF GOVERNMENT FINANCES
But more than we realize, we stand on the verge of possible retrogression.
I would like now to call special attention to the unfavorable trend which government revenues have taken since the middle part of 1952. On account of the continuing low demand for, and sustained drop of the prices of, our export products which resulted in a decline of about $63 million in export receipts during the first 11 months of 1952, total government revenue from taxation for the current fiscal year which was originally predicted at around P526 million, is now estimated to reach P474,000,000 only.
This unforeseen development will be further aggravated by the expiration this year of some of the tax laws which were purposely enacted to balance government revenues and expenditures. In addition, the foreign exchange tax will be sliced from 17 per cent to 121/2 per cent after June 30, this year.
These factors may compel the Government to resort again to deficit spending which, needless to say, is a situation that we should make every effort to avoid. The inflationary pressures which such a program would generate could easily give rise to a rapid deterioration of our international reserves (because of the augmented pressure they would exert for increase imports) or to a spiraling of prices and cost of living, or to both unsalutary conditions at the same time.
Therefore, I earnestly ask you to consider favorably the extension of the tax laws which will expire this year and to retain the foreign exchange tax at its present rate of 17 per cent. This rate is much lower than the 25 per cent originally recommended by the Bell Mission which saw in the measure an alternative to the import duties that our government is unable to impose on account of the restrictive provisions of the Trade Agreement supplement to the Bell Trade Act.
I cannot too strongly stress the grave aftermath likely to result from any failure to recognize the imperative need to retain these tax laws in full force. Adequate taxation is essential, both to assure a sound fiscal position and to maintain economic stability. It was principally because of the enactment of these tax measures in your first and second sessions, complemented by adequate economic, monetary, and credit policies, that we have made considerable headway in the maintenance of economic stability in our country. We should not lose now by default the victories won these past two years in the economic and fiscal fields.
FOREIGN RELATIONS
In the last twelve months, the Philippines concluded treaties of friendship with Cuba and with the Dominical Republic. It also signed 14 other agreements, three of which were on civil aviation for the extension of our air routes to various countries, and eight with United Nations Agencies providing for various forms of technical assistance to the Philippines.
In view of our expanding relations with other countries, new Foreign Service posts were established; namely, a legation in New Delhi and a consulate in Guam, thereby increasing the number of our existing diplomatic missions to 13 and of our offices to 12.
In order to place our Foreign Service strictly on the merit system and thereby insure its efficiency and effectiveness, I signed Republic Act No. 708, otherwise known as the Foreign Service Act of the Philippines. The placing of diplomatic and consular personnel on a career basis with strict eligibility requirements is expected to bring about still higher performance standards among our Foreign Service personnel.
REPARATIONS AND THE JAPANESE PEACE TREATY
Let me take up with you once more our position in connection with the Japanese Peace Treaty. The Senate did not act on the peace treat during its last session. Technically, therefore, we are still at war with that country. Our failure to normalize and stabilize our relations with Japan has stood in the way of the consolidation and strengthening of the defense of our region against the common danger that threatens the countries that comprise it.
From the economic point of view, the uncertainty of our relations with the former enemy has not served our interest. We must stabilize these relations to take advantage among other things of our favorable balance of trade with that country, and determine how we can strengthen our national economy by taking advantage of proffers of Japanese industrial technical assistance.
To reach an early agreement on the reparations question, which is the only factor responsible for the non-ratification of the peace treaty by the Senate, the Japanese Government sent two special missions to the Philippines. I am confident that as a result of our negotiations with them and our direct dealings with the Japanese Government through our mission in Tokyo, we have made progress towards an early settlement of the reparations problem.
EXTERNAL DEFENSE
In compliance with our commitment to the United Nations’ effort in Korea, we have maintained fighting forces in that area. As in other battlefields, the Filipino soldier has again won additional honors and prestige on that front. He is receiving citations for valiant and heroic action.
Uncertainties continue to hang over the international situation. We shall strive to make further provision for our national contribution towards the efforts of free nations to remain free. The improvement of our domestic situation will enable this Government to devote more time and resources to the development of our defense against threats from without, either through infiltration or through direct attack.
In 1951 we entered into a Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. In the latter part of last year a meeting was held in Manila between representatives of the United States and the Philippine governments to clarify and strengthen the roles that the United States and the Philippines would play in the defense of our territorial integrity, should any threat be poised against it, as well as in the regional security of this part of the world. This meeting also made it possible for our Government to take up possible acceleration of United States military assistance to the Philippines in accordance with our military assistance pact.
World antagonisms notwithstanding, we are determined to contribute however modest to the maintenance of world peace and assist in the preservation of the liberties and rights of free men. From conviction we have cast our lot with the democracies.
Our Government has dedicated itself to the cultivation and fostering of amicable relations with the other peoples of the world, to active participation in the efforts of the United Nations to promote human welfare and maintain world security and peace. We have urged the formation of a system for the common development and defense of the countries of our region. The past year witnessed a perceptible and significant attitude of the responsible powers towards the development of this objective. It is may hope that, in the months to come, it may be possible for the various governments concerned to meet together and work out the basic principles of this project.
CONTINUING PROCESS AND VIGILANCE
I have given you a picture of the important developments during the last three years of our administration. With pardonable pride I can say that they can stand comparison with the record of progress of our nation in any period of our history.
In the face of apparently insurmountable difficulties, in an atmosphere of keen partisanship, aggravated by the confusion, insurgency, and fears fomented by a new world ideology ruthlessly seeking to destroy the very foundations of democratic institutions the world over, we have shown strength of character as a people.
We have been able to put our heads together on matters calling for the highest type of statesmanship. We have achieved that in due course may be characterized as heroic against a backdrop of long and painful vicissitudes. We have established during our time a government stable in its finances and political institutions, rich in promise of yet greater deeds.
But this is a continuing process. It should leave us no time and excuse for complacency. We should and can surpass our past accomplishments and cooperating with one another, solve many of our long standing ills in our time and generation.
Great opportunities are before us, never before presented in the different epochs of our history. With our record of accomplishment, I know we can achieve better things yet. We can continue balancing our budget, prevent the recurrence of any school or rice crisis, and increase the public revenues and the national income in great measure. We can produce more consumption and export goods and manufacture the products which we have heretofore been importing. We can steadily improve our standards of living; assure greater prosperity, satisfaction, and happiness to the masses of our people, individually and collectively. We can attain greater honors by more heroic action in foreign battlefields. We can even say that, in our time, we can write in letters of gold the name of the Republic of the Philippines for our children to cherish.
But all this would be set at naught will have no meaning, and our efforts will be in vain, if we do not employ care and vigilance in the preservation of what we hold dear in our heart and soul as a people. For, in our very midst there are influences not only undermining our stability as a nation but actually destroying the very principles upon which our nation has been founded—our freedom, our democratic institutions, and the way of life we have discovered to be the real source of our happiness.
These destructive influences are active. They always speak to blood baths and revolution. They are determined to overthrow the government and turning their back on the noble sacrifices of our heroes and martyrs, are bent on delivering us to a new power which will ultimately enslave us and our children.
We must stand united to fight them and those who fight for them, if we are to survive as a nation and deliver our precious heritage to the succeeding generations.
We must not be deluded by temporary or personal advantage into allowing these enemies of our freedom and happiness to avail themselves of the confused, precarious atmosphere where they expect to thrive at the cost of our future.
We must give no quarter to them in the open field, in the mountain fastnesses, in the courts, in the press, and even over the radio. Before they destroy us, let us face them and conquer them, face them fraternally if they come to reason and to the folds of the law, and face them as our worst enemy in time of national peril, if they don’t.

Address
of
His Excellency Ramon Magsaysay
President of the Philippines
On the State of the Nation
[Released on January 25, 1954]
Mr. PRESIDENT, Mr. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS:
The Constitution makes us equal partners in the patriotic task of serving our people. I am here today to start the job with you.
What do our people want?
When our people cast their ballots in the recent election, they voted primarily for a great, sweeping change. They voted to throw out dishonesty, inefficiency, and waste. And they voted for a government that would act boldly and effectively, to banish insecurity and fear, poverty and want.
We promised all these things. The people voted for them. Now we must keep faith.
Our first step must be to take an inventory of the nation, to define our problems, and to set our goals.
NATIONAL SECURITY 
Let us turn first to the security of the nation, which must be our prime concern.
I must warn against complacency. Communist imperialism still threatens us from without and from within.
.
Externally, the creeping advance of Communism continues in Southeast Asia despite the truce in Korea.
We must, therefore, move to strengthen our defenses.  It is clearly in the national interest that we meet with the representatives of the United States Government to settle pending legal questions so that the bases we have granted to that. country can be immediately developed and fully activated.
Internally, the absence of major armed conflicts in dissident areas does not necessarily mean that the Huks have ceased to be a threat. They are still trying to undermine the Government, not with as much open defiance as before, but slyly and secretly.
Against this conspiracy we will continue our policy of “all-out friendship and all-out force.” I say again what I have said many times before: we will give every dissident who surrenders new opportunities for decent livelihood, but we will smash those who would overthrow our independent democracy in order to hand it over to an alien dictatorship.

THE LAND PROBLEM
At the same time we will employ the manpower and resources of our .Armed Forces to combat not only dissidence but also the causes which breed dissidence. Troops and trainees of the Armed Forces will be mobilized for the construction of public works and economic development projects, as far as this may be compatible with their primary mission and with economy of operation. This will achieve a double purpose: to give these citizens training in useful and technical pursuits, and to help in the material progress of the nation.
The existing civilian agency charged with resettlement work, the Land Settlement Development Company (LASEDECO), is in such a state of disorganization and disorder, that it may be more convenient to liquidate and replace it than to reorganize it.   I am afraid, however, that it will take some time before we can set up a new and effective agency, and I would suggest that the Engineer Development Corps (EDCOR) be expanded and utilized to help not only surrendered Huks but also those landless Filipinos who have remained loyal.
As much as the finances of the Government will permit, we should also buy large estates for resale to small farmers on liberal terms.
In order to encourage agricultural production and eliminate in absentee-landlordism, I propose that Congress study the advisability of imposing special taxes on lands left uncultivated for an unreasonably long period and without justifiable cause.
Our laws on land registration and the disposition of public lands should be revised.  We should make it easier for our people to get land of their own, free from any nagging technical doubts.
The Government should extend greater protection to· tenants who, because of ignorance or illiteracy, are often badly in need of advice with respect to their rights, especially in the liquidation of their harvests with the landlords. I urge Congress to strengthen the legal staff entrusted with the specific task of rendering this kind of assistance.
Existing legislation on tenancy relations is confusing.
There are too many laws in too many books. We need a single, concise, and easily understood  farm tenancy code.
Our small farmers and producers should find it easier to borrow money when they need it to increase production. This means more rural banks and more ample working capital for the Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA). Producers’ cooperatives should also be properly organized and financed.
Our ultimate goal is to reshape land tenure system in our country in such a way as to build a strong nation of small, independent, and contended farm owners, free from want, protected from injustice, and eager to contribute their share to the welfare and progress of the nation.
HELP TO F ARMERS
But our people must realize that individually, as well as nationally, we must help ourselves.   The fundamental difficulty is that our farmers and workers do not earn enough money, largely because they have not been trained to work efficiently. We must extend the present facilities to educate our farmers in modern agricultural methods, such as the use of fertilizers, mechanical equipment seed selection, soil conservation, crop rotation, and other means to improve agricultural yields.
We should do everything possible to increase the yield per unit area and improve the quality of our export products in order to place us in a better position to compete with other suppliers of the world markets.
The attainment of sufficiency in rice production and distribution is one of our major goals. We shall hasten the construction of more irrigation systems and encourage efforts to increase rice production yields, and at the same time take measures to bring the price of rice clown to the reach of the common man.
The development of cottage industries must be an integral part of our industrial program, not only to produce goods but also to help supplement the low income of our people in the barrios.
In many areas our farmers are harassed by destructive plant pests and diseases. We should help them fight the cadang-cadang disease in the coconut regions, control mosaic disease in abaca, and eradicate rat infection. I trust Congress will provide sufficient funds to finance research and control work on these diseases and pests now threatening our major crops.
IMPROVEMENTS IN BARRIO LIFE
As I have often pointed out, our barrio people do not even have safe water to drink. I must ask your fullest support for the administration’s program of building waterworks and artesian wells all over the country.
Civic-spirited members of our community, particularly the Lions Club and the Liberty Wells Association, have spontaneously taken up the challenge to provide our people with artesian wells. I know you will not do less.
I would also ask Congress to study the feasibility of granting subsidies as a means of encouraging doctors and nurses to establish themselves in those remote areas which now lack essential medical and health services. We must have a healthy manpower as the most essential factor for economic advancement. No nation can go forward when it is crippled by disease.
The Social Welfare Administration has mapped out a definite program of self-help projects designed to put needy individuals back on their feet. It will also cooperate actively in the settlement program and send social workers to the barrios to carry out rural improvement projects.

ENCOURAGEMENT LABOR UNIONS 
In the industrial centers of population this administration is committed to help labor attain maturity so that it may assume its place of responsibility side by side with management. Under my administration, I will not countenance any attempt on the part of the Government or any of its officials to dominate or influence the labor unions.
We will encourage free unionism under responsible, enlightened leadership truly dedicated to the welfare of the laboring masses. But I warn those unscrupulous individuals who would use the labor movement to exploit the workers that their activities will not go unpunished. We will be equally hard with interference by management in labor union activities.

ECONOMIC PLANNING
What we need above all is a coordinated plan, theoretically sound and practically feasible, to increase the national production and provide opportunities for more jobs and higher incomes for our people, particularly in the rural areas. In the past, such programs have not made adequate progress because of ineffective implementation and insufficient support.
I recommend that the National Economic Council be revitalized as a really effective agency to plan and put into effect a truly integrated program for economic development.
Government corporations have been created purportedly for this purpose, but they failed to achieve their objective because they were manned by incompetent or dishonest officials, because they were diverted from their original functions, or because they were unwisely expanded. I have ordered an inquiry into the operations and activities of these corporations, and in due time, I will submit to Congress appropriate recommendations.

GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE 
The Government will henceforth confine itself to those phases of development where its participation is absolutely essential to the public welfare.
Private capital, from sources both at home and abroad, will be preferred to direct government financing, whenever possible.
I hope that our own people will go into new ventures and take full advantage of the incentives now and to be provided by our Government. These economic pioneers deserve our support.
We also welcome foreign capital, assuring it fair treatment. In the past it was perhaps discouraged by the uncertainty of our attitude, and I propose that we mark out clearly a stable basis on which foreign investors can put their capital to work in this country.
My administration is pledged to the eventual elimination of controls. I propose to achieve this gradually as the development of domestic industry and trade renders controls unnecessary. In the meantime, we shall have to maintain them to conserve our financial resources and to channel them to fundamental development activities. Controls will be administered honestly, fairly, and efficiently. We will not permit any government official or employee to utilize them for private gain.

FOREIGN POLICY 
The joint Philippine-American program of self-help, designed to assist our country’s economic development, merits our vigorous support. Together with the representatives of the Foreign Operations Administration, we are now considering ways and means to speed up the assistance program, in our mutual desire to bring its benefits to our people at the earliest possible time. I trust that Congress will provide adequate counterpart funds. We shall also explore other programs of economic cooperation with nations in Asia and with the United Nations.
Most vital to our internal growth and development, however, is our trade relationship with the United States. Our Government has asked for a re-examination of the Bell Trade Act in the earnest belief that the situation in which it was originally considered and drafted has changed, and that a new situation has arisen which calls for a new arrangement. We are confident that the Government and people of the United States will not look upon our proposals with indifference.
Pending the outcome of those negotiations, we must be prepared to adjust ourselves to new conditions.
It is my desire, as well as that of the Vice-President, that our foreign policy serve the economic needs of our people. Consequently, new emphasis will be placed on the promotion of foreign trade as one of our primary objectives. Our foreign service will everywhere have the new mission of contributing directly to the economic stability and expanding trade of our people.
As a good neighbor to the countries of Southeast Asia, we shall participate in all regional activities that will promote closer economic and cultural relations among us.  We have ties with European countries, and, through our Spanish heritage, with the Spanish-American republics. We shall strive to establish mutually beneficial commercial relations with them.
The restoration of normal relations with Japan through an early’ settlement of the reparations issue should open another avenue of prosperous intercourse.

GOVERNMENT FINANCES 
Our principal difficulty, however, is money. Our General Fund deficit, as of June 30, 1953, was P124,900,000. Incomplete data on operations for the six-month period ending December 31, 1953, indicate a further deficit. There are obligations unrecorded in. the books amounting to P99,700,000.  The General Fund owes the various special funds P17,000,000.
Our public, debt, as of September 30, 1953, was P1,070,740,782,79. This figure includes the extraordinary advance of P200,000,000 from the Central Bank for economic rehabilitation and development, all of which has been released;  P550,000,000 in backpay obligations; and P178,400,000 in various budgetary loans.  All these obligations have to be liquidated out of general fund receipts.  If we consider that the average annual income of the Government was less than P600.000.000 in the past, we will readily see that we have a problem of the first magnitude.
We must, therefore, maintain our existing sources of revenue, and discover ways and means of increasing government income without creating new tax burdens.  I am constrained to request Congress to extend the tax laws which have expired, or are to expire, this year. Our failure to do so would mean a loss of about P150,000,000 in revenues, which will impair essential public services.
The honest, realistic, and really economical way to run this Government is to collect the present taxes efficiently, intensively. We must go after tax evaders without favoritism and drive home the lesson on that they deserve no mercy. To this end, I recommend that Congress make the penalties for tax evasion more severe. These increased penalties should take effect after a fixed date, up to which tax evaders or delinquents should be given a chance to settle their obligations.   After the deadline, no compromises should be entertained and the law should be enforced to the letter.
On the other hand, we must tighten our purse strings.   We must abandon the practice of authorizing appropriations far in excess of funds actually in the treasury and those reasonably anticipated.
I recommend that Congress make a distinction between expenses needed to run the government and render essential public services, and those expenses which are really capital investments.
The ordinary operational expenses should never exceed the total revenues in any fiscal year. We must live within our means.  We should not try to balance our budget with loans, as we have tried to do in the past. We must support ourselves.
This does not mean, however, that we are opposed to the financing of capital expenditures to increase production and provide public works, through public borrowing.  Capital expenditures of this type should be regarded as investments in the future economic stability and security of our country.

PUBLIC WORKS
In great part these investments take the form of public works projects.  Politics often dictated when, where, and for how much such projects would be undertaken.   Much money and effort went to waste that way.
Public necessity should now be our criterion.   Our needs are great but our resources are small. This calls for careful planning, intelligent selection, and consistent and economical implementation of projects.
I am for the adoption of a public works program that will bring the benefits of democracy to the nipa huts of the poor. All too often our small farmers have to carry their products to market on their backs because we have neglected barrio roads. These, in turn, would not be fully effective unless they feed a system of national highways.  Our aim would be to make them consist principally of concrete pavements financed through public borrowing, to be serviced from the Highway Fund. The large first cost of this undertaking will be more than compensated in the form of reduced road maintenance and vehicular operational costs.
In the past, our attempts to provide our children with adequate school buildings have been half-hearted, piecemeal.  We should now consider a school building program on a national scale.  I propose the manufacture of prefabricated buildings in plants located in strategic places, from which buildings can be transported to the remotest barrios, where they will he installed with the help of the people themselves. A more rapid pace of school building construction is needed, if we are to accommodate the large number of children coming of school age every year.

MORALITY IN GOVERNMENT 
And now let us consider the moral state of the nation. There is little in the immediate past of which we may be proud. Since the change of administration, we have unearthed one case after another of outrageous corruption, abuse of power, and manipulation of the laws for self-enrichment.  The sordid record is just beginning to unfold. I fear that further inquiry will yield even uglier facts.
What, we have been asked, are we going to do about all this?
We must, first of all, remove unworthy government officials and employees.   Where the evidence so warrants, we will prosecute those who justly deserve prosecution.   Not only considerations of morale and discipline but also the very progress of our work make this demand upon us.· We shall not be able to move ahead for as long as those entrusted with the promotion of the public welfare are busy exploring and exploiting opportunities for selfish ends. We simply cannot tolerate such men in the government. They must go.
I wish to make clear that the spirit of justice, not of persecution, will guide us in this undertaking.  The innocent, the honest and the efficient need fear nothing from us.   This Government will protect and defend their rights by enforcing impartially and without political bias our civil service rules and regulations.  In the Executive Department, I will not permit anyone to exact political vengeance on honest and efficient employees by dismissing them without cause or harassing them in any other way.  The victory we have won is not a license for political persecution.
To guide us in the conduct of public business, we must return to the timeless moral and political principles which we have either forgotten or taken for granted. There is the principle that honesty is the best policy in public as well as in private life. There is the principle that, while politics is indispensable for the workings of democracy, it cannot be superior to the interest of the nation.
In the effort to secure for ourselves and our children a government of integrity and efficiency, I will welcome whatever legislation may be enacted by Congress that will serve to prevent, deter; and discourage corruption, increase the penalty for malfeasance in office, and lay down definite rules of ethical conduct in government.
In the last few years there has been a decline of morality.   Character building alone, without a solid moral foundation, has been found inadequate in developing a sound citizenry. We should improve and strengthen the implementation of the Constitutional provision on optional religious instruction through practical and just measures.
I shall address to the Congress on another occasion  a special message on the problems of students who have proved their right to participate in public affairs, as well as on the need to stimulate and foster the growth of our native culture among our youth.

ACTION AND UNITY 
These, then, are the problems that we are committed to solve. To be sure, many more will arise in the course of this administration. But I sincerely believe that solutions to them will be found, just as I am confident that we· shall be able to dispose of the difficult business at hand.
I must remind you of an all-important fact: that what we have set out to do can be realized only through concerted action and unity. More than ever, we must think, plan, and work as one, with only one supreme goal in mind-the promotion of the welfare and happiness of our people.
Perhaps you will say that the people are asking for a miracle. But they too performed no less than a miracle when in one great irresistible movement they dared every peril to preserve the right to have a government of their choice. Thus, they proved to the whole world, to our friends and enemies, that democracy has come of age in our land, that it has become truly and actively a part of the Filipino way of life.
We have pledged to enrich that life.   We can do it.  We must do it. With the aid of Divine Providence, we shall    begin and continue the work until we shall have fulfilled the great promise that gave our people strength to prove themselves worthy of their heritage of freedom.

Address
of
His Excellency Ramon Magsaysay
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Released on January 24, 1955]
Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of Congress:
Since my first report to you a year ago, significant changes have occurred in our country and in the world.
Here at home, the most encouraging change is not measurable in statistics.
When we took over the reins of government, the nation was demoralized. There was bitter dissension and defeatism.  Our people had lost faith in their institutions and in themselves.
Today, there is a new spirit of confidence in our land.
If this Administration can claim any outstanding achievement during the past year, it is the restoration of national self-respect and the revival of the people’s faith in the democratic way of life. Our people and their Government are now as one, jointly engaged in the grand enterprise of securing for this country the fullness of freedom and prosperity.
In this vital transformation, the role of this Administration has been a modest one.  We have done no more than to activate the resurgence of national self-confidence and to establish the essential conditions for its constructive expression.  If achievements there have been, they have been possible because our people wanted them and worked to bring them about.
In the world at large, the collective strength of the free nations increased sufficiently to deter overt acts of aggression.  Thanks to the free  world’s  readiness to defend the peace, the danger of an atomic war is now less imminent.
But grave dangers still remain.  Communist imperialism has not renounced its objective of world domination.  It is still actively promoting subversion within the free nations.
Even as we meet here, the Tachen islands, only a few hundred miles to the north of us, are aflame under new Communist attacks.  We must remain on guard.
It is against this background that I should like to consider with you today the state of the nation.
NATIONAL SECURITY
We have made positive in the strengthening of the national security.
In the discharge of this basic responsibility, we have sought, first of all the effective implementation by the United States of her commitments under the Philippine-American Mutual Defense Treaty, upon which we must rely principally for our external defense.  America has responded with a categorical commitment of immediate assistance to our country in case of attack; and a permanent Philippine-American Council has been created for the effective implementation of the treaty.
Actually, the United States military bases we now have here are America’s earnest to us of automatic retaliation to aggression.
Our participation in the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, now know as the Manila Pact, has further enhanced our nation’s security.  As the first regional collective defense agreement in our part of the world, this Pact extends the collective security system envisaged by the United Nations Charter.
Thus, by every possible defense arrangement—bilateral, regional, and international—we have strengthened our external defense.
Our internal security has improved.   The alertness of the Armed Forces brought about the surrender of Luis Taruc and the death of Mariano Balgos, two of the top Communists in the Philippines.  Still other Huk leaders and followers have surrendered or have been either killed or captured.  Many Huk-infested areas have been cleared and put back to productive use.
I must say here that these successes in the restoration of public order would not have been possible without the loyal support and cooperation of the civilian population.
All this notwithstanding, I must repeat my warning against complacency.  We must continue to be alert to the dangers of Communist aggression and subversion.  Our gains in the restoration of peace in our countrysides must be consolidated.  Our armed forces must continue to protect our farmers and their homes.  We cannot as yet afford to lessen either our vigilance or our armed strength.
RURAL RECONSTRUCTION
But there is more to national security than simply maintaining territorial integrity and public order.  To be really secure, a country must assure for its citizens the social and economic conditions that would enable them to live in decency, free from ignorance, disease, and want.
Today, a concerted effort is being exerted to bring about these conditions in our rural areas.  Varied elements of our society—the Government, the youth, civic-spirited individuals and organizations, the rural people themselves—all are engaged in the great undertaking of bringing freedom and progress to our barrios.
We are approaching the problem along three main lines:
First, improvement of our land tenure system, supplemented by land resettlement:
Second, more effective aid to tenants and small farmers in the form of (a) credit on easy terms; (b) essential facilities, such as water and roads; and (c) technical advice on how to improve farm operations; and
Third, more intensive community development with emphasis on self-help.
The first approach, land reform, gained headway with the approval of the Agricultural Tenancy Act last year.  This law extends greater protection to tenants.  More important still, it grants them the option to choose the system of tenancy under which they would prefer to work.  By choosing the leasehold system, a tenant, of his own free will, takes an important step towards economic independence.
To implement the Act, we have established the Agricultural Tenancy Commission.  In the short time that it has functioned, this Commission has already proved effective in assisting tenants in the exercise of their rights.   I would recommend, therefore that Congress provide it with needed funds.
However, it is not enough to provide tenants with this type of assistance.  It is equally necessary that tenancy disputes be settled with dispatch.  Hence, I would reiterate my recommendation for the creation of a Court of Agrarian Relations.
Another essential measure in land reform is the purchase or expropriation of large estates and their distribution to their occupants and to landless workers.  Mainly owing to lack of funds, we have been unable to implement this measure to any large extent.  I would urge Congress to consider anew ways and means to carry out the redistribution of large estates.
We have however, distributed public lands to landless workers at a fast rate.  Last year, the Bureau of Lands issued to qualified settlers 28,000 land patents, covering 241,000 hectares.  Compared to the 10,000 land patents issued in 1953 and the 3,000 issued in 1952, last year’s total constitutes a record.
Nevertheless we must accelerate our pace.  Our people, on their own initiative, are moving to public lands opened and subsided for settlement.  This is indicated by the fact that during the last year 33,000 applications for agricultural lands were filed by independent settlers.
For others who, due to poverty, are unable to proceed to settlement areas by themselves, the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) has opened several settlement projects. NARRA assists families to move from congested rural areas to these projects, providing them with farm implements, transportation, subsistence up to the first crop, and other forms of aid.
Under this Administration, NARRA moved 2,882 settler families from crowded rural areas to about 27,000 hectares of public land.  In addition, it allocated 10,000 hectares of public land to 1,718 landless families who pioneered in the settlement areas, and helped them in the survey of their clearings and in the acquisition of land titles.  NARRA spent during the year under review P1.3 million of which 77 per cent went as direct aid to the settlers.  I would recommend that Congress appropriate the funds already authorized by it for NARRA.
Our second approach consists in assisting the poor farmer get on his feet.
In most cases, the vicious circle of inadequate production and insufficient credit has kept him in dire property.  The Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA) has begun to break that circle by making available to small farmers credit on easy terms.
At the same time, ACCFA helps them in setting up marketing and warehousing facilities, through their own cooperatives.
During the last year, ACCFA greatly intensified its aid to farmers.  As of December 31, 1954, it had released a total of 18.9 million pesos in loans of various types of farmers.  It had organized 232 Farmers Cooperative Marketing Associations (FACOMAS) in Central and Northern Luzon and Cotabato, with a total membership of 105,943 farmers.
ACCFA’s operations are still in their initial phase.  They have covered only 2,375 of our 18,000 barrios.  Yet, they already count with the enthusiastic support of our people.
One very encouraging aspect of ACCFA’s operations is that the small farmers pay their crop loans on time.  In the past, crop loans were seldom, if ever, paid.  Under this Administration, there has been an important change of attitude on the part of our farmers.  This healthy trend proves once more that it is sound business to invest in the people’s welfare.
Clearly, ACCFA should expand its operations.  I would recommend that Congress increase its capital.
The Farmer’s pressing need for irrigation is gradually being met with our irrigation construction program, which we started to carry out vigorously during the past year.
Four irrigation projects financed by public works funds, covering a total area of 9,000 hectares, have been completed or are nearing completion.  PHILCUSA-FOA funds have financed one completed project in Nueva Ecija; another in Iloilo now nearing completion; and still another in Isabela to be completed before the end of this year—covering a total area of 42,100 hectares.
In addition, we have started work on seven irrigation projects—the Agno River project in Pangasinan; the Sta. Cruz and Mabacan River projects in Laguna; the Daet  River project in Camarines Norte; the Agos River project in Quezon Province; the Pañgiplan River project in Negros Occidental; and the Suague River project in Iloilo.  These projects covering about 40,000 hectares and estimated to cost P22 million, are being financed from bond issues.
Another essential feature of this program is the development of communal irrigation systems.  An expenditure of P957,254.40 was incurred for the construction of 90 communal irrigation systems in 27 provinces.
I have also earmarked one million pesos from the Contingent Fund for the purchase of cement which the Government will contribute for the construction of permanent communal irrigation systems to be built primarily by the barrio people themselves, who, for their part, will contribute labor, sand, and gravel.  Farmers from Nueva Vizcaya and La Union were the first to avail themselves of this joint venture between the people and their Government.
Wherever feasible, the gravity irrigation systems are now being supplemented by pump irrigation facilities.
To speed up the implementation of our irrigation construction program, existing administrative and financing policies on water utilization and water rights should be re-examined.
To provide potable water, more than 1,300 artesian wells have been completed to date in the barrios at a cost of 3.5 million pesos.  This means that we have installed an average of four artesian wells each working day.  Compared with the total of 153 artesian wells installed in 1952 and 256 in 1953, this constitutes a great improvement.  This year, as we get additional drilling equipment, we expect to better this record.
While on this subject, I would like to commend the splendid cooperation of organizations and individuals, led by the Liberty Wells Association, in the Government’s artesian wells program.
Fifteen waterworks projects costing 2.5 million pesos have been completed.  Forty more, with an estimated total cost of 25.5 million pesos, will be constructed within the year.  Work is now going on in over 80 spring development projects which will benefit about 90,000 people.
Next to water, road facilities are essential in improving the farmer’s lot.  This brings us to the Administration’s highway and feeder road program.
During the past year, we have constructed about 430 kilometers of feeder roads serving about 80 communities and opening new areas.  In Mindanao, we have started the construction of 235 kilometers of roads which, when completed, will open large areas of agricultural, forests, and mineral lands, and connect the coastal with the inland towns.
About 479 kilometers of roads were also improved in various parts of the country, of which 82 kilometers of asphalt and concrete pavement were completed.  The improvement of the interprovincial network was started on 90 projects covering a total of 385 kilometers of concrete paving and 182 kilometers of asphalt and 29 permanent bridges.
Aside from the foregoing, which were financed or are being financed from the Highway Fund, we have also started construction on 19 road projects and eight bridge projects, with an estimated cost of 20 million pesos, to be financed by funds from bond issues.
During the first year of the program, much of the work consisted in developing practical and efficient operating methods better planning and allocation of funds, and the organization of equipment depots and maintenance crews.  This year we expect the program to gain momentum.
We propose to concentrate our work primarily on feeder roads to reach our long-isolated barrios.  Considering our lack of funds and the enthusiasm of our rural people, I would suggest that Congress approve the necessary legislation authorizing the construction of feeder roads on a self-help basis.  The Government shall provide the funds, know-how and equipment; and the people, their labor and locally available materials.
The yield of our farming not enough to support our small farmers.  They are eager to produce more, but they know only antiquated farming methods.   To help them, the Government is providing throughout the country technical advice on improved farming methods, through the agricultural extension service and other agencies.  Better breeds of animals and high-yielding varieties of rice have been introduced.  Soil classification and analysis have been extended to many areas, largely through the untiring efforts of the field men.   Special mention should be made of the Margate system of rice culture as a direct means for improving the rice yield.   It is now being introduced all over the country.
As we help our people become better farmers, we also encourage them to make their barrios better places to live in.  We tell them that the Government cannot do everything for them, that they must also help themselves.
Their response has been most heartening.  The spirit of self-help is sweeping our rural communities.  Here again, the role of the Government is simply to tap the creative energies of our people and to provide the means by which their desire for improvement can be translated into permanent benefits.
It is for this purpose that our health, education, and social welfare programs are being re-oriented with emphasis on self-help.
In the campaign to control and eventually eliminate mass diseases, the active cooperation of our people is being enlisted.  Our aim is to increase the effectiveness of the campaign and to make its effects more lasting.  The approach has been especially useful in the successful BCG vaccination and malaria control campaigns.  More than 1,000 rural health units have been established as a joint venture of the national and local governments, with FOA assistance.
The pre-fabricated schoolhouses now being mass produced will be set up in the barrios, also on a self-help basis, with the people providing the labor. We expect the steady flow of these schoolhouses to our barrios to start by next month.  Meanwhile, the emphasis on vocational education is being increased and the community school movement, using the methods of grass-roots democracy, is being extended throughout the country.
The Social Welfare Administration has expanded its services to the rural areas and is taking an active part in community self-help projects. This is being done in accordance with a planned shift from relief to self-help activities.  At the same time, it has carried on more effective disaster relief operations and maintained essential welfare and rehabilitation services.
These varied social measures—for better health, wider opportunities for education, and more gainful employment-are now being carried out, with the use of more efficient techniques of community development. Coordination and integration on a national scale will be effected through the newly-created National Community Development Planning Council.
As a result of our combined efforts in agricultural extension work and community development through self-help, total production in agriculture increased appreciably last year.  National production of the principal food items reached 7.2 million metric tons, showing a self-sufficiently ratio of 114.6 per cent.  But this achievement is still short of consumption requirements in such critical items as meat and poultry, milk and dairy products, cacao and coffee.
Despite vigorous measures, we have not as yet solved stubborn rice problem.  Palay production was not enough for our people’s needs.  But deficiencies in marketing, warehousing, and financing prevented the rice from reaching the consumer at fair prices.
The NARIC should, therefore, be provided with enough funds for stabilization operations.  The coordination of the activities of the NARIC and the FACOMAS must be improved.
As a further measure to increase rice production, the carabao, indispensable to most of our farmers, must continue to be protected from slaughter.  To improve our nutrition, other livestock must be increased in number. We note that during the past year, the number of our carabaos rose to 2.7 million, showing an increase of about nine per cent.  Because of this increase and the ban on their slaughter, the price of carabaos has gone down considerably, making it easier for the poor farmers to acquire them.
As we shift from deficiency to surplus production in the next two or three years, we must meet the problems of marketing and processing.  Together with the farmer’s cooperatives, private trade organizations will have to assume the brunt of responsibility for the efficient handling of our principal products.  We should, therefore, encourage more of our people to go into these activities.
At the same time, the Government should continue its policy of maintaining the floor price for rice and other principal products as an incentive to real, substantial gains in production.
LABOR
When this Administration assumed office, we promised to encourage free unionism under responsible leadership.  We have kept our pledge.
The number of workers organized into labor unions nearly doubled during the past year.  This means that labor has improved its collective bargaining position for better wages and working conditions.
The Government’s role in this growing movement has been, not to dominate as in the past, but to provide the necessary guidance so that will be free, democratic, and responsible.  Among other activities to achieve this end, short-tern regional schools on responsible labor leadership have been conducted in different regions of the Philippines.  This program, together with a similar training program for employer and management groups, will be expanded until we shall have brought about better understanding of labor and its problems.
By and large, labor-management relations improved. More collective bargaining agreements were signed.  With further encouragement, many more will be signed this year.
The enforcement of laws and measures for the protection of workers was intensified.  The Workmen’s Compensation Commission finished twice as many cases as it did in 1953.  The Wage Administration Service (WAS) secured for worker claimants a total of 1.5 million pesos in wage restitutions.
On the subject of wages, I would like to reiterate my conviction that only the most compelling reasons clearly related to the national interest could justify changes in the Minimum Wage Law.  This Administration will not lightly regard any action that may adversely affect the workman’s continuing struggle for a decent life.
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
In the field of industrial development, some progress has been achieved by private enterprise with government stimulus and encouragement.  Induced by tax exemptions, 72 new industrial plants were established during the year.  More processing industries are utilizing local raw materials.
Encouraging results in manufacturing and processing are evident from the increase by 28.2 per cent in the output of reporting manufacturing establishments, which amounted to 752 million pesos in 1954, compared to 586.5 million pesos in 1953.  Another index of the improving industrial situation is the increase by 24.5 per cent in capital-goods imports, amounting to 125.2 million pesos, for the first eight months of 1954, compared to the same period in 1953.
To supplement private enterprise, the Government has taken direct measures to promote certain industries.  During the year under review, the cement plant at Bacnotan, La Union, was completed and the Insular Sugar Refining Company (INSUREFCO) reopened.  The Government has organized the machinery to handle the promotion and development of the coconut and tobacco industries.
On the other hand, the Government has leased the Manila Hotel to private enterprise announced the sale to private operators of three ocean-going vessels owned by the National  Development Company, and withdrawn from international airline operations.  It is also considering other measures in this direction, in accordance with its policy of confining its investment activities to those phases of development essential to the public welfare.
Likewise in line with the policy just stated, the Government has advanced the power development program, an essential pre-requisite to industrial growth.  During the year, the Talomo No.2-B hydro-electric plant in Davao was completed.  Work continued according to schedule on two big projects at Ambuklao and Cristina, with a combined capacity of 100,000 KW—as well as on four smaller hydro-electric projects at Digos and Talomo, Davao; Balombong, Catanduanes; and Amburavan, La Union.  Work has been started on four more small hydro-electric projects, with a total capacity of 4,500 KW located at Peñaranda, Nueva Ecija;  Loboc, Bohol;  Barit, Camarines Sur;  and Agusan River, Bukidnon.
Viewed against the immensity of our needs, these developments are modest, indeed.  They do not measure up to our hopes of a greatly accelerated industrial pace that would provide work and abundance for our people.
But they do indicate the significant fact that we are steadily forging ahead.  What is more, an atmosphere of optimism and enterprise has been gradually developing and is becoming manifest in the form of actual projects and those in prospect this year.  This has been accompanied by a growing realization of the necessity of providing incentives for and promoting industrial growth.
Last year, I recommend in my state-of-the-nation message that we support our own economic pioneers and set up a stable basis under which foreign investors can put their capital to work in this country.
Congressional policy on these matters is as necessary as executive action.  I, therefore, reiterate my previous recommendations.  To particularize, I would urge the adoption of legislation embodying the following policies:
Our Government should give full encouragement to the establishment by private enterprise of new industries which will advance economy.
Our development program must be based, and should rely mainly, on internal financing.   We must promote the widest and most effective utilization of our resources.
We will welcome foreign capital.  To encourage and facilitate its entry, we should specify the conditions governing the repatriation of capital, the remittance of profits and earnings, the protection of foreign investment, and other essential conditions.
I cannot over-emphasize the urgent need for these measures.  We are facing a tremendous unemployment problem.  The direct, practical way of meeting it is to create jobs through the establishment of new industries.
NATIONAL FINANCES
The country’s financial position is stronger today that it was a year ago.
The banking system is more sound.  According to Central Bank data, as of October 31, 1954, total bank resources amounted to P1,335,000,000, showing an increase of P64,600,00 compared to those of the same period in 1953.  Total deposits amounted to P964,300,000, increasing by about nine per cent.  Saving and time deposits in all banks amounted to P414,800,000, showing an increase of P61,500,000.
While the financial status of the banking system is sound, their lending operations need improvement.
As of September 30, 1954, the total loans granted by all banks amounted to P337,800,000, which sum is greater by P28,400,000 than that of the previous year.  Of these total loans granted, those for commercial and real estate purposes increased considerably, while those for industry and agriculture decreased.  This decline indicates that we have not as yet changed the customary pattern of bank lending in this country.
I realize that complex forces make it difficult to bring about the desired shift which will give due emphasis to industrial and development loan financing.  But this re-orientation in objectives is imperative.
A re-examination should be made of our lending policies with a view of expanding development loans.  I would urge Congress to examine the various proposals on this matter and enact implementing legislation either to extend the operations of our existing credit institutions or to establish new financing machinery for industrial and agricultural development.
We should also consider the extension of more substantial credit assistance to small enterprisers and producers.  The recent credit assistance given by the Philippine National Bank and the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation to small producers of rice, cassava, citrus, ramie, coffee, and livestock, is in the right direction.
We have maintained our international reserves at a satisfactory level through the exchange control measures of the Central Bank.
There have been, however, an unfavorable balance of trade amounting to 93.7 million pesos, and an adverse balance of international payments, amounting to 13.6 dollars, as of November 30, 1954.  These are symptoms of fundamental defects in our economy.  They must be remedied to attain internal stability.
One remedial measure is the conservation of our dollar reserves through the proper allocation of dollars among top-priority imports, giving special emphasis to capital-building items, raw materials, and basic necessities.
A more permanent approach to this problem would be the adoption of program to promote foreign trade and to increase our exports.
I would, therefore, ask Congress to consider the advisability of creating a Foreign Trade Commission to plan a foreign trade program and pursue its implementation; the establishment of Bureau of Standards in the Department of Commerce and Industry, to help standardize Philippine products, especially those for export; and the creation of a Maritime Commission that will undertake he promotion and development of adequate water transportation.  Proper incentives for the increase of our exports should be seriously considered.
In connection with the foreign trade program, I wish to emphasize that the proposed revision of our trade agreement with the United States will require vital readjustments in our economy.  We should anticipate and be prepared to meet the impact of the new situation.
GOVERNMENT FINANCES
In the first year of this Administration, Government finances improved.
In my state-of-the-nation message last year, I stated that the ordinary operational expenses should never exceed the total revenues in any fiscal year.  This we have complied with.
For the first eleven months of last year, the General Fund income totaled P545,949,737.13, against total expenditures of P535,197,009.81, thus showing a surplus of P10,752,727.32.
In the same period of the preceding calendar year, the deficit amounted to P48,739,577.25
Thus, the practice of deficit spending for ordinary operating expenses has become a thing of the past.
Revenue collections increase by P43,789.669.84.  This is the result of greater effort in tax collection, as well as a manifestation of the new confidence in the Government.
We have succeeded in reducing the operating expenses of the Government by P37,967,112.26.  Since December 31, 1953, we have succeeded in restoring to the various special funds a total of nine million pesos, out of 17 million pesos owed by the General Fund under the past administration.
On the other hand, we have increase capital expenditures for economic development by 22.3 million pesos during the past year.  This is an investment in the economic stability and security of this country.
Our public debt, as of December 31, 1954, was P1,168,000,000 of which 848 million pesos was incurred by the National Government; 253 million pesos by government corporations; and 67 million pesos by provincial, city, and municipal governments.  The increase of 65.4 million pesos in the public debt outstanding by the end of 1954 was largely due to the Administration’s policy of accelerating economic development.  This is evidence by additional issues of Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) bonds aggregating P59,000,000, increased flotation of National Power Corporation (NPC) bonds amounting to P6,400,000,000 ACCFA obligations of P7,000,000, and the sale of new public works and economic development bonds totaling P11,900,000.  However, budgetary debts contracted by previous administrations have been reduced by P18,900,000.
The improvement in government finances during the first year of this Administration does not mean, however, that we are anywhere near solution of the Government’s financial problem.  The General Fund deficit and the unrecorded obligations of the Government, amounting to P275,260,000 as of December 31, 1953, must still be settled.  Outstanding budgetary loans amounting to P160,000,000, plus P550,000,000 in backpay obligations, must be paid.
It must be clear by now that even with he increase in revenue by P43,700,000, the ordinary income of the Government is not enough to provide for all essential services.  Among these are the training of reserves for the citizens’ army, the restoration of the seventh grade in the elementary schools, and the salary adjustments of teachers and other government employees, which have been deferred.  Some important projects had to be curtailed.  We are studying these problems very seriously, especially the salary adjustments of teachers.  I will send you a special message on these matters in due time.
Owing mainly to fund limitation, our program of capital expenditures fir top-priority public development projects and public works has not been fully implemented.
Thus, our principal difficulty today, as at the beginning of our Administration, is still lack of funds.  I would urge Congress, therefore, to give full consideration to the need for additional appropriations to expand and improve the tax collecting agencies, particularly the Internal Revenue and the Customs bureaus.
I must reiterate my previous recommendation for legislation imposing heavier penalties for tax evasion.
Realizing that our current tax collection are not sufficient to provide for all essential public services, we must redouble our efforts to improve the tax collection machinery so that all the essential operating expenses of the public service could be met.
The financing of capital investments and permanent public improvements for economic development is another matter.  We must be prepared to increase existing tax rates, levy new taxes, or resort to public borrowing for the purpose of accelerating or economic development.
However, we must not countenance the use of this last-mentioned method of financing for operating expenses, except in very extreme cases involving national calamities.
ECONOMIC PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION
In my state-of-the-nation message to Congress last year, I emphasized the need for a coordinated program of economic development.
At my behest, the staff of the National Economic Council drafted a five-year program, the general outlines of which I presented to the nation in an address at the Far Eastern University on March 20, 1954.  The modest record which I have just reviewed, follows the general pattern and objectives of that program.
Our five-year plan has never been intended to be the last word in economic planning.  It is a continuing one.  It is to be revised and updated each year, on the basis of past performance, changing conditions, and the prospects of further advance.
In this constant work of revision, constructive criticism is always welcome.  I am happy to note the mounting interest in the first revision of the program now underway, which indicates popular support of this Administration’s objective of coordinated and integrated economic development.
I must reiterate, however, the recommendation made in my state-of-the-nation message last year for the revitalization of the National Economic Council (NEC) as a really effective agency to plan and put into effect the economic development program.  I would also recommend other essential administrative and organizational reforms to fully implement the program, such as the establishment of a development financing agency to arrange for the financing requirements of the program.
We have found that fundamental weaknesses in the existing administrative machinery cannot be corrected by administrative action.  These will continue to hamper our efforts, as they have in the past unless corrected by legislation.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
While we have devoted much or our energies to the problems at home, our international relations have not been neglected.  Our foreign policy has served as an effective instrument in the promotion of the national interest.
As I have noted, we have strengthened our national security through various defense arrangements.
Similarly, we have made progress towards economic stability.  The most important step in this direction was the conclusion of the negotiations for the revision of our trade relations with the United States.  The Philippine Economic Mission headed by Senator Jose P. Laurel deserves the gratitude of our people.
The spirit of mutual respect and understanding in which the negotiations were conducted reflects credit equally on the Philippines and the United States.  It is yet another manifestations of the desire of both countries to maintain their close and mutually beneficial relations.
Here at home Philippine-American collaboration was closet in the joint undertaking to assist our country’s economic development, through the PHILCUSA-FOA program.  With the wholehearted cooperation of the FOA mission staff, we have succeeded in speeding up the various projects, many of which are now being transferred as regular operating units of the different agencies of our Government.
I trust that Congress will continue to provide the necessary counterpart funds as well as the supplementary appropriations needed to operate the essential projects in this effective joint aid program.
We have also strengthened our ties with several Asian countries.  Diplomatic relations with the Republic of Korea have been established.   We have extended official recognition to the new sovereign states of Laos and Cambodia.  We have reached agreement with the Republic of Indonesia on the problem of immigration.
At the Manila Conference held last September, we helped advance the cause of freedom and self-determination in Asia by our sponsorship of the Pacific Charter and its unanimous approval.
In the interest of peace and economic progress in this region, we joined the Colombo plan as a full-fledged member.  We have continued to cooperate with the Arab-Asian members of the United Nations in matters of common concern.
In the United Nations, we have actively cooperated with like-minded states in strengthening the fabric of international peace and security.  We shall continue to uphold the United Nations Charter.
The balance sheet of our international relations shows encouraging gains.  But we still have before us a catalogue of unfinished business.
The reparations questions remains to be settled.  There is urgent need for the full implementation of the United States military assistance.  The system of joint military defense and economic collaboration envisaged in the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty is yet to be worked out.  The signatories to this Treaty are due to meet soon in Bangkok.  I hope that the Treaty may be ratified by the Senate before that meeting.
The proposed revision of our trade agreement with the United States will require action on your part.  I shall address a special message to you on this matter at the appropriate time.
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE
This Administration has made every effort to secure for our people the material benefits of democracy.  It has worked equally hard to build up the spiritual strength of the nation.
To this end, we have insisted upon the strict observance of morality in the conduct of government business.  We have moved swiftly and sternly against proven acts of abuse, injustice, and corruption.  On the other hand, we have gone out of our way to commend worthy and civic-spirited acts.
The Government has looked promptly into reported irregularities.  The Presidential Complaints and Action Committee has rendered valuable assistance in this regard.  It has helped to make the Government truly a government of the people.
In the past, many of our people who had legitimate complaints did not air their grievances because of distrust or fear.  Others thought it useless to go to a government deaf to their pleas.  Under this Administration, the people in their simple faith have not hesitated to come forward for redress.
Out of 59,144 complaints received by the PCAC up to the end of last year, 31876 cases were closed and 26,780 were being followed up in the different government offices.  In the PCAC itself only 497 cases were still pending.   What  cannot be expressed by these or other statistics is the service agency has performed in demonstrating to our people that this is a Government truly responsive to their will and their needs.  The PCAC has done a good job and should be given every facility to carry on its important task.
I am aware of our people’s desire to see quick results in punishing the guilty and ridding the Government of those who would pull it down by their greed and dishonesty.  We are pledged to satisfy that desire by every legitimate means.
However, we cannot, we must not ignore the democratic processes which it is our duty to uphold.  I must state once more that under this Government, no one—whether friend or foe, citizen or alien—no one will be denied due process and the equal protection of the law.  But, consistent with these principles consecrated by our free way of life we will continue to wage uncompromising war on corruption and abuse.
Respect for basic human rights must continue to be one  of our prime concerns.  We must live up to our pledge to act as guardians of the dignity and worth of the individual.
THE YEAR AHEAD
These are the things that have been done and the things that still must be done.  The past year has been, above all, a record of the achievements of the people themselves.  It has also been witness to our honest endeavors in the task of enriching our people’s.
To be sure, the high hopes of our people have not all been fulfilled.  Some of the things expected of us have not been done—or not done well enough—perhaps because they simply could not be done; perhaps because we have not had time enough to do them; perhaps because we have been momentarily distracted from our task.
Let us admit: among some of our people, there is impatience—the impatience of great expectations born of the boundless faith reposed upon us by our people.
Far from discouraging us, this should give us fresh inspiration to outdo ourselves, to live up to our people’s faith, to spend ourselves to the limit to promote their happiness.
Far from dividing us, it should bring us closer together.  Our people have closed ranks; we can do no less.  Nothing useful, nothing permanent, can be built on a foundation of disunity.  More than ever before—in all matters involving the common welfare—we must provide a united leadership worthy of the confidence and support of all our people.
It is with this firm resolve that we should—together—look forward to the year before us.
The goal set is high.  The accumulation of past and present problems, heavy.  But you and I face them squarely—not alone, but with our great people at our side, equally determined to achieve the impossible, equally eager to give their all, that our nation may live in dignity and freedom.
May God look upon us today and give us the strength and wisdom to serve our people devotedly and well.

Address
of
His Excellency Ramon Magsaysay
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Released on January 23, 1956]
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS:
We are at the half-way mark of our tenure. It is time, I believe, to restate the basic philosophy of our Administration.
When our term began, I announced that the happiness and security of the common man would be foremost among our goals. With material help we would enable him to achieve self-competence, prosperity, and contentment. With spiritual guidance we would foster in him a wholesome attitude toward work, toward his Government, and toward his fellowmen.
Let me emphasize at this point that my concern for the common man is not merely sentimental or emotional. It is a hard fact that a nation cannot survive without the safe foundation of a prosperous and contented majority of its citizens.
We believe that what is good for the common man is good for the whole country. Every policy of our Administration has therefore been directed to his welfare. We have anchored our national destiny to the common man.
In this endeavor we have addressed ourselves, first of all, to the task of rural development. In the rural areas lies the bulk of our natural and human resources, the real wealth of our nation. We must gear them to each other and spark the latter into action so as to achieve expanding production to meet the requirements of national prosperity and security.
Our accomplishments in the rural areas constitute, I believe, the most concrete achievement of this Administration. We have gone a long way in giving our rural inhabitants the material means to prosperity and improvement.
Foremost of these is land.
During the last special session you enacted Republic Act No. 1400, known as the Land Tenure Reform Law. The Administration established by this law has taken the first steps to acquire landed estates for redistribution.
The NARRA continued to do a commendable job of resettling families in public lands. During the year 1955 it distributed homesteads to eight thousand eight hundred families in 22 settlement projects.[1] It is prepared henceforth to resettle at lest twelve thousand families a year. The flow of voluntary settlers in public lands also increased last year as a result of the accelerated surveys being undertaken by the Bureau of Lands.[2]But land alone is not enough. We are also building barrio roads[3]and irrigation systems[4]and placing agricultural experts at the service of our farmers and settlers. In this way they learn scientific agriculture, obtain indispensable water to expand the productivity of the land, and gain easy access to markets for their produce. At the same time new areas are opened up for cultivation.
The fast spreading ACCFA movement has continued to free more and more of our small farmers from exploitation.[5]ACCFA loans, which last year amounted to thirty-eight million four hundred thousand pesos,[6]have enabled FACOMA members to buy and own their carabaos[7]as well as farm equipment and supplies. Through the extension of FACOMA marketing facilities, small farmers are receiving more money for their products. The increase in the total income of farmers-members last year alone is estimated at more than eighty million pesos.
Definitely, the ACCFA points the way to rural stability and progress. We must continue to give it determined support.
The credit needs of our small farmers are being met from others sources.[8] Last year the Philippine National Bank, the RFC, and the rural banks extended loans to more farmer borrowers. It is, however, necessary to continue expanding credit for rural development.
The improvement of health in the rural areas is another tangible achievement. Many more towns and barrios are now assured of potable water from artesian wells[9]and water systems.[10]Mobile health units, now numbering over one thousand, performed more than ten million work units[11]in a three-month period of operation alone during 1955, providing medical services varying from simple consultations to child delivery and reaching places where no medical service had ever been available before. The complete eradication of malaria within the next three years is now within sight.
Comprehensive as are the material services and benefits extended to our rural inhabitants, this Administration has paralleled them with mental and spiritual stimulation. In this work we have made full use of education in all its aspects.
Barrio schools are increasing.[12] In them children are acquiring not only the basic tools of knowledge but also the skills of hand that can lead to a more abundant life.
Mainly to benefit rural children, who can afford no more than a few years of schooling, a revolutionary experiment is being introduced. Instead of English, the local dialects are now being used in the first two years of the elementary in many school divisions. Further result will, however, bear careful evaluation before the change may be universally adopted.
With encouragement from the Government, civic-spirited private organizations are helping to educate our people. Among these are the agricultural councils. The barrio assemblies, the 4-H clubs, and the purok associations.[13]
The establishment of barrio councils pursuant to Republic Act No. 1408 is another stride toward the strengthening of democracy at the grassroots. It is a good beginning but needs additional means of implementation to give it substance and practical effect. With these new organs of self-expression and self-government, our barrio people will display more initiative in improving their respective communities.
But unless Godliness and morality suffuse the outlook of our people, no objective achieved will be truly satisfying and enduring. We have therefore continued to emphasize the development of these attributes in the character of our youth as one of the fundamental objectives of our educational system.
While we have concentrated on rural development as our first and most important task, we have also endeavored to help the common man along other lines.
Under the Administration, labor has gained in stature with its greater participation in public affairs. In matters affecting labor itself, we have not hesitated to seek directly the counsel of its spokesmen, and its representatives now sit in the National Economic Council. The National Board of Education, the boards of various government corporations, and the Labor-Management Advisory Council of the Department of Labor.
The healthy growth of trade unions continues, while the workers’ increasing awareness of their rights and responsibilities is being matched by an expanding labor service on the part of the Government.[14]
The time has arrived for us to make a start on extending to labor the benefits of a social security system. However, we have had to delay the implementation of the Social Security Act because of our desire to assure the success of such a system by building it on a stable foundation rather than risk failure through a hasty start.
I recommend that the Congress give careful consideration to the review of the law, so that we may soon begin to establish a sound security system.
We have always recognized the necessity of providing low-cost housing for our working people. While financial difficulties have retarded our efforts to this end, we have embarked on various housing programs. The People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation is expanding low-rental housing for urban workers and the Home Financing Commission is ready to undertake aided self-help housing in the small communities, as well as private housing under a system of insured mortgages.[15]
Acknowledging their invaluable services to our people, we have provided for the adjustment of the salaries of the thousands of teachers who are themselves part of the low income group we seek to help, as well as active participants in the work of that group’s uplift.
Our Government’s deep concern for the common man is the logical first step toward imbuing the Filipino way of life with the true substance of democracy. Our people must be assisted to the richer rewards of effort but, at the same time, shown that those rewards are won through hard work and integrity. We must nurture in them self-respect, self-reliance, competence, and an ever awake social conscience-qualities that we must develop first of all at the base, as the foundation of the solidarity and greatness of our nation. In our striving for fulfillment as a people, we believe in working from the ground up—in the factories, in the sitios, in the barrios, in the towns of our rural areas—in the conviction that genuine democracy moves upward and not downward.
On the overall level, the national welfare has also advanced.
We have strengthened our friendship with other free countries. In the Bandung Conference, we forged closer ties with Asian and African nations and effectively collaborated with them in achieving unity. In the United Nations we secured Asian representation and membership in the Security Council, although incompletely, by splitting a two-year term with Yugoslovia. We have continued to promote international understanding through various international conferences, some of which were held in our country.
Continuing our fruitful collaboration with the United States, we have made good use of American economic aid in developing some of the activities I have already described. Under our mutual defense treaty with the United States and the Manila Pact, we have further strengthened the national security.
On the domestic front, peace and order are at their highest peak in postwar years. All but a few areas have been liberated from the terror of banditry and the Communist-led uprising.[16]However, against the backdrop of the new Communist diplomatic and economic offensive that has brought the “cold war” to a new crisis. Alien agents and saboteurs have attempted new and direct penetration and subversion. But, alert to their inroads, we have swiftly tracked them down and are prepared to meet every further outbreak of this new peril with vigor and firmness.
The year’s end witnessed an important turning point in our national economy. The era of free trade with the United States came to a close, and new graduated tariff duties were imposed on American imports. With this and other basic changes in our trade relations with the United States we can now lay the basis for a stable economy. It is now up to us to build that economy with determination and dedication.
The national production, estimated at eight billion eight hundred million pesos, increased by nearly four percent over that of last year. This was due to some progress in industrialization and a slight increase in agricultural production.[17] Large outlays for public works and development projects and additional public investments through government-owned corporations[18]made some contribution to the increase. Significant production gains have been made in some manufacturing lines.
I must state, however, that this increase in national production hardly evinces a balanced growth pattern. There is imperative need for the coordination and more vigorous implementation of the Government’s policies and the intensification of our efforts to stimulate production.
An integrated credit pattern is shaping up. The public and private banking institutions are gradually developing a balanced pattern of commercial, industrial, and agricultural loans. A good start has been made in giving special credit support to long-range development projects. The flow of credit should, however, be channeled so as to follow still more closely the main direction of our economic plans.
We have effected field surveys and investigation of our mineral deposits, the location of underground waters for both irrigation and potable water supply, and the survey and delineation of additional fishery areas and forest lands that may be made available for commercial exploitation. All these are intended to expand the utilization of our abundant natural resources. It is our hope that these resources surveys and investigations will make private enterprises fully aware of our potentialities and induce them to participate in our country’s development.
During the first ten months of the year 1955, rising local production, coupled with controls over non-essential imports, brought prices and the cost of living to record low levels since 1952.[19]However, mainly because of speculation in anticipation of new tariffs on American imports as well as the new tariff schedules and the expecting tightening of exchange controls, prices began to rise toward the end of the year and the trend still continues. The hoarding of imported stocks has become evident. It is equally evident that the rise in the prices of many articles of commerce, including basic necessities, not affected or only slightly affected by the new tariffs, is artificial and unjustified.
I recommend that the Congress consider means to prevent the spiraling of prices of essential commodities, either by a well-studied price control system or other effective measures. In the meanwhile, the Executive Department will use all the means at its command, including NAMARCO’s merchandising operations, to hold prices in line.
I would like to express here our appreciation of the cooperation that civic-spirited business organizations and individuals have preferred to the Government in this endeavor.
Another problem that looms large in our mind is unemployment. Its causes are numerous and complex, but this is not the occasion to consider them in detail.
Nevertheless, I take note of this serious problem to underscore its urgency and to emphasize upon all our people, particularly those in business and in the Government, the need for devoting all our energies, all our intelligence, all our zeal to the task of providing and creating opportunities for our people to make a decent living. The guideposts which I shall presently outline contain specific measures to meet this difficulty.
In brief outline, this is the record of the year past. It tells us that while something has been done. Our responsibility is not yet fully fulfilled. But this I know: We have hit our stride. We can and will succeed.
Our people have begun the peaceful revolution of uprooting age-old injustices and social evils and of elevating themselves to their true worth and dignity.
We must preserve and consolidate our gains and accelerate our forward pace.
I wish to emphasize that there is no change in our approach to the country’s problems. There is no departure from our basic economic objectives and policies which in past year I outlined to you.
So that our partnership in national duty and responsibility may produce increasing results, I invite you, as you perform your important share of our common task, to keep the following guideposts in view:
Our first guidepost is self-sufficiency in primary foodstuffs. 
Blessed with vast expanses of fertile land, we have the basic means to stop the recurring food shortages. We must attain self-sufficiency at least in the basic food.
Fortunately, we have succeeded in developing some effective incentives to production, such as the maintenance of floor prices in rice and corn and the expansion of credit and marketing facilities. We should now consider the feasibility of extending these incentives to other essential foods.
To sustain our gains, I have directed the NARIC, the ACCFA, and other agencies concerned to coordinate their efforts with the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources toward the early attainment of self-sufficiency in food.
Our second guidepost is the acceleration of land reform.
Because land ownership remains the greatest incentive to productivity and contentment among our masses, we are speeding up land distribution. The salutary impact of the Land Tenure Reform Act will soon be added to the efforts of the NARRA, the ACCFA, and the Bureau of Lands.
I invite the Congress to continue its interest in land reform and devise other means of further intensifying our efforts along this line.
Our third guidepost is the establishment of a strong administrative machinery for community development. 
As we diversify our efforts to stimulate community development, the establishment of a coordinating and implementing machinery becomes more urgent. I recommend that the Congress consider the creation of such an instrumentality to undertake this task.
I suggest that the Congress consider measures to make the local governments financially self-sufficient and more effective in community development. If deemed necessary, an organization should be created to undertake studies on this matter.
Our fourth guidepost is the fuller utilization of our natural resources in economic development. 
Our main hope of providing more employment to our people lies in the fuller utilization of our abundant natural resources. It is essential that existing as well as new industries make greater use of our available raw materials and develop those that can be produced locally. We should, therefore, give continued emphasis to industries and enterprises that will utilize more of our available materials and resources, as against those which are largely dependent on imported raw materials. Unless this is done, it will be well nigh impossible to build a sound economy.
To promote this objective, I recommend that the Congress provide funds for the continuance and expansion of our resources surveys and investigations.
Our fifth guidepost is the improvement of monetary and credit management to accelerate economic development. 
The expansion of credit facilities coupled with the proper allocation of foreign exchange is an effective stimulus to agricultural and industrial production. There should now be developed an integrated system of economic priorities to govern the extension of credit and the allocation of dollars. I have, therefore, directed the National Economic Council to develop such a system in concert with the Central Bank, giving preference to projects and enterprises which will make greater use of our available resources and which have high-income and employment potential.
I have directed the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation and the Central Bank to coordinate their activities and expedite the granting of loans and foreign exchange allocations to qualified agricultural and industrial enterprises.
I have also directed the Philippine National bank and, through the Central Bank, the rural banks all over the country to re-examine their lending operations with a view to giving greater support to small merchants and producers.
Our sixth guidepost is the adoption of educational reforms geared to the requirement of scientific and economic progress.
We must revitalize our educational system with emphasize on general, scientific, and vocational education.
The proposal to have an undersecretary for vocational education merits careful study. We should give full support to the improvement of instruction and facilities in public agricultural, trade, and technical schools.
The decreasing emphasis on the natural and physical sciences runs counter to the rapidly developing era of electronics and atomics. If we are to participate fully in the blessings of science, we must recast our educational system tot rain more engineers and scientists. As a beginning, mathematics and physics should again be taught as compulsory in high schools.
Our seventh guidepost is the need for scientific research as a basis of economic and social development. 
Fundamental and applied research has long been neglected. In science and scholarship we have largely depended on progress abroad. It is time that we participate seriously in this enterprise, paying particular attention to our needs.
As one of the first steps, I have created a Science Advisory Committee composed of representatives of the principal scientific organizations.
I urge the Congress to provide more funds for scientific research and investigation. I suggest that an appropriation be set aside for this purpose.
It would also be desirable to establish an Institute of Economic Development and Research in the University of the Philippines to provide not only our students but also those neighboring Asian countries with the advanced training essential to accelerated development.
We should provide inducements for private philanthropy for the benefit of scientific research. One way of doing this is to adopt a far-sighted tax policy in donations and grants for scientific research and investigation.
The eighth guidepost is the redefinition of the incentives for private enterprise.
The insufficiency and timidity of capital, domestic and foreign, has been one of the principal reasons for the delay in our economic development. We should now dissipate the uncertainty in our investment atmosphere and, consistent with the national interest, give to investors the necessary incentives and guarantees.
I trust that the Congress will enact in this session legislation fully meeting this problem.
It is part of our efforts to clarify the goals of our economic growth and the means with which we seek to attain them. Among them ate the economic controls. While we are for their gradual removal, they remain necessary at this stage of our economic development. They must be utilized to assure the most advantageous allocation of our limited resources and thus maintain monetary and price stability.
Improvements must be effected in the implementation of controls. But sudden policy changes which tend to dislocate business should be avoided.
I urge the Congress to consider amendments to the Central Bank Charter which would render the Monetary Board more effective in the administration of exchange and the management of money and credit.
In this connection, I would urge that at least three of the members of the Monetary Board serve on a full time basis.
The Central Bank Charter should be amended further to provide for a more liberal rediscounting system so as to enlarge the lending operations of our banks.
We should re-examine the no-dollar import law, define its objectives and scope, and examine its performance in the light of experience to date.
Our tariff structure should be further studied to give full protection to our vital industries. It would also be advisable to renew the authority granted to the President under Republic Act No. 1196 to increase or reduce tariff rates for at least two more years.
Our ninth guidepost is the stabilization of the fiscal position of the Government. 
At the bottom of our slow progress in some areas of public service is the insufficiency of public revenues. I therefore urge the Congress to study the following aspects of our fiscal organization with a view to increasing government revenues:
First, the necessity of setting up a tax commission to undertake technical studies of our tax system and recommend improvements;
Second, the further raising of the efficiency of our revenue collecting agencies; and,
Third, the revision of our tax laws where such revisions are deemed urgent, pending the studies by the tax commission.
I shall presently submit to you a report which the Tax Advisory Board has just completed for your consideration.
Our tenth guidepost is the need for raising efficiency in public administration.
The implementation of sound and well-planned projects often bogs down owing to inefficiency in public administration. We must, therefore, continue to buttress our administrative units, especially those directly concerned with economic development.
We have completed the wage and position classification survey and a project on the improvement of budgeting, accounting, and auditing procedures in the Government. We should now apply the results of these studies to effect economy and efficiency.
Our initial experience in performance budgeting in twelve government bureaus has produced beneficial results. We should now extend it to more government agencies.
The most inspiring laws and the best-conceived plans of implementing them are often frustrated by administrative inertia and incompetence.
Realizing this I have created a Presidential Performance Commission and entrusted it with the duty of keeping close watch on performance and result in the executive agencies and instrumentalities of the Government. Energetic, intelligent, and dedicated service at every level is indispensable to the success of Government.
I commend these guideposts to your thoughtful consideration in the full confidence that they will give our joint efforts a common unswerving direction.
In our task, I call upon our people to continue giving us their earnest support. This is their share of responsibility implicit in their twice-entrusted mandate under which we assumed the nation’s leadership.
Our times demand selflessness and self-sacrifice. The insincere, the dishonest, the selfish, the greedy, the laggard have no place.
With God continuing His kind blessings upon us, we shall not be found wanting.

Address
of
His Excellency Ramon Magsaysay
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Released on January 28, 1957]
MR. PRESIDENT, MR. SPEAKER, MEMBERS OF CONGRESS:
Three years ago, as partners under the Constitution, we started on our mission of serving the people. As we enter upon our fourth year, it is timely that we review the results of our endeavors. Thus we may gain the proper perspective from which to view the work still undone.
When we started on this mission, we set for ourselves four main objectives:
(1) To safeguard the security of the nation;
(2) To promote the moral and material well-being of our masses;
(3) To develop and stabilize the national economy; and
(4) To improve the standards of public service.
How much has been done towards these objectives? How much more is to be done?
THE SECURITY OF THE NATION
Our first main objective has been the promotion of national security. This is in accordance with the constitutional mandate that the defense of the State is the prime duty of Government. To accomplish this end, we have proceeded on the basic premise that freedom is indivisible. We are secure in our freedom only as the world around is secure. Our efforts towards attaining our own security must, therefore, embrace the larger objective of contributing, however modestly, to the promotion of the peace and freedom of the world.
PEACE THROUGH U.N.
Accordingly, next only to our faith in the justice and mercy of God, we have placed our primary hopes for the attainment of this objective in the United Nations. With our recent election to the Security Council of the United Nations, an aspiration of the Philippine Government since 1951, we have gained an opportunity to participate more fully in the task of preserving international tranquility.
Within the framework of the United Nations Charter, we have pressed for the self-determination of subject peoples. We were active in helping to bring about the approval of the cease-fire resolution in the Israel-Egyptian crisis. We aligned ourselves forthrightly with the countries that con­demned Soviet aggression in Hungary.
Pursuant to the same Charter, we have entered into regional and bilateral arrangements for our defense. Developments indicate that the Manila Pact, which we signed in September, 1954, has been one of the effective factors in deterring Communist aggression in Southeast Asia. In keeping with our treaty obligations, we have intensified our participation in the planning and activities of SEATO. It is to the interest of national security that we insure our ability to participate even more actively in this organization.
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS WITH U.S.
Parallel to this multi-lateral agreement, we continue to bolster our external defense through our mutual security arrangements with the United States of America. Such close relations as those which have resulted from these arrangements have naturally produced varied problems, Some of these we have solved—such as the question of the ownership of the base lands. Other problems, such as those discussed by our panel in the military bases talks, will require further negotiation. I am confident that the friendship which underlies the relations between our two countries will yield solutions consistent with our national dignity and security.
RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
In a very real sense, international understanding strength­ens peace. With this objective in mind, we took steps to come closer to other countries of the free world, particularly those of Asia and Africa. To the allies that we had gained in SEATO, we added the new friends we made through participation in the Asian-African Conference of 1955. We resolved the Japanese reparations issue, ended the state of war with Japan, and established diplomatic relations with her.[1] We recognized and exchanged diplo­matic representatives with various new Asian and African states and effected the long neglected diplomatic exchange with Burma.[2] We have also accredited a resident minister to the Federal Republic of Germany. Cultural and technical exchanges between the Philippines and other countries, especially in Asia, have never been as extensive as in the past three years.[3]
INTERNAL SECURITY
Our internal security has consistently improved. Our Armed Forces, having broken the back of the Communist armed rebellion, continue to seek out and destroy dissident remnants.
However, our military success has caused the Communists, abetted by foreign agents, to concentrate on the subversive phase of their movement. Their objective to overthrow the Government remains. But they would now achieve this principally by means other than force—by infiltrating the Government and private organizations, by seeking the legalization of their political activities, and by prostituting the democratic process—although this new strategy could at any time shift once again to armed rebellion.
To check this subversion and prevent the resurgence of armed dissidence, as well as to enable the Armed Forces to discharge their responsibility in the maintenance of our external security, we must keep them in a state of adequacy and preparedness.
CAFA RECOMMENDATIONS
The House Committee on Anti-Filipino Activities has recently made public a timely report on how best to meet this new direction in Communist tactics. Two of its recommendations, namely, the outlawing of the Communist Party and the amendment of the law on treason so as to make it applicable even when actual international hostilities do not exist would require specific legislative measures for their implementation. It is well that a Committee of this Congress has recognized the need of giving the Government the legal strength with which to anticipate and frustrate the Communists in their new approach. I would ask your action on such legislation.
These policies to safeguard the security of the nation have brought about the necessary climate tranquility and order for the effective pursuit of our other objectives.
THE WELL-BEING OF THE MASSES
We have pressed our program of social justice.
From the outset of our administration, we have emphasized the need for reforms and improvements in our land tenure system. Similarly, we have stressed the urgency of promoting the development of our rural communities.
LAND REFORMS
Through tenancy and land reform measures, we have improved the living conditions of our tenants and farmers. More than that, these new measures have opened up the path to land ownership. But ownership alone will not ensure to the small farmer the full enjoyment of his land. For this, it is necessary that he should operate his farm efficiently. We have, therefore, redoubled our efforts in assisting him to become an efficient farmer.
Since 1954, we have vigorously campaigned against the exploitation of tenants by their landlords. We are succeeding. We have helped the tenants secure a greater share of the fruits of their labors. Last year, the Court of Agrarian Relations was established. Within the brief period of its existence, this Court has shown its effectiveness in the settlement of tenancy disputes. This is a fresh advance towards agrarian peace.
The rate of land resettlement and land purchase for redistribution has not reached our expectations. It must be accelerated. But in another phase of land tenure improvement—the issuance of land patents—we have made unprecedented progress. The Bureau of Lands in the last three years granted a total of 124,200 land patents to qualified settlers.[4]
This figure is more than five times the total number of land patents issued during the period from 946 to 1953. This fact not only reflects our intensified efforts in public land distribution but also attests to a significant advance in land reform. It means that we are setting up thousands of small independent farmers on land of their own, with the opportunity to work out a decent living for themselves and their families.
THE COOPERATIVE MOVEMENT
Two principal factors have contributed to the moral and material uplift of the people in our rural areas; namely, the rapid organization and dynamic operation of the farmers’ cooperatives and the speedy implementation of the rural health program. ACCFA has organized a total of 416 farmers’ cooperative marketing associations (FACOMAs) with paid-up capital of nearly P5 million. In 1953, marketing cooperatives with 6,643 members operated in 110 barrios. Today, these cooperatives exist in 10,314 barrios in 47 provinces, with a total membership pf 241,000.
These farmers’ cooperatives, with the support of ACCFA, have granted their members loans amounting to P98 million. In addition, the 68 rural banks now in existence, under a liberal Government policy, have extended loans to small farmers and tenants amounting to P26 million. Never before have our small farmers and tenants been afforded so much cheap credit, freeing them from the evils of usury and helping them to improve their lot.
We should now extend the proven benefits of cooperative organization throughout the country. We should carry the cooperative spirit not only to all the barrios but also to the towns and cities, by stimulating the establishment of credit unions, consumers’ cooperatives, and wholesale cooperative associations. In support of this program, we are giving earnest consideration to the advisability of establishing a bank for cooperatives.
The improvement in agricultural production[5] and the general confidence among the rural people in the various measures introduced for their benefit are due in large measure to the agricultural extension workers and other technicians in the field. The teachers and school administrators connected with the community schools, the purok organizations, and the community development officers are equally effective in helping our communities make fuller use of their own capabilities and resources.
PUBLIC HEALTH
The people, whose welfare is the reason for the existence of the State, is also its most important resource. To promote this welfare and to sustain this resource, we have greatly expanded our health programs, especially where it is most needed—in the rural areas.
When we started in 1954, there were 81 rural health units. Today they number 1,100.[6] Indicating its great expansion, the public health service now covers 1,280 of the 1,300 municipalities in the country.
We have greatly increased public medical and hospital facilities.[7] Yet, much more is needed to meet the increasing needs of our people. We must continue to prosecute our public health program with vigor.
ROADS, IRRIGATION, WELLS
As an added measure of social amelioration, we have pushed forward an extensive program for the construction of roads, irrigation systems, and artesian wells.
During the last three years, we constructed and improved 5,273 kilometers of roads at a total cost of P153.5 million. We built 4,372 kilometers of graded roads for the small towns and barrios, at a total cost of P28.2 million. We completed five irrigation systems,[8] servicing 25,400 hectares, at a cost of P11.2 million and 95 communal irrigation projects, serving 43,000 hectares, at a cost of P127 million. We installed 188 irrigation pumps servicing 31,000 hectares. We drilled 5,885 artesian wells and completed communal water systems and spring improvements.
Under construction starting last year are 33 gravity irrigation systems covering an irrigable area of 152,250 hectares of an estimated cost of P94,645,100. This irrigable area is greater than the area irrigated by all the irrigation systems constructed by the Government from 1907 to 1953.
In addition to this, the Bureau of Public Works has programmed for 1957 to 1960 the construction of irrigation systems covering 244,100 hectares at an estimated cost of P147,000,000. This will bring the total irrigation area to 556,939 hectares, which is about five times that irrigated by the systems constructed from 1907 to 1953.
LABOR
Substantial gains have also been in the field of labor. We have encouraged the growth of strong and democratic unions. For every worker who held a union card at the beginning of our administration, there are now three. The number of registered labor unions reached a total of 2,216 in 1956, representing an increase of nearly 300 per cent over of that 1954.
We have given vitality to the Magna Charta of labor and other labor laws.[9] Collective bargaining has gained general acceptance. The Government has promoted regional labor-management conferences that have strengthened the basis of individual peace. Today Philippine labor enjoys greater security ever before.
PUBLIC EDUCATION
The advances made in public education are no less significant. We have continued to give support and encouragement to the education of our youth, particularly in the remote communities. The increase in the number of schools and school teachers during the last three years has been considerable. We now have 104,250 teachers, compared with 91,665 three years ago. From 23,600 public schools in 1953, the number has increased to 26,370 in 1956. Our pre-fabricated school building program has assisted in providing during the last two years additional schoolhouses for the barrios.[10]
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE
The promotion of the well-being of our masses, through the measures I have described, has given them opportunities for a richer and fuller life[11] which they have never enjoyed in our history. It has restored their faith in Government as an instrument for the political, economic, and social advancement of all the people, not of just a privileged few. Today the common people know and feel that they have a Government they can depend upon to protect their rights and promote their interests. In this way they have acquired a real stake in the preservation of our democratic way of life, and will not be easy prey to the deceptive promises of a false ideology.
All the people are the richer because of this. It is error to think we can ever achieve economic development and progress as long as the majority of our people live in substandard conditions. They would always be a drag on the entire nation. Their well-being is the solid foundation for real progress in economic development.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
Our primary economic goal has been to strengthen and broaden the base of our economic activities. For unless a greater number of our people are engaged in productive enterprises sufficiently diversified to supply our basic necessities, increase the opportunities for employment, and raise the income of our workers, our economic structure will be weak and lopsided.
We will reach this goal by a balanced agricultural and industrial development. Thus we must continue to work towards reshaping our economic structure with the industrial side accounting for a rising proportion of our total output in the years ahead. We must foster an economy in which industrial expansion and agricultural progress are complementary. Industry can draw its raw materials from agriculture; in turn, as our farmers increase their income, the products of industry will have an expanding domestic market. In this way, there will be formed a partnership of enduring strength and a sound pattern for unlimited growth.
We are moving towards this goal.
INCREASED PRODUCTION
The volume of national production has increased. In 1956, the total volume of farm, forest, mineral, and manufacturing production was higher by 30 per cent than that of 1953.[12] Farm and forest production rose by 26 per cent; mineral production, by 11 ½ per cent. The output of our manufacturing industries registered a gain of 38 per cent, the highest made in any sector of the economy.
This rise in overall production is reflected in the national income. In 1953 the national income was 7 billion, 234 million pesos. In 1955, this went up to 7 billion, 804 million pesos, showing an increase of P570 million.
As I have stated, it was in the manufacturing sector of our economy where the greatest advance was attained. Thus, in 1956 alone, 175 manufacturing concerns qualified as new and necessary industries. We now have a total of 719 concerns which are engaged in new and essential industrial activities. Their total investment has now reached Php396 million.
The rapid progress attained in manufacturing may be gauged by considering the variety of consumer products which are now manufactured locally and are beginning to meet demands of domestic consumption. Such items as wearing apparel, footwear, cigarettes, school and office supplies, building and electrical materials, tires, and certain food products—all of which we used to import—are now being supplied from Philippine manufactures.
This growth in manufacturing production is partly due to the application of exchange and import controls. we have permitted the increased importation of machinery and raw materials for new essential industries without necessarily sacrificing the importation of an adequate amount of essential consumer items. It was due to this policy that our international reserves went down from $305 million in 1953 to $209 million in 1955. However, at the end of 1956, by the judicious application of exchange and import controls, our international reserves rose to $226 million.
POWER DEVELOPMENT
It is recognized that power is a basic requirement for our industrialization. We have thus stepped up power development, the cheapest source of which in our country is water power. During the past three years, we continued the construction of the Ambuklao Hydro-electric Project on the Agno River, begun under the previous administration. The work was completed last month and the plant was put in service to furnish 75,000 kilowatts to the people of Northern and Central Luzon and Manila. We completed other projects started under our administration, with a total capacity of 26,200 kilowatts—the Maria Cristina No.2 Unit in Lanao, the Amburayan Chute Project in La Union, the Peñaranda Chute Project. in Nueva Ecija, the Digos River and Talomo No. 2-B projects in Davao, and the Balombong .River Project in Catanduanes.
We now have under construction, to be completed this year, the Loboc River Project in Bohol, the Agusan River Project in Bukidnon, and the Barit River Project in Camarines Sur, with a total capacity of 4,200 kilowatts. We have begun the construction of the. Biñga Project on the Agno River with a capacity of 100,000 kilowatts.
Other projects, principally the Marikina Mu1ti Purpose Project with 60.000 kilowatts, the Maria Cristina No.3 Unit with 50,000 kilowatts, and the Bubonawan Project with 10,000 kilowatts will be started this year. All these, together with thermal and diesel-electric plants installed by private utility operators, will provide our people with the necessary power to turn the wheels of industry .and :with conveniences to make their homes more livable.
METALLURGICAL INDUSTRY
To lay the basis for the development of a metallurgical industry, the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASSCO) is now establishing, the first pig-iron smelting plants in the country. These plants will process iron ore coming from our own mines into pig-iron which, in turn, will be used by existing steel mills. NASSCO will also establish rolling mills for steel plates and sheets which will be used in shipyards and other fabricating shops.
When all these plants are in operation within approx­imately two years, we shall have gone a long way towards supplying our needs for iron and steel from our own resources.
Complementary to the steps towards the development of the metallurgical industry, the Government should give impetus to further mineral exploitation, particularly of iron and other base metals. The large nickel-iron reserves in Nonoc Island, Surigao, which is now within a government reservation, should be opened for development. I recommend that Congress enact appropriate legislation on the matter.
The expansion of the economy, particularly in the in­dustrial sector, results in the growth of urban communities and increases effective demand for domestic production. It also gives rise to a variety of new occupations, especially in supplementary industries and distributive trades. All this means increasing opportunities for employment of our labor force.
GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS
With respect to the Government’s participation in business, I would like to state once more our policy . The Government should limit such participation only to cases where reasons of national interest require it, or when such participation is desirable in order to stimulate private investment in a particular field.
In line with this policy, the Government has disposed, is prepared to dispose, of its enterprises[13] which do not fulfill either of the purposes stated, subject, of course, to proper safeguards for the public interest.
ECONOMIC PLANNING
In the achievement of these results, our effort has been guided in the main by the economic plan adopted at the start of our administration, which I announced on March 20, 1954.[14] As I stated more than once, the plan was not inflexible but was to be updated periodically on the basis of past performance, changing, conditions, and prospects of further advance.
In my state-of-the-nation message in 1954, I stressed the necessity of revitalizing the National Economic Council. To this end, Government Reorganization Plan No. 10 was approved in July, 1955, thus creating the machinery for the revision of the 1954 economic plan.
In the meanwhile, the end of free trade with the United States in 1955 and the then impending reparations agreement with Japan made it imperative that the newly reorganized Council begin the task of revision. Consequently, in September, 1955, I requested the National Economic Council to undertake the task. It soon became evident, however, that there were trends in the Council not in harmony with our fiscal policies. I reiterated these policies in my budget message to the Congress on February 6, 1956, which contained a comprehensive fiscal plan embodying an investment program and priorities in consonance with the 1954 economic plan.
Despite this, the trends continued. As a consequence, changes came about in the Council’s membership in March, 1956. It was then that the NEC was able to proceed with its work consistently with our economic program.
On January 3, 1957, the National Economic Council submitted its recommendations for updating the 1954 economic development program. These recommendations included a system of industrial priorities to govern the allocation of foreign exchange, the administration of the Government’s fiscal operations, and the extension of credit. We have adopted this industrial priority system as a guide in the implementation of projects which will make the maximum contribution to production, employment, and income.
As the implementing arm of the Government to carry out its part, pursuant to the economic program, a national, development authority charged with this function and with the supervision of government corporations is definitely needed. I, therefore, recommend the enactment of a law creating such an authority.
FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICIES
From the beginning, we have adhered to the principle, of promoting economic development without impairing monetary stability. We have, therefore implemented and coordinated our fiscal, monetary, and exchange control policies as instruments of development in accordance with this principle.
The annual fiscal budgets of the Government have given emphasis to public spending for economic development[15]. purposes. Total expenditures for economic development since 1954 have amounted to 1 billion, 39 million pesos, having risen from P151 million in 1953 to P440 million in 1956.
The significant record of production over the last few years was supported by a credit policy which continued to emphasize liberal assistance to projects whose contribution to the national income and to economic development was deemed high. More credits for socially desirable projects were made available by the increased number of branches and agencies of domestic financial institutions and the creation of more cooperatives and rural banks.
The total outstanding credit of all financial institutions reached 2 billion, 827 million pesos by the end of 1956, representing an increase of more than 1 billion, 58 million pesos since 1953.[16] During the same period, the share of agri­culture and manufacturing in total bank credits increased substantially and the share of commerce and real estate correspondingly declined. This favorable shift in the pat­tern of distribution of bank credits indicates the effective­ness of our credit policies.
CONTROLLING INFLATIONARY PRESSURES
The high level of Government spending for development and the expansion of credit obviously carry with them inflationary tendencies which affect monetary stability. Rising prices and other inflationary pressures in the principal industrial countries have added to these tendencies. We have managed our fiscal and monetary policies in such a way as to minimize the adverse effects of these pressures on internal and external stability. These policies and the accompanying increase in local production have kept these inflationary trends under control.
To insure a more effective distribution of public funds among essential and strategic development projects, the Budget commission has prepared a five-year program of public investment. In coordination with this program, the Central Bank has formulated a five-year foreign exchange budget designed to meet the most important requirements of both private and public investments for foreign exchange
The close coordination now existing between the fiscal and the monetary authorities is an assurance that the five year fiscal budget and the five-year foreign exchange budget will be carefully and properly implemented.
CHECKING RISING PRICES
We are still faced with the problem of avoiding, in the months ahead, any marked increase in prices and in the cost of living arising from Government spending for development, as well as from inflationary trends abroad and the consequent heavy pressure on our international reserves.
To meet this problem, we will continue to adjust our foreign exchange allocations to the demand for essential consumer goods without impairing the requirements of high priority project. We will also keep our public borrowing through bond issue under constant review in order that any undue pressure on the reserves may be avoided.
I realize that the success of all these policies and the effective use of all these instruments will depend on the extent to which the Government can create a climate that will encourage private investments. An important element of this climate is the structure of tariff rates. Our present tariff rates, however, are not adequate to serve the purpose of economic development. I urge, therefore, that Congress give priority to this matter.
JAPANESE REPARATIONS
There is, finally, one aspect of our foreign exchange resources which requires our immediate attention—the need for properly directing the distribution and utilization of the goods and services from Japanese reparations. As part of our foreign exchange resources, these reparations payments will have to be synchronized and integrated with the allocation of all available financial resources of our country. Legislative authority is also necessary for a permanent office which would budget our requirements, supervise deliveries, and oversee the proper utilization and distribution of reparations goods and services in accordance with definite criteria.
ECONOMIC STABILITY
While we are engaged in the vital tasks of economic development, the Government must avoid unsound and dangerous policies which would nullify our gains.
There has been some agitation for the immediate and total removal of economic controls. As an ideal goal, an economy free from Government control is of course to be desired. However, under prevailing world conditions and in our present state of economic growth, the continuation of economic controls is a necessity. I would like to reiterate the view which I expressed on March 11, 1956, before the first Trade National Convention[17] that a system of exchange and import controls is still a necessary instrument today if we are to meet the requirements of our development projects and at the same time maintain the inflow of essential consumer goods not locally available.
Our recent experience has confirmed the correctness of this view. In 1955, our international trade was greatly unbalanced. But, by the improved application of import and exchange controls, coupled with the growth of new and essential industries, we were able to reduce our trade deficit and achieved a favorable balance of payments position at the end of 1956.[18]
Through the same means, we have been able to provide for the increased importation of machinery and raw materials and for the increased inflow of essential consumer goods to prevent any disrupting rise in domestic prices. This was done, on the one hand, by reducing further our non-essential imports and, on the other, by permitting the importation of an adequate amount of essential consumer goods. In this way, through exchange and import controls, we have been able to meet both the requirements of our growing industry and the basic needs of our people without impairing the stability of our currency.
NO DOLLAR IMPORT LAW
In connection with our policy on exchange control, there is one aspect which I believe we should immediately re-examine. I refer to Republic Act No. 1410, otherwise known as the no-dollar import law. I entertained some appre­hension about the wisdom of this legislation at the time it was presented to me for approval. But I thought we should give it a trial and so allowed the ·bill to become a law without my signature. However, the general effects of transactions authorized under this law have been found to be inconsistent with the objectives of exchange and im­port controls and may endanger the stability of our currency. I, therefore, urge the Congress to give this matter its immediate consideration.
We must be wary of measures which would have disas­trous effects on our economy. I am particularly concerned about any move that would bring economic difficulties to our average citizen. In countries with which we trade, inflation and other economic problems are being aggravated by the situation in the Middle East. The impact of such developments on our economy is inevitable. We cannot afford to create more problems in our country. Progress is possible only in an environment of economic stability.
These are the steps which we have taken towards national security, rural uplift, and economic development. In the pursuit of these objectives, it is essential that the Government be so organized and operated that it may serve as an effective instrument for their attainment.
IMPROVEMENT OF STANDARDS IN PUBLIC SERVICE
The prime function of government is service to the people. It exists to protect their rights. It has been our policy that the Government shall not only respect the people’s right but shall actively encourage their exercise.
To give meaning and substance to this positive approach to human rights, we established in 1954 the Presidential Complaints and Action Committee (PCAC). The enthu­siasm which met the creation of this Committee continues undiminished. It is one more reason why the people feel so strongly that the Government is truly theirs.
There is still another beneficial result. Its creation has had a salutary influence on the public service. By acting as a readily accessible agency for receiving complaints, the PCAC has served to deter official wrongdoing. Thus, it has helped us to carry out our pledge of morality and honesty in the public service.
We have not relaxed vigilance against misconduct in office. Public office is a stern task-master, and among its exacting requirements is that a public servant must not only be blameless, but above suspicion. Accordingly, complaints against official wrongdoing have been promptly investigated and, where justifies, the respondents have been dealt with in accordance with due process of law. There shall be no compromise with this resolve to maintain the highest standards of honesty and morality in the Government.
EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT
In order to discharge its mission, the public service must be possessed of still another essential attribute-efficiency. To bring this about, we have found it necessary to con­sider a general reorganization of the various agencies of the government. Our efforts in this direction have resulted in comprehensive, scientific, and functional reorganization plans, some of which have already been duly implemented.
Government service is only as efficient as the individual public servant is efficient. The public servant must, therefore, be provided with the necessary incentives to work efficiently and with the recognition that his efforts deserve. One of these incentives is adequate compensation. It is our resolve that this demand be satisfied within the limits of our financial resources. To this end, we are now pre­paring for partial implementation of the plans formulated by the Wage and Position Classification Office (WAP­CO), which would standardize government positions and provide for equitable compensation for services rendered. The budget which I shall submit to you next month will include this proposal.
LOCAL AUTONOMY
To give more appropriate expression to the popular will, we believe that we should give greater stress to local auto­nomy. In the daily lives of our people, the provincial city, municipal, and barrio agencies are the effective contacts between the citizen and his government. Further­more, they are relied upon for the dissemination and execution of national policies.
In order to enable us to pay closer attention to the needs of local governments, I recommend the restoration of the Department of Interior. We are now considering specific proposals on this subject for your future action.
CONCLUSION
Members of the Congress: thus far we have gone in the past three years. We have provided for the national security, both within and without. Our masses, the vital object of our joint concern, have received priority in our efforts. Their well-being is para­mount.
We have made progress in the economic sphere.
We have worked hard to assure that our Government continue to protect the liberty and dignity of the individual. We have discharged the positive duty incumbent on gov­ernment of insuring the enjoyment of social and economic rights under the more complex conditions of this age.
Yet, much remains to be done.
We must continue our vigilance. Communism, with its ever-shifting tactics, remains a threat.
We cannot afford to falter in our social justice program. The masses of our people, the base of our democracy, will continue to be the beneficiaries of our special concern.
We must accelerate the pace of economic progress. Mindful of our duty to our people and determined in our goals, we must surpass our accomplishments of the past three years with a renewed dedication to the public welfare.
May God continue to guide us in the service of our people.
I thank you.

[1] Other important international agreements entered into besides the Manila Pact, the revision of the Bell Act, and the Japanese Reparations agreement were: (1) Protocol on Trade Relations between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Egypt, signed at Washington, January 18, 1955 (2) Exchanges of Notes extending the barter agreement between the Philippines and Japan; (3) Agreement concerning Migration of Filipino Labor for Employment in British North Borneo, signed at Manila on August 30, 1956; (4) Agreement for Cooperation between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Government of the United States of America concerning civil uses of atomic energy, signed at Washington on July 27, 1955.
[2] The Philippines recognized the States of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in 1955, and Morocco, Tunisia, and Sudan in 1956. This year we will exchange diplomatic representatives with Egypt, where we established a consulate last year. Likewise we will establish diplomatic relations with Israel and are now negotiating diplomatic exchanges with Ceylon and Iraq.
[3] The Department of Foreign Affairs sponsored the organization of the Cultural Foundation of the Philippines which, with private support, has begun a program of cultural exchange, especially with Asian countries. The Foundation has brought to the Philippines cultural groups from India and Indonesia and has sponsored a Philippine cultural mission to Taipeh. This year it expects to send a Philippine cultural group to other parts of Southeast Asia.
The Philippines availed itself of over 80 scholarships offered by different Asian countries under various cultural exchange programs. On the other hand, there has been an increased number of scholars and students from Southeast Asia who have come to the Philippines. This program of cultural exchange is conducted under the Cultural Division of the Department of Foreign Affairs with the cooperation of other official and private agencies.
[4] These cover 650,000 hectares of agricultural lands.
[5] Total agricultural production increased from 8,150,800 metric tons in 1953 to 9,049,500 tons in 1956, or by 11 per cent. Food crops increased by 8.8 per cent, from 5,781,200 tons in 1953 to 6,289,000 tons in 1956. Commercial or export crops increased by 16.5 per cent, from 2,369,600 tons in 1953 to 2,760,500 tons in 1956.
[6] This number includes 801 completely staffed units, 233 incomplete units, and 66 junior units. A complete unit consists of a health officer, a nurse, a midwife, and a sanitary inspector. A junior unit is composed of two persons.
[7] We have increased the number of government hospital beds from 7,475 in 1954 to 10,050; the number of doctors in these hospitals, from 342 to 629; nurses, from 770 to 1,651; and those in the technical staffs, from 426 to 715. Likewise, the number of government physicians in the field has increased from 439 in 1953 to 1,134 in 1956.
[8] Under construction are 23 gravity irrigation systems to irrigate a total area of 124,800 hectares.
[9] Through the Department of Labor and its 52 regional offices, laborers’ claims have been more effectively enforced. Over the last three years nearly P3,000,000 was collected in wage restitutions.
[10] Of the 3,720 room units completed in 1956 by the Armed Forces, 1,593 have been erected in the different barrios. The rest are either in transit or in the process of erection. The number of room units constructed this year is almost three times that in 1950.
[11] On another front of socio-economic amelioration, low-cost housing, the People’s Homesite and Housing Corporation last year neared completion of Project 6 and 7 and started Project 8 near Manila, and broke ground for low-cost housing projects in Tagaytay, Cebu, and Tacloban. We have also relaxed the terms for acquisition of PHHC low-cost houses to encourage home ownership by low-income groups

[16] The total outstanding domestic credit of the Central Bank, other banks and selected financial institutions from December, 1953, to October, 1956, increased from P1,768,1000,000 to P2,826,8000,000 or 59.9 per cent. Of the total credits outstanding on October 31, 1956, P339,7000,000 are of the Central Bank; P1,644,200,000 are of commercial banks; P788,900,000 are of selected financial institutions consisting of the RFC, GSIS, ACCFA, rural banks, pawnshops, and building and loan associations.
[17] “We cannot hope to diversify our production end industrialize our econ­omy without providing an increased amount of foreign exchange with which to purchase essential producers goods from abroad for our economic development. In brief, to achieve our goal of greater self-sufficiency for home consumption and to minimize our present dependence on imports, we must purchase abroad the machinery, equipment, and materials which will permit us to activate new industries. In this process our foreign exchange control system is of vital importance.
“As our industrialization efforts become successful in the next few years and as our economy develops sufficiently to supply the home markets, we will become less and less dependent on this type of control as an artificial method of achieving our goals. But at the present time the judicious and controlled use of our foreign exchange is essential in order to give us access abroad to producers goods for major economic development projects. Only” when a natural balance of imports and exports is reached can. we abandon our present system, perhaps coming to rely then on tariff measures for controls still needed.”
[18] Substantial progress was made in spreading our foreign trade to other areas. Our total trade with Northwest Europe in the first eight months of last year was 42.3 per cent above the corresponding period the year previous, and our total trade with Asia was up 13.5 per cent. For the first time since 1919, the United States in the first eight months of 1956 accounted for less than 60 percent of our total trade.

Message
of
His Excellency Diosdado Macapagal
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Delivered on January 22, 1962]
“Five-Year Integrated Socio-Economic Program for the Philippines”
Mr.  Vice President,
Mr. President,
Mr. Speaker,
Monsignor Antiporda,
Ladies and gentlemen of the Congress;
I appear before you today, the elected representatives of the sovereign people, not as President of one party but as President of the entire Nation.
As such, I am charged with the constitutional duty, which I am resolved to carry out, of serving the interests of the members of all groups of our people and doing justice to every man.
It is in this spirit that I now come before you. For in administering the affairs of this nation, you and I share the common responsibility of providing the leadership, the guidance and the service that a democratic government owes to the people. You and I must provide for their enjoyment of those basic requisites for decent living and of those adequate opportunities for the attainment of material prosperity and spiritual fulfillment. Only thus will they be able to stand in dignity and freedom in the community of nations.
We assume our joint responsibilities at a time when the Nation is faced with many serious problems. The eyes of the world are focused on us, anxious to see how this new Government will face the difficulties confronting it. Our performance will be judged not only by our own people but also by the other nations of the world, not only by the present but also by posterity.
Because of the impelling and serious problems facing the country today, I should like to depart from the tradi­tional practice of my illustrious predecessors of delivering an all-embracing State of the Nation message. I shall not burden you now with all the details usually embodied in such a message, especially those related to the customary and routinary activities of the government. While it is recognized that such functions deserve equal and proper attention, I believe it would be more in keeping with the exigencies of the moment to submit, at the proper time and in the hour of need, such special messages to Congress on these matters as may be warranted by circumstances.
In the interest of priority of purpose, therefore, I beg leave to submit for the consideration of this Congress only the most paramount problems of the Nation which, in my considered opinion, require immediate and preferential attention.
STATEMENT OF OUR MISSION
In my inaugural address, I set forth the goals of our Administration in the coming years, as follows—
1. The solution of the problem of corruption;
2. The attainment of self-sufficiency in the staple food of our people, namely, rice and corn;
3. The creation of conditions that will provide more income to our people—income for those who have none and more income for those whose earnings are inadequate for their elemental needs;
4. The establishment of practices that will strengthen the moral fiber of our nation and reintroduce those values that would invigorate our democracy; and
5. The launching of a bold but well-formulated socio-economic program that shall place the country on the road to prosperity for all our people.
This five-fold mission may be carried out by resolving two major problems, namely—the need for moral regener­ation and the problem of economic growth.
Democracy on Trial
In the accomplishment of our mission, we have chosen the freedom of democracy as the context for the solution of our problems. Democracy is truly on trial along with us in our social and economic travails.
By our success or failure in leading the Nation from the abyss of want to the plateau of abundance, not only ourselves but also our way of life will be judged. If we falter, we shall fail democracy as well as our people and thus bolster communism’s boast that it is a superior political system. But if we succeed in laying a dynamic and per­manent base for justice and prosperity in this country, we shall vindicate not only ourselves but democracy itself.
MORAL REGENERATION
Therefore, I first invite your attention to the decadent state of our public morality. Our efforts to achieve the goal of economic and social fulfillment will be more effective and the results we obtain more permanent only if we can suffuse them with a pervasive moral regeneration.
At my inauguration, I stated that I would seek to strengthen the nation’s moral fiber through formal modes of reform, enforcement of the laws and the exercise of the tremendous persuasive power of the Presidency in setting the personal example of honesty, uprightness and simple living. The enforcement of the law is solely the responsibility of the Executive Department, but I invite all to join the Executive in wielding the potent power of moral example, and I particularly urge the Congress to assist in conceiving those reforms that will contribute to a moral renaissance of our people.
Let me, however, add that it is wasted effort to steep the young in virtue and morality only to let them realize as they grow up that their elders are neither moral nor virtuous. We -must, therefore, see to it that the prac­tices allowed by law in government and business, in the professions and labor unions, in field and factory—in every area of national endeavor—conform as much as possible with the moral and the ethical. Such practices can be sustained and upheld only if we can at the same time create a strong public opinion that will actively approve them and vigilantly condemn the contrary.
In our actions, we should not be guided only by what is legal. We must go beyond legality into the demands of morality. Our acts must not only be legal but must be moral as well.
THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC GROWTH
The second and far-reaching need of the Nation is the solution of the problems pertinent to our economic growth and development. It encompasses all our aspirations to attain self-sufficiency in food and a higher standard of living.
We must face the problem of economic growth with preferential emphasis. Proper economic development will raise the income of our people and the revenues of the government. It will thus produce the additional funds and facilities necessary for effectively discharging the other functions of government and for meeting the needs of our population. We must ever bear in mind the funda­mental fact that it is through the adequate advance of the national economy that a higher standard of living can be attained by our people. We must accelerate the coming of that day when this country shall be not merely the exploited domain of the privileged few but a land where the common man shall stand erect, the equal of his fellow men, able to protect his rights and possessions, and sharing in dignity and freedom in the task of building an ever greater Nation.
The Dimensions of Our Economic Deficiencies
Before assuming the responsibilities of the present, let us first determine the magnitude of our tasks. In this way we may measure the dimensions of the efforts we must exert in order to succeed.
That magnitude is evident in the rapid growth of our population, and in the corresponding increase in the demand for food, shelter, schools and jobs.
Philippine population is now growing at the annual rate of 3.2 per cent. This means approximately one million more people every year to feed, to house, to clothe and to employ. What are the implications of this rate of growth?
On consumption of essential foods.—By merely main­taining present consumption levels of essential foods—rice, bread, meat and dairy products—which are below nutri­tional standards, we have to increase rice production by 1.56 million cavans per year, meat by 14 million kilos and milk and dairy products by 11 million pounds.
On housing.—Our housing problem defies imagination. In 1960 there were 4,566,000 households in the country, By 1965, based on an estimated 130,000 more households formed each year, the total will increase to some five and one-third million. The rapid concentration of famines in urban centers and the inadequate housing facilities available at the present time emphasize the magnitude of the re­sources required to provide shelter, not to say civilized dwellings, for our people.
On education.—Expanding population means that gov­ernment services must correspondingly increase. There will be an average of 960 thousand children reaching school age every year. Subtracting the normal loss in graduates and dropouts, the total student population of the country will continue to increase at the rate of no less than 600 thousand each year.
On employment.—In 1960 the number of the labor force was 10.2 million. This number will likely increase at the average rate of 360 thousand every year for the next five years. If we are merely to prevent the unemployment rate from increasing, we must create job opportunities for this number of people each year. We must also absorb the backlog of the unemployed and provide fuller employ­ment to the underemployed.
These are only some of the hard facts of our social and economic needs. They are the urgent requirements of our growing population.
The Basis of Past Economic Growth 
During the last fifteen years since independence, Philippine economic growth was characterized by many factors and circumstances, namely—

the adoption of exchange controls in December 1949;
tax exemption privileges enjoyed by new and neces­sary industries, which include all customs duties, compensating taxes, sales taxes and internal revenue taxes;
one billion pesos worth of bond issues for reconstruc­tion and development as authorized by R. A. No. 1000;
our traditional export industries—coconut products, sugar, mining and logging and lumber mills had just been restored to pre-war capacities;
the extremely strong and stable world market for copra, our principal export;
the almost total absence of manufacturing industries so that consumer goods in finished form constituted the main bulk of our imports;
the high level of available foreign exchange; and
the windfall of war damage payments and aids from the United States.

Overall Growth Rates.—The character of the period was manifested in some of the overall statistics of economic growth during this era. Taking the period from 1950 to 1959 as a whole, gross domestic product increased at a compound rate of 6.3 per cent per year while total produc­tion grew at about 3 per cent,
Domestic production was augmented by substantial im­portation. Imports were financed by rising export receipts, by the in-flow of foreign capital largely in the form of re-invested earnings, substantial foreign donations and by a reduction in the country’s international reserves.
The combination of growing domestic production and substantial imports increased the availability of goods and services in the economy. These were largely absorbed by consumption which increased at the rate of 3.3% per annum per capita. Investments were only increased on a per capita basis at the rate of 1.3% per year. During that period the country was only investing at the rate of P8.62 for every P100.00 worth of gross product available. The rapid growth in domestic production was achieved with relatively small investment of capital. During the decade. it took only P1.36 of investments to get each PI.00 increase in domestic, product
Recent Changes in Policies
In the last two years, fairly radical changes in policies have occurred. On April 25, 1960 the cheap dollar policy of the Central Bank came to a close. The policy had under­gone several modifications before that date. But these modifications took somewhat less direct forms. Thus the exchange tax of 17% increased the exchange rate for most important transactions from P2.015 to P2.358. Barter made it possible for exporters of certain grades of commodities to appropriate a portion of the premium on foreign exchange. Finally, the margin fee which replaced the exchange tax effectively raised the exchange rate.
On December 31, 1955, Executive Order No. 150 in­creased tariff duties on several commodities and on June 22, 1957, Congress passed the Revised Customs Code of the Philippines which also raised the duties on some lines of imports. These had the effect of raising the cost of imports. But it was not until April 25, 1960 that the Government took official cognizance of the fact that the rate of P2.00 per US $1.00 was unrealistic.
Many firms are now losing gradually the benefits of the tax exemption law. In its stead, the Basic Industries Act provided a more limited tax exemption for the machinery and equipment importation of “basic industries.” Only import duties, special import taxes and other levies on importation are waived.
What does all these mean? Over all, profits on foreign exchange will cease to be a source of inducement for invest­ments. To some extent, the Basic Industries Act and the Tariff Code may provide specific inducements to particular types of enterprises. It is safe to anticipate, however, that more than at any time during the last ten years, business enterprises will have to rely for attractiveness of economic efficiency in processing and in distribution.
Significance of the New Policies
Two conclusions follow from the premises:
1. The field for investment during the next ten years will be much narrower at the start because the tests of attractiveness and. feasibility will be more rigorous.
2. The character of the investments will change. More basic developmental effort will be neces­sary.
Further development of mining, agriculture and forestry will involve more substantial investments in basic facilities—roads, irrigation and water control system, warehouses, heavy equipment for clearing and cultivating, pest control equipment, housing, etc. This is the result of bringing less developed lands under cultivation. The development of forestry will involve exploiting more remote timber lands. The expansion of mineral production will mean more extensive exploitation and development of deposits in more remote places. Further progress in industrializa­tion will mean the establishment of facilities for processing raw materials.
During the past ten years, the chief industries which were newly established, being devoted to the later stages of processing, assembly and packaging, had to be located in or around Manila, near the principal markets. In the coming years, the principal industries will likely be located near sources of cheap power or raw materials. Larger investments will be required in the country to set up new communities with all the facilities involved in building water systems, electric power generating and distribution plants, sewerage systems, housing, roads and communications facilities.
Further growth in the Philippine economy will thus involve larger average investments than in the past. The country will need to rely to a larger extent on external resources from foreign aid, institutional loans, and foreign investment.
To look at this picture in terms of the statistics of overall economic performance, if from 1950 to 1959 the equivalent of P1.00 of additional output in the economy could be achieved by overall investments in fixed assets and inven­tory of PI.36, in the coming years it will likely take between P2.50 and P3.00 of investment to achieve PI.00 of growth.
The other side of investment is saving. To try and double the rate of investment will mean that we have to increase the rate of savings in order to continue the growth of per capita product in this country.
THE ECONOMY TODAY
Thus, today we must begin our labors at a point of economic difficulties. To fully realize the severity of the tasks before us we must recognize that:
Firstly, the country has fully exhausted the potentialities for growth offered by the complement of policies ruling over the decade of the 1950’s. Over the last three years from 1958 to 1960, the growth rate of real gross national product has declined.
Secondly, it has become obvious that the impetus to investments which exchange controls and various tax incentives provided has worked itself out.
Thirdly, the country already enjoys to the fullest extent the export potential feasible under present exchange and trade policies. The weakening of world copra prices has caused the country’s export earnings to level off from the rather steep growth of the last ten years. Even the stability of our earnings from sugar exports is threatened by the current move in the U”. S. Congress to have the United States purchase sugar on the basis of global quota and at “world free market prices.”
Fourthly, this weakening of our export potentials as­sumes most serious proportions in the light of an immediate balance of payments problems. Philippine international reserves have dropped to a precariously low level—unprecedentedly lower than any which has caused great concern in the past.
Finally, we are faced with a serious population problem. Philippine population growth is one of the highest in the world. The country’s requirements for consumer and capital goods must grow with it.
Urgency of the Problem
The urgency of the problems of the present definitely calls for drastic changes in our monetary, fiscal and ex­change policies. Because of government inaction, specula­tion has become the order of our day. Exporters have been holding back negotiations of export sales. Importers have been fast building up inventories of imported goods in anticipation of higher costs.
Uncertainty and instability are visible under the symp­toms of rising prices, low purchasing power of the currency and increasing unemployment. Fiscal revenues have not increased in proportion to the clamor for more government expenditures. Consequently, the public debt has increased considerably.
But most important of all, our own investors have for at least the past three years held off making long range plans until the government policies become clearer and more stable. The climate, far from being beneficent to the type of long-term saving and investment which our situation requires, is hostile to long-range planning and encourages short-term speculation.
In the light of these facts, I must declare that govern­ment action is imperative. To this end, we must—
a) establish immediately a new, stable base for business valuation and planning to remove the uncertainties that pervade the present economic atmosphere; and
b) set clear directions for overall economic, monetary, fiscal and commercial policies and for government invest­ment programs in order to generate a new dynamic for continued economic growth.
THE FIVE-YEAR INTEGRATED SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROGRAM 
Need for an Economic Development Program
It is essential for the government to formulate and adopt an integrated economic program. Without it, all economic development efforts will be haphazard, sterile, and inef­fectual. There will be uncertainty and the business com­munity will remain in a state of doubt as to what economic policies, decisions, and activities the government will undertake.
Past Efforts.—The sluggishness in the pace of economic development in recent years was largely traceable to our failure to officially adopt a concrete economic blueprint that sets down vividly the course which the public authorities are to pursue in the matter of promoting economic growth and which the business community and the people at large may utilize to advantage as a guidepost to their own efforts.
It is true that there were attempts to formulate an economic planning program for the country, notably by the National Economic Council. The last program for­mulated by the Council was for the period 1959-1962-The plan, however, remained good on paper only as it did not receive presidential approval, much less congressional adoption.
Our Program.—I am, therefore, submitting to this Congress, as part of this message, an integrated five-year socio-economic development program which we propose to adopt and implement during our tenure and which both the Government and the private sector may use as a guide. This program focuses attention on the most pressing eco­nomic problems of the country and incorporates within its framework our economic philosophy translated into con­crete, appropriate policy measures and institutional reforms.
As it shall be tedious to read the whole program on this occasion, I have appended it to this message as Annex A.* For a proper appraisal of this program, I suggest for sup­plemental reference the recent study made by the World Bank on the Philippine national economy, dated January 4, 1962, as well as the last economic development plan made by the National Economic Council, printed copies of which are also appended hereto.
Objectives of Our Program
While I commend to Congress the full perusal of this socio-economic program, I should like to underscore some of its more significant highlights.
The great goals we seek and the critical condition of the economy today make it essential for the Government to accomplish the three-fold objective of: 1) immediately restoring economic stability; 2) alleviating the plight of the common man; and 3) establishing a dynamic basis for future growth.
RESTORING ECONOMIC STABILITY
The present speculative atmosphere in Philippine busi­ness springs from uncertainty with respect to government policies. With the objective of immediately stabilizing the economy, and apropos of the five principal sources of instability I have earlier indicated, we propose to imple­ment—
First, a program of exchange rate adjustment and unifi­cation and a procedure for orderly decontrol to transfer the allocation of foreign exchange to a genuinely free market;
Second, a set of complementary measures to protect Philippine and Filipino industry and agriculture from undue foreign competition at their “infant stages”; and
Third, a set of policies and measures to provide guar­antees to foreign investors in particular lines of investments, principally mineral exploration and heavy industries such as iron and steel and basic chemicals, together with an official declaration of preference for joint international business ventures with substantial Filipino capital and management participation.
GENUINE DECONTROL AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE PROGRAM
It is my privilege to inform Congress that yesterday, January 21, 1962 I approved a unanimous decision by the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, embodied in its Cir­cular No. 133, to institute the first large measure of genuine decontrol in our foreign exchange transactions since the establishment of exchange controls over a dozen years ago. This is both in fulfillment of our electoral pledge to the Filipino people and in compliance with the provision of the law requiring decontrol by 1963. In an atmosphere of freedom, our entrepreneurs and citizens may now achieve prosperity for themselves and the country not through arti­ficial advantage but through their talent, integrity and in­dustry.
Exchange control had become a cesspool of corruption that brought disgrace to the Nation. With genuine de­control now in effect, we have removed a vital source of graft and, I trust, we have thus shown that we are ready to give up a part of the economic and political powers of the Presidency to eradicate corruption and promote the national wellbeing.
This action had become imperative and desirable for several reasons. The imbalances of the past must be righted. The administration of controls had become so complicated and cumbersome that only a sweeping change could remedy the situation. There was such a shocking maladministration of economic policy, particularly as regards fiscal and foreign exchange policies, that inflationary forces had been reactivated and our dollar reserve had been vir­tually wiped out. At the same time, a new climate was desirable in which our economy could move forward with confidence and optimism despite transitional difficulties.
It may now be expected that with genuine decontrol instituted in our foreign exchange transactions, a completely new atmosphere will prevail in our economy. The alloca­tion of foreign exchange and the determination of the ex­change rate will be left to market forces rather than to the arbitrary decisions of administrators. We should clear the obstacles which have grown up in the past during the re­gime of controls, and liberate the energies and imagination of our people and our entrepreneurs for economic projects of lasting value to the country. For the first time, the people will have it in their hands to determine the true external value of the peso by their freedom in buying and selling, without the necessity of licensing. With the uncer­tainties of an arbitrary control mechanism removed, I expect renewed investments to take place. Furthermore, with barriers to free movement removed, I expect foreign invest­ments to come in an ever greater flow to supplement our savings and augment our investments.
As is the case with any necessary moves of a sweeping nature, there will be difficulties at the outset, but these will be transitional and should lay the base for real economic stability with a more rational economic system in the future. Some of these difficulties are the necessary outcome of the previous practice of disguising overall arbitrary and in­flationary policies by favoring a few commodities with spe­cial treatment. In so doing, they only postponed the real solution to our problems by diverting our productive re­sources away from the production of substitutes for these commodities.
In order to prevent runaway inflationary movements, the Monetary Board has taken complementary measures to restrain the unwarranted creation of credit, especially for speculative purposes. As a further protection to con­sumers, I have directed the Secretary of Justice to study and alert the applicability of Article 186 of the Revised Penal Code aimed at conspiracies and combinations in restraint of trade or collusions in fixing prices.
All these moves have been taken after consultation with and approval by the International Monetary Fund. In ad­dition, we have secured commitments from the United States Government and from private banking institutions to support our decontrol program. I am glad to announce that the Special Presidential Mission to the United States headed by Acting Secretary of Finance Fernando E. V. Sison has secured financial support for these moves in the amount of $300 million, This does not include the amount of $55 million still available from the International Mone­tary Fund, $93.7 million worth of commodity accommoda­tions from U.S. Law 480 and $73 million from additional war damage payments. We can count on further support from both international and United States entities including the U. S. Treasury once our decontrol program is underway, as well as financial support that may be negotiated with other countries.
In substantiation of this statement, I quote hereunder a dispatch datelined Washington, relayed by UPI and pub­lished in this afternoon’s papers, as follows:
“Washington, Jan 21 (UPI)—The United States demonstrated its support of the new Philippine program by announcing it will provide the Philippines with loans from the Agency for International Development and the Export-Import Bank.
“The U.S. Treasury will also assist President Diosdado Macapagal’s new foreign exchange program with its stabilization fund.”
Our decontrol program, therefore, is fully backed up by massive and more than adequate financial support that we have merited from external sources. With the coopera­tion of all concerned, I am confident that the decontrol program will succeed to pave the way for a stronger economy and prosperity in freedom for our people.
I must emphasize that the launching of genuine decontrol is only the short-term commencement of our long-term economic program. We are laying the basis for stable and orderly growth with a stable and orderly currency. I am arranging for large long-run production and development credits to bolster our investment effort, as distinguished from short-term commercial credits which have been used at times for speculative purposes. I am also going ahead with plans to set up a private industrial development bank, towards whose subscription we expect to secure external financing both from international agencies and from funds generated under U.S. Public Law 480.
I feel confident of the success of the decontrol program, both because of the complementary measures that go with it and the massive financial support which we have merited from external sources. I call on our people to face the new situation without apprehen­sion and excitement and to set their sights on the prospects of a bright future rather than on the temporary difficulties of the present. I assure our people that I have taken this step in fulfillment of my sworn duty to serve only their welfare. Some transitional difficulties are perhaps inevit­able but in due time, the situation will open the enjoyment of a better life for our people. The best norm of conduct for all is to behave with restraint and patriotism so as not to place undue strain on our currency. I feel confi­dent that the people will comport themselves in their own best interests.
As we have taken the measure of genuine decontrol for the wellbeing of our people, we will not brook any conspi­racies against them by attempts to foil up the program. Should any speculative movements arise, I declare that the ample financial resources which we have secured will be deployed against movements unwarranted by normal market forces and that the full force of the law will be brought to bear against speculators and conspirators.
In any event, such speculative movements cannot be of long duration, as our economic development program goes into gear and the country’s production begins to fill the pipelines of commerce and to elevate the living standards of our people.
To cope with the long-run foreign exchange problems of the country, the integrated economic program sets as one of its major objectives the promotion of our export trade in order to raise adequate foreign exchange resources a) to meet the import requirements of the nation for the next five years; b) to honor all the foreign exchange liabilities of the country including investment remittances, interest and amor­tization on foreign loans and repatriation of capital; and c) to generate an increase in the international reserves which will provide the fund adequate to stabilize the international value of the peso.
Policy of Protection to Domestic Industries
One of the principal fears of business in the decontrol of foreign exchange is the loss of the protection which exchange controls provided to domestic industry against un­due external domination. There is no valid ground for this fear. As the exchange control machinery is dismantled, the alternative means of achieving the legitimate ends of controls shall be instituted. To this end, I have availed of the power granted us by law to increase the rates of import duty on nearly 700 articles already being produced by domestic industries in order to provide them a means to meet the loss of the protection they have enjoyed under exchange control. Besides this measure, we propose—
1) To make such further increases in the tariff as may be found necessary to provide a reasonable margin of preference which will render domestic producers more competitive;
2) Wherever necessary, the Tariff Commission shall recommend the imposition of countervailing duties under Section 302 of the Tariff Code to offset benefits that may be derived by imports from foreign subsidies. To the same end, the Secretary of Finance has been instructed to immediately cause to be undertaken a study of articles of imports that are being “dumped” into the Philippine market from abroad within the context of Section 301 of Republic Act 1937;
3) The Tariff Commission has been directed to imme­diately investigate, in accordance with Paragraph G of Section 402 of the Tariff Code, whether and to what extent commodities imported by the Philippines from countries with which a trade agreement has been entered are being im­ported in such increased quantities as to cause or threaten serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive products in order to recommend the establishment of import quotas for the protection of the domestic industries affected.
Policy on Nationalization as It Affects Foreign Capital Inflow
It will be noted that the program raises the necessity of earnestly attracting foreign capital to assist in the financing of the program. For this reason, a healthy climate for foreign investments must resolutely be created. This task is related to nationalism, with respect to which it is desirable to set forth concretely and clearly the position of the Administration.
The Administration upholds nationalism. Properly chan­neled, nationalism is a constructive and powerful force in the growth of a nation. Its assertion considers relevant factors such as choice of field and timing. It has been asserted wisely in the nationalization of the retail trade, which is the channel of distribution of the elemental re­quirements of our masses in their day-to-day living. It has been asserted even more wisely in the nationalization of the rice and corn industries, which provide the staple food of our people.
While we uphold that the principal responsibility for development should belong to Filipino citizens, who must be the principal determinants as well as chief beneficiaries of Philippine economic progress, we at the same time caution against the type of radical nationalism and nationalization measures that deter the coming of foreign assistance in our economic development. We must be sincere in at­tracting foreign capital to invest in productive enterprises in our country in joint ventures with Filipino businessmen and must show this sincerity not in words but in deeds.
ALLEVIATION OF THE PLIGHT OF THE COMMON MAN
The second goal of our integrated economic program is the immediate alleviation of the plight of the common man. In comparison with the living standards of the relatively wealthier countries, ours in the Philippines is far from adequate. The per capita consumption of superior foods like meat, eggs and milk, beans and vegetables is far below healthy nutritional standards and much lower than what obtains in wealthier countries.
Moreover, within the Nation itself, the distribution of welfare is far from satisfactory. This is indeed a nation of contrasts where very few regions and communities enjoy affluence in contrast to widespread poverty in others.
It is our avowed task in the program to translate objec­tives into specific improvements in the overall level of eco­nomic welfare and its distribution. Improvement in this sense means that our production capacity must grow more rapidly than the growth of our population. It also means that those regions that have lagged behind in progress must be given special assistance to enable them to participate more fully in over-all national progress.
The Rice and Corn Program.—In accordance with my pledge, I have incorporated, as a major feature of our five-year socio-economic plan, a rice and corn program to bring about, at the earliest possible time, sufficiency in those cereals at prices within the reach of our masses. It is paradoxical that in a land with resources ideally suited to the production of rice, the country is unable to produce enough of this product which is the staple food of our people. We must liquidate this problem with resolve and success as a first priority. It is ironical to talk of magnificent plans for progress and prosperity if we cannot even provide the rice and corn that our common people cannot go without in their daily lives. Before attempting anything else, let us work together to insure that our people have and be able to afford the rice and corn that they need in their daily living.
We shall also concentrate our efforts to raise agricultural productivity throughout all the regions in the country in order to achieve self-sufficiency in food production. It is incumbent upon government to provide improved irrigation and water control facilities, the continuation of subsidies for fertilizers and seeds, expansion of research programs for developing high-yielding and disease-resistant varieties of agricultural crops, the establishment of liberal credit facili­ties, and the improvement of marketing and transportation networks.
Program for Employment.—-Our greatest task in improv­ing the welfare of the masses is to ensure that opportunities for employment are generated. Our program envisions that the attainment of the target increase in overall domestic production of about 6 per cent per annum over the period FY 1963 to 1967 will ensure that some 330,000 to 360,000 jobs will be provided annually to absorb a large portion of the yearly increase in the labor force. It is also a part of our program that the greater portion of the annual increase in employment is to be absorbed in industrial production. This will increase the average wage earnings of the mass of our workers.
Public Services.—I also propose greater outlays by the Government for public services designed to improve the general living standards of the people, particularly in the less developed areas of this country. It is my belief that the Government can provide a total outlay of P656.6 mil­lion for public education, about P15 million for low cost housing projects and P470 million for public health over the next five years. The public health program shall include expansion of health services in rural areas, water supply, reduction of infant mortality, tuberculosis and malaria con­trol, establishment of medical research centers, and nutri­tion research.
ESTABLISHMENT OF DYNAMIC BASIS FOR FUTURE GROWTH
Our final goal is to establish a framework of policies that will give a stable basis and a more realistic and sober impetus to a new growth trend which will extend much farther into the future. The new dynamic for economic progress that we seek and should attain must be of a more genuine quality and must provide a richer and longer lasting energy for national progress.
In assuming our proper responsibilities, we shall be guided by the economic philosophy of Faith in the Filipino. We believe that economic development is principally a task of private enterprise and not of government. The government’s role is to create a favorable environment that will provide the inducements necessary, in terms of suitable policies and measures needed, to foster economic growth and stability. It must be in a position to devise new and effective methods, democratic in character and spirit, to induce the private sector—properly called the dynamic sector—to risk idle capital for development purposes.
The exchange rate adjustment and the stabilization pro­gram are expected of themselves to create a fundamental climate favorable to investments in the required lines of activity. The specific role of government will be to provide direct assistance where needed, to establish required social overhead facilities, and to ensure that bottle-necks to pro­duction are neither created nor allowed to persist.
I must point out, however, that the restoration to a large degree of the freedom of enterprise does not remove from government the obligation to exercise economic leadership. On the contrary, government leadership not only becomes all the more important, but its exercise must be all the more firm as it is all the more just, imaginative and skillful.
Requisites for Government Economic Leadership.—The first requirement for government is to ensure the judicious application of public investment programs to the establish­ment of basic facilities such as roads and irrigation systems, transportation and communications networks, hydroelectric power, harbor facilities, and the development of land, forest and mineral resources. The program envisions that it is feasible for the Government to put up directly P2,809 mil­lion over the five-year period 1963 to 1967 for these purposes. These investments will amount to an annual average of P562 million to be financed from current government sav­ings, reparations, foreign loans, and domestic bond issues.
The second requirement for government is the establish­ment of a complement of policies designed to induce and mobilize the maximum of internal domestic savings and the maximum external financing in order to sustain the overall investment requirements of the economic development program.
Over the five years from FY 1963 to 1967, we anticipate that a total of P11,500 million must be mobilized in the form of domestic savings out of a total gross national income of P78,200 million expected over the same period.
All the powers at present available to induce savings out of current incomes must be put to effective use. The Central Bank of the Philippines shall be urged to push with greater vigor the establishment of local community cooperative banks and savings and loan associations and to encourage these institutions to offer more attractive in­ducements for systematic savings plans.
It is necessary to undertake a careful re-examination of the tax structure so as to ascertain the impact of the present tax rates on investment activity and living costs; to adjust the rates or eliminate those taxes that are either unduly inequitable or are hampering the growth of invest­ments and output and to recommend new tax measures to support the government’s socio-economic program. The Executive-Legislative Tax Commission should immediately apply itself to this problem and make appropriate recom­mendations as early as possible for desirable changes in the tax structure consistent with the basic objectives of economic policy.
It is likewise the objective to promote the expansion of the facilities and resources of existing financial interme­diaries, and the establishment of new ones designed to induce habits of thrift in, and mobilize the savings of the rural communities.
In anticipation of foreign investments and loans from abroad, our program proposes to provide facilities for private business that will enable them to meet the requirements of foreign investors and creditors in a manner that will redound to the greatest advantage of the country.
We likewise foresee that the establishment of a new complement of policies necessitates adjustment—the bene­ficiaries of older policies are likely to suffer the burden of losing benefits. It is incumbent on government to antici­pate and measure the costs of adjustment, and to distribute its burden in an equitable manner.
THE OVERALL TARGETS OF THE PROGRAM
The goal of the program is essentially to ensure that domestic production, augmented by imports, shall be ade­quate to supply the needs of our people.
In order to meet the requirements and to improve over­all levels of living, gross domestic product needs to grow over the five-year period at a compound rate of 6 per cent. The annual growth rate must rise from 5.5 per cent between 1962 and 1963 up to 7.0 per cent from 1966 to 1967.
The targets are feasible provided—
1. An average of 16.1 per cent of gross domestic product is channeled into gross domestic investments during the five fiscal years;
2. Gross domestic savings including reinvestments of foreign earnings in the Philippines reach 13 per cent of gross domestic product in FY 1963, 13.8 per cent in 1964, 14.6 per cent in 1965, 15.4 per cent in 1966, and 16.0 per cent in 1967;
3. There is a total net inflow of new foreign capital into the country of roughly U. S. $860 million during the five-year period; and
4. The export earnings of the country total U. S. $3.7 billion during the period or an average of $740 million annually.
The rate of gross domestic investments is intended to mobilize new capital formation of P12.7 billion over the five fiscal years. This amount has been allocated on the basis of a first approximation of sectoral and regional priori­ties that give emphasis on the production of import substi­tutes such as integrated iron and steel, basic chemicals, pulping plants, expansion of agricultural food production and processing, and the development of the cattle and dairy industries.
The Government’s share in the total investment target is placed at P2.8 billion or 22 per cent of the total target of P12.7 billion. The public investment program includes principally P1.3 billion for water supply, roads, highways and irrigation, and Pl.l billion for power development, and expansion of railroad lines and of telecommunications.
In these magnitudes, the total program can be financed entirely from non-inflationary sources: from domestic savings as well as foreign loans and investments. In ad­dition to the normal growth of domestic savings flowing through such financial intermediaries as the commercial banks, the Government Service Insurance System, the Social Security System, the Postal Savings Bank and the private insurance companies, the program contemplates the estab­lishment of rural savings institutions and cooperative banks to encourage systematic savings out of current income in the farm areas.
The anticipated government revenues during the program period are expected to cover current expenditures and a little savings to finance a portion of the public investment program. The balance will be financed out of bond issue sold at competitive money rates directly to insurance com­panies, pension funds, private banks, and other private investors.
An outstanding feature of the program is the contem­plated reorganization of public administration to improve the machinery for the formulation and implementation of consistent economic plans and fiscal and monetary policies, to achieve maximum coordination among the various de­partments of the Executive Branch of Government in the pursuit of economic objectives, and to attain more rigorous control over government budgetary and developmental ex­penditures.
SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
I shall take the initiative of immediately implementing those remedial measures that need no legislation, and such part of the program will be the responsibility of the Execu­tive.
But many of the specific measures that must be estab­lished require legislative action. They shall be measures of far-reaching implications.
I, therefore, recommend for your consideration the enactment of legislation which would establish, promote, and sustain the following specific measures:
For Moral Regeneration
1. The establishment and financing of a Moral Commis­sion composed of outstanding and upright leaders in government, religion, education and the professions. This Com­mission shall study and recommend ways and means by which all elements and institutions of the country may be mobilized towards the goal of national moral regeneration.
For the Immediate Alleviation of the Plight of the Common Man
2. The adoption of a comprehensive program on rice and corn which shall achieve self-sufficiency in these cereals at prices within the reach of the masses; and the establish­ment and financing of a Rice and Corn Administration to implement the program. This entity shall absorb the functions of the NARIC and shall coordinate various pro­grams concerning the production, processing, and marketing of rice.
3. The enactment of legislation to assist private enter­prise in the creation of job opportunities. Specific measures will be submitted to Congress to support employment proj­ects that not only will create jobs but will also simulta­neously increase production and productivity.
4. The appropriation of funds for the construction of apartment houses for displaced squatters and persons per­taining to the lowest-income groups who shall pay nominal rentals for occupancy thereof.
5. Greater outlays by the government for the improve­ment and expansion of essential public services designed to raise the general living standards of the people, especially in economically-depressed regions of the country. These public services include education, more low-cost housing, and public health.
For Support of the Decontrol Program, Restoration of Economic Stability and Establishment of Dynamic Bases for Future Growth
6. Further revision of tariff rates as Congress may deem necessary with the following objective:
a. To use tariffs as instruments of economic development by protecting our domestic industries until such reasonable time when these industries can be exposed to world competition.
b. To discourage conspicuous consumption by imposing prohibitive tariffs on luxuries.
7. The passage of a foreign investments law, with the following objectives;
a. To clearly delineate the fields of economic activities open to foreign capital, thereby protecting the preferential rights of Filipinos in certain economic fields.
b. To attract new foreign investments to flow into the country.
c. To define unequivocably the treatment of foreign capital, particularly concerning repatriation of capital and remittances of profits.
8. The enactment of an appropriate law imposing a selective export tax on certain protected exports, and on raw materials that can be processed locally, with the following objectives:
a. To prevent inflationary pressures arising from decontrol and generated by generated by windfall incomes of recipients of foreign exchanges.
b. To expand government sources of investible funds for overhead projects essential to economic growth, by obtaining such funds from a sector which has ample resources.
9. The repeal of the margin levy on foreign exchange, to give relief to the consumers who will ultimately bear the burden of adjustments in the exchange rates arising from the decontrol program.
10. The repeal of the barter law.
11. To re-examine and revise the tax structure so as to ascertain the impact of the present tax rates on investment activity and living costs; to adjust the rates or eliminate those that are inequitable and to enact new tax laws to support the government’s industrialization program. Spe­cific tax bills shall be presented to Congress in due course during the regular session.
12. To amend the charters of the Development Bank of the Philippines, the Government Service Insurance System and the Social Security System in order to funnel the funds of the last two entities to the Development Bank of the Philippines for lending purposes, with the view to expanding the authority of the latter to grant long-term industrial and investment loans for productive enterprises.
13. The creation of an Anti-Smuggling Office to era­dicate smuggling activities that seriously deprive the Na­tional Treasury of due customs and internal revenue receipts,
14. The adoption of the five-year integrated socio-economic development program embodied in this message, in order that this program may become not only the program of the Administration but also of the entire Government. Thereby, the program shall serve as the nation’s guidepost for economic progress and shall be effectively implemented through the joint efforts of the people and the Government.
CONCLUSION
Need for Sacrifice
Allow me to impress upon you and upon all citizens of the Republic that the task of achieving a modicum of economic development, especially in a developing country like ours, requires serious and concerted effort on the part of both the Government and the people.
Attainment of the desired goals will depend mainly upon public support and a sympathetic understanding of our objectives.
The Government takes the initiative and provides the inducements necessary in terms of suitable policies and measures needed to foster economic growth and stability.
The people, on the other hand, must realize that eco­nomic development involves, particularly during transi­tory stages, sacrifices of magnitude and the subordination of personal ambition and interest to the general welfare.
I say then with candor and emphasis that our people must be ready to undergo sacrifices. The prospects of better times are not likely to be realized without the imposition of self-discipline and the assumption of certain social responsibilities. Progress and prosperity will come. It will come, if all the people rally to maintain economic freedom and security and a higher standard of living for themselves. Single-handedly we cannot realize these ob­jectives. Together, we shall.
Executive-Legislative Collaboration
The responsibilities of the Executive and Legislative branches of the Government are just as demanding. All the agencies of the Executive, including financial institutions and corporations, will be mobilized towards a coor­dinated implementation of the program. We shall take particular pains to see that there is a minimum of conflict between our announced goals, our economic philosophy, and the day-to-day operations of all those government agencies with which the private sector is continuously in contact.
But the Executive alone cannot meet the prodigious tasks that are required to supply the needs and demands of our people. The Legislative branch has a share in this responsibility. I seek your full cooperation. I will submit additional legislative proposals to this body which are necessitated by an integrated analysis of our economic situation, our problems and our requirements that consti­tute the basis of our program. From time to time, as the situation requires, I shall come to consult you on pressing matters requiring legislative action.
No one is more aware than I of the coordinate impor­tance of the Executive and Legislative departments of our Government. I am aware of their basic independence of each other.
I am also aware of the need for cooperation between them if the business of government is not to suffer, and if the welfare of the people is to be safeguarded. I there­fore appeal to each member of the Fifth Congress to set aside partisanship and contribute his experience and wis­dom to the common task entrusted to us by our people. We face a challenge to our free political system, to our dedication as public servants and to our patriotism as Filipinos.
We have been elected under different parties but we have been elected by the same people. As the people did not mind our political parties in placing in our hands their welfare and future, so are we called upon not to mind our parties in serving their well-being. Adhering firmly to this attitude, with minds anxious over our people’s difficulties and hearts full of sympathy for their just long­ings for a better life, I have faith that Almighty God will show us the way that we can take together towards the fulfillment of our Nation’s dream for a life of dignity, prosperity and freedom.

Message
of
His Excellency Diosdado Macapagal
President of the Philippines
To the Second Session of the Fifth Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Delivered on January 28, 1963]
One year ago we stood on this same platform to announce before the Nation the tasks that we pledged ourselves to perform. We stand here again today to render an accounting to the Congress and to the people of what has been done to accomplish these tasks, where the country now stands and what next is to be done to build the economic and social progress that has become the urgent right of all our people.
The past year has been a crucial one. We began our labor for the people under extremely adverse conditions. The gov­ernment was bankrupt; it was operating on a deficit of P250 million. The international reserves were in extremis, with the dollar reserves at $103 million and the Central Bank obligated in the sum of $341 million at preferred rates ranging from P2.00 to P3.20 per $1.00. Graft and corruption had seeped into every nook and crevice of the government, both national and local. The people had assumed an attitude of cynicism, an attitude that made them shrug off corruption as inevitable. While population was increasing at the rate of 3.2 per cent annually, the rate of economic growth had decreased from 7.8 per cent in 1955 to an annual average of only 4.4 percent each year thereafter until and including 1961, and symptomatic of the economic deterioration, prices were steadily rising to exorbitant heights without hope of abatement.
It was in this depressing setting that we undertook the difficult task of straightening out the national shambles and building the structure of a better future for our people.
We committed ourselves to the solution of two major problems facing the country. One was the need for moral regeneration and the other, the need for a faster rate of economic growth. We shall in this report recount what has been done toward the accomplishment of these tasks.
Before doing so, however, we beg your indulgence to express with candor some thoughts on relevant matters that have aroused the public interest. Among these has been the concern expressed for the two-party system because of our alleged desire to control both Houses of Congress by accepting leaders and members of the Opposition into the Administration.
Congress-Executive Relations
We reject the imputation that we seek the control of Congress. Having been in Congress ourself, we do not think any one can control Congress by making it do what it cannot be intelligently persuaded to do voluntarily. What we seek is the constitutional cooperation of Congress—that is to say, the cooperation that the Congress and the President owe to each other in the interest of the people in accordance with the party system of government which we have adopted in our Republic. That constitutional cooperation is best attained—and we submit that this was the intent of the Constitution—when Congress and the President pertain to the same political party. It is only this situation that makes possible party responsibility without which the two-party system is a farce. It was this situation under which all our predecessors had worked since the founding of the Republic. This would not mean placing Congress in the control of the Executive because, as it happened in 1951-53, the fact that the political party of the President had a majority in both Houses of Congress did not necessarily mean that the President had the cooperation, much less the control, of Congress. We submit that given the pitfalls of rabid partisanship, it is desirable for our democ­racy that the Congress and the President should pertain to the same party. This situation whereby the Congress and the Executive pertain to the same party should in the normal course be brought about in an election. However, if through an imperfect operation of the democratic mechanism which we strive continually to improve, this desirable situation does not result from an election, it is neither against democracy nor against the national interest to endeavor to bring about the situation through the inherent freedom or some other legitimate measures allowed in a democracy.
It was against the background of this political philosophy that in the course of the past year, many leaders of the people who enjoy the faith, confidence and support of their constituents, some of them being members of this Congress, have placed the interest of the people above their partisan in­terest and have joined cause with the Administration in the her­culean endeavor to promote a rapid rate of progress for our people. Their action is not to be gauged in terms of those drifting ways of the past but in the light of the urgency of courageous and decisive action called for by the national am­bition for monumental progress in the inspired present. We know that these leaders have taken these steps primarily be­cause of their conviction that the socio-economic blueprint that we are energetically carrying out in order to bring about rapidly the prosperity of our people is the right course for the Nation. We hereby make it of record, as the highest spokes­man of our people and in their name, for the judgment of our posterity that in our view, these leaders who have joined us in our endeavor have performed less of an act of partisan in­fidelity and more of an act of patriotism which our people approve of and accept with appreciation and gratitude.
Civil Liberties
The other matter to which we beg leave to refer in candor has been the anxiety shown for the Constitution and civil liber­ties because of alleged dictatorial, impatient and vindictive tendencies on our part. This concern is without basis in fact.
Permit me to state that we are too much of a lawyer to disregard the Constitution and the law. Our seeming im­patience is over unduly prolonged argumentation about the law because we believe that whenever there is legal controversy, which is unavoidable among lawyers, the best step in the public interest is to elevate the controversy to the Supreme Court, in the meantime go about our tasks, accept the decision of the Supreme Court when it is handed down, and then proceed in our ways of serving the people along the lines indicated by the Supreme Court decision. It has been our invariable attitude that irrespective of our personal views, we shall abide by and implement the decisions of the Supreme Court. As long as the President of the Republic abides by the decisions of the Su­preme Court, there can be and there will be no dictatorship in this country. Like all Filipinos, we are lovers of freedom and we are against dictatorship in our country, and whether now or in the future, we are with those who will fight the establish­ment of a dictatorship in our land.
In truth, our seeming impatience over fruitless wrangling is but a reflection of the impatience of our people to be given the chance to enjoy the good life to which they are entitled. Legal issues must be debated. But while we debate, the people feel the pangs of hunger and demand that their problems be solved before it is too late.
Indeed, we confess to one impatience—to the impatience which we believe to be the impatience of our people that measures be taken immediately to enable our impoverished people quickly to have a better life. To us, this is more than impatience; it is a passion. We cannot help feeling and thinking otherwise because we have personally known the pain of hunger and poverty.
Because of our actions which are reflective of the impatience and hunger of our people for a better life, it is possible that we may have hurt and offended others. We ask their forbearance. It is not our wish to hurt or prejudice anyone if we could avoid it. We bear no resentment against anybody. If it were possible, we wish all to be our friends. To say that we are vindictive is to trample upon the truth. There is abso­lutely no touch of vindictiveness in our being. The truth is, we have a task to pave the way for the improvement of the livelihood of our people within the span of our mandate and we intend to do this task in the best and most effective manner within the sanction of the Constitution and the law. We are resolved not to fail in this undertaking of achieving economic progress during our tenure. It is around this resolve that all our decisions and actions revolve. Accordingly, those who will help us we shall clasp as friends, irrespective of relations in the past; and similarly, those who will seek to frustrate us we shall be constrained to resist vigorously, likewise irrespective of events in the past. We deny the offense of vindictiveness, dictatorial tendency, disregard of law, and other imaginary offenses leveled against us. We confess only to one offense, if it be an offense, which is that we love our country and people dearly. Since we have only this opportunity of a life­time to help our people attain a better life, we are grimly resolved to sacrifice friendships and everything and even our own self, our own comfort, security and happiness, for the dedicated pursuit of bringing about the prosperity and hap­piness of our people in the quickest possible time.
Partisan conflict is perhaps unavoidable in a democracy like ours which is operated on the party system. At the beginning of our labor, we had wanted to avoid participation in partisan strife. Without now dwelling on the responsibility for the change, we have been lately constrained to take part in partisan activity within proper bounds in the conviction that without an increased political preponderance in our favor, we face frustration in the task of bringing about a sufficient degree of economic and social progress for our people during the period of our trust. If partisan contention is inevitable in a representative government, we fervently hope that it can be minimized for the sake of the public welfare. We ardently wish that more and more of us who are representing and leading our people will more and more recognize the occasions and matters where partisan attitude must end because there the national interest which requires united action begins. It is our fervent longing that one such matter and occasion that should be regarded as meriting united national action is the successful implementation of our socio-economic development program because of our conviction that it is only through the resultant general pros­perity that our masses can share the boon of a good life. It is our prayer that in things required for the success of the program, partisan strife can be avoided. Indeed, on our part, we have participated in partisan activity only as inevitably required by the need to insure the success of the Nation’s socio-economic development program.
MORAL REGENERATION
Anti-Graft Policy
We shall now dwell on our twin tasks of moral regeneration and a faster rate of economic growth. In undertaking a moral regeneration drive, we adopted a constructive and forward-looking outlook and policy. We have resorted more to con­structive, preventive and remedial measures for moral renais­sance than to punitive actions.
In accordance with a constructive anti-graft policy, we undertook a series of measures to eliminate the sources of cor­ruption in the Executive Branch of the government which is our prime field of responsibility. We abolished the system of foreign exchange controls, aware that this had become a festering source of venalities. We made appointments to im­portant positions on the primordial basis of integrity and honesty. We conducted searching investigations of government irregularities. We dismissed public officials for dishonesty, dereliction of duty, official irresponsibility, and grave abuse of authority and other similar violations of the code of upright public service. We have not spared even the closest friends—people whom we have long known and who had done much for us—because we believe that our duty is not to serve friends but to serve the people. We issued an executive order pro­hibiting government officials from having official transactions with any of the President’s immediate relatives. The members of our official family made public their assets and liabilities although this is not required by law.
We took positive steps to re-establish the moral identity of the Filipino. Our people are inherently a race of honest men and women. With a view to enhancing these qualities, we took official cognizance of acts of honesty, respect for the law, simple living, punctuality, courtesy, cleanliness, de­votion to the people in public trust, frugality, discouragement of gifts, discontinuance of large official retinues, patronage of native materials, and the like. We honored humble citizens who performed deeds of honesty. We conferred a Presidential Citation upon officials and individuals who have demonstrated adherence to the creed of honesty and integrity. Realizing the tremendous persuasive powers of the Presidency, we and our family have striven to set personal examples in honesty, simplicity and dedication.
In view of the number of wrongs deliberately or carelessly committed in the past, for the full investigation and prose­cution of which there would be no material time, we have limited punitive actions to a degree sufficient to deter similar wrongs in the future. Mainly, these cases consisted of those concerning the top offenders in certain categories of venalities, committed by Filipinos and aliens, which should be discouraged and eradicated as roadblocks to the progress of the country. We hope that the constructive and remedial results from these exemplary cases would be sufficient and would not constrain us to expand action in our determination to effect moral recon­struction as a prerequisite to national progress.
The categories of venalities on which we took action against the top offenders were the following: (1) aliens who organized networks of corruption to advance their business interests; (2) former aliens who, although not weaving elaborate webs of corruption, were engaged in venalities to promote their a business interest; (3) aliens who engaged in profiteering activities; (4) aliens who evaded the payment of taxes; and (5) aliens who, contrary to law, participated actively in par­tisan politics.
Among the nationals, we took action on the following persons: (1) those who utilized organized political power to build business empires, and vice-versa; (2) those who mis­used public trust to amass wealth; (3) those who evaded the payment of taxes; (4) those who perpetrated smuggling; (5) those who committed copra overpricing; and (6) those unscru­pulous labor leaders who have exploited their followers for selfish purposes.
In connection with the action taken against aliens who corrupted public officials, we have so far relieved fifteen high officials, accepted the resignation of one of our cabinet members and reassigned another cabinet member to another post. In acting on other irregularities, likewise relieved the presi­dent of the government commercial bank and the chairman of its board of directors who were our own appointees.
In this moral drive to which the Administration has de­dicated itself, the innocent need not fear, for they will not be molested. The well-to-do need not feel apprehension, for the drive is aimed not at them but at the unscrupulous oper­ators who, using unfair and illegal means, have amassed ill-gotten wealth to the detriment of the general welfare. In point of fact, our goal is to create conditions of fair and equal opportunity wherein the maximum number of our people may become prosperous and wealthy through honest toil. The busi­nessmen need not have anxieties, for the drive is not against businessmen but against powerful politicians who have used their political office and influence to dominate vital business ventures and compete with bona fide businessmen. Even the guilty will be given every opportunity to present and defend their case.
To those who promote their interest through hard work and integrity, we shall give the protective shield of the Ad­ministration and provide them with all the opportunities to advance further. But the law can be justly merciless, too, in its retribution on those who believe that they are above the law. We will be fair even to those who will be unfair to us, but we will act resolutely against those who betray the trust of the people. We believe that it is in this way that true democracy, which is the system which our people have cherished, will nourish in our country.
The results of our moral drive have been gratifying. The “tong” system in which businessmen made regular pay­ments to government officials has ended. The practices of pay­ing commission, percentage, overprice or kick-back in consideration of contracts and public service has been curbed. The webs of corruption which unscrupulous individuals had woven in our society through many years of unrestrained activity have been destroyed. The commission of graft at the higher echelons has been virtually terminated; at the lowest levels of government, it has been substantially minimized. We will relentlessly go after venalities at all levels of the public service.
ECONOMIC GROWTH
We shall now dwell on the most vital endeavor of our generation—the propulsion and maintenance of a faster rate of economic growth that can provide the needs of our multi­plying population. In facing our awesome responsibility when we took over the Administration, it was obvious to us that after eliminating the stench of moral decay in the Govern­ment and in our society, the main task was to rescue the economy from the suffocation that choked it to paralyzation, loosen and remove the manacles that impeded its movement, infuse it with vigor and guide it forward. All our multifarious problems spring from the lack of financial sustenance arising from an anemic and unproductive economy. While the Nation has been undergoing a population explosion, the food on the Nation’s table available for distribution for the people’s needs have been too scanty to provide adequately for ail the sectors who are entitled to the essential services of the State. The Government could not repeat the miracle of feeding five thou­sand with five loaves of bread and two fishes. The obvious and indispensable solution to our country’s myriad problems was to develop as rapidly as possible our natural resources in order to increase the food on the Nation’s table, thereby enabling more of our people to partake of the wealth that God has bestowed for the use not of a few but of all.
It was to meet frontally this grave problem that we insti­tuted decontrol and launched the Nation’s integrated five-year socio-economic development program in our first State-of-the-Nation Message to this Congress on January 22, 1962. It will be recalled that the House of Representatives adopted this Program. While the Senate, avowedly for lack of time, did not act on the program, the National Security Council, in which the Senate is represented, has officially adopted the same. The Five-Year Integrated Socio-Economic Development Program, therefore, has become the Nation’s Program. It is your program, as much as it is our own. It is our People’s program. We cited in that program, a three-fold objective, namely:
First, the immediate restoration of economic stability;
Second, the alleviation of the plight of the common man; and
Third, the establishment of a dynamic basis for future growth
Let me review with you what has been done in relation to these three major goals.
ECONOMIC STABILITY
Our first act upon assuming office was to dispel the at­mosphere of uncertainty that pervaded the business commu­nity and discouraged the steady expansion of the country’s productive ventures. On January 21, 1962, as a fundamental and necessary step for stabilizing business conditions and for setting a more rational basis for business plans, we lifted foreign exchange controls. These accomplished two desirable effects: it allowed the exchange rate to be determined by the forces of the free market; and it removed from public au­thorities the power of allocation and control over foreign ex­change funds. The only exceptions were the required sale of twenty per cent of export proceeds to the Central Bank and the settlement of contractual obligations at rates previously agreed upon.
After an anxious supervision of the currency reform, we are now able to declare that the decontrol program has worked out extremely well, with a minimum of adverse repercussions. Fourteen weeks after decontrol was proclaimed, the exchange rate began to stabilize at levels reflective of the real external value of the peso. Since May, the selling rate of commercial banks has kept within the range of P3.87 to P3.92 per U.S. dollar. A new stabilizing factor has emerged with the sub­stantial increases in forward exchange transactions during the last twelve months from $0.26 million in February to $50.41 million in November.
The favorable effects of decontrol have registered them­selves conspicuously. Our export receipts increased by $103 mil­lion over the previous year, while our import bill decreased by $72 million. In contrast to a trade deficit of $144 million in 1961, our external trade accounts showed a surplus of $31 million last year. Our international reserves grew from a level of $103 million at the beginning of the year to $140 million at the end, in spite of the large amount of foreign repayments and of our long term and preferred foreign com­mitments from $341 million to $137 million. Operating receipts of the national government increased by P290 million over those of the past year. The total paid-up capital on new corporate investments rose from P100.6 million in 1961 to P110.3 million in 1962, reflecting an increase of 9.6 per cent. Agricultural production increased by 6.5 per cent in palay alone, and 7.1 per cent for all food crops. Industrial production for the first six months increased by 7.3 per cent.
The year also brought in external developments which will provide us with more resources for future development. The first was the passage by the United States Congress of the War Damage Act, providing for $73 million, which would bolster our balance of payments position. The second was the decision of foreign aid agencies to integrate their aid programs with our own socio-economic program.
Prices
The effect of decontrol on prices was moderate and far less disturbing than what was originally anticipated. In this connection, may we be permitted to correct once and for all the misrepresentation that during the presidential campaign we pledge to lower prices. We did not make any such com­mitment. We could not have made such pledge considering our platform for decontrol. Anyone who persists in claiming that we made this pledge is deliberately, maliciously, and ir­responsibly misleading the people.
Our pledge during the campaign was not to lower the prices but to stop rising prices, which are two different things. This is evidenced by our posters and radio jingles all over the country which cried; “Stop corruption! Stop rising prices!” There was only one commodity the price of which we pledged to lower—and that was rice, the staple food of our people. We have fulfilled this specific pledge and consider­ing that rice is the prime food of our people, we will continue to do everything that is in our power to insure that rice is made available at lower prices at all times within the reach of the masses of our people.
Although it was not our pledge to lower the prices of commodities but to stop their inordinate rise, the objectives of our socio-economic development program once attained will in truth result in the equivalent of lower prices. As the real incomes of our people rise due to increasing production and greater employment, our people will be able to buy more goods because of larger incomes, even though prices may be somewhat higher in peso terms.
Pending the arrival of that stage in our socio-economic development program when income levels will be much higher— and purchasing power correspondingly greater—what is the present situation on prices? Although prices all over the world have been rising, the rise of prices in the Philippines has been so moderate that, according to a world survey made by the Associated Press in November, 1962, prices in the Phil­ippines are second to the lowest in the world. According to this survey, the lowest prices are in the Netherlands, second in the Philippines and third in Egypt and the highest prices are in France, second in Italy and third in the United States. During the past year, the consumer price index increased by 6.7 per cent in Manila and by 4.3 per cent outside Manila. In comparison, after currency reforms in other countries similar to our decontrol, prices increased by 12 per cent in Mexico, 15 per cent in Thailand, 30 per cent in Indonesia, and 102 per cent in Argentina.
This is the important fact; that price levels have been stabilized and real incomes are rising through the increase in production and job opportunities brought about, by our socio-economic development program and the Emergency Em­ployment Administration, Opposition leaders are authority for the thesis that it does not matter if prices in peso terms are rising, as long as the real incomes of the people are also rising. That is exactly what has been done and what will continue to be done: increase jobs and incomes. The incomes of the government personnel, including the armed forces, have been increased. The total increased wages in the public sector amounted to P93 million. Increase of wages in private enter­prises has also been correspondingly taking place. The incomes of the producers, farmers and exporters have been increasing because of the higher peso value of their produce and exports as a result of decontrol. The income of coconut producers alone has increased by P145 million.
One difference between the recent past and the present may be stated to be that in the past, prices continued to rise exorbitantly without hope of relief for the people. At the present time, the people have been assured of rice and corn at lower prices; the prices of other prime commodities have been stabilized; and there is not only hope but legitimate ex­pectation that with the passage of time the quantity of goods and services will so increase and incomes will so rise that prices will be well within the reach of our people.
The achievement of relative price stability was due in large measure to the increase in domestic production and to the operations of the Rice and Corn Administration and the NAMARCO. A major stabilizing factor was the observ­ance of monetary and fiscal prudence on the part of the Ad­ministration as a precautionary measure incident to decontrol in order to forestall speculation, to keep the exchange rate in rein, and to cushion the excessive monetary expansion per­petrated in 1961.
Credit
As an initial step incident to decontrol, credit was tightened by the Central Bank, but credit restrictions were relaxed from the second quarter on. The liberalization of credit was made permissible by the stability of the exchange rate and the exercise of fiscal responsibility. If complaints of money tight­ness continued to be raised, the reason was largely statutory rather than regulatory for the lending capacity of several banks had hit the limit imposed by law on the ratio of their net worth to their risk assets. In order to expand credit in the scope that will be helpful and non-inflationary, legis­lation is necessary, as will hereafter be proposed.
Fiscal discipline was achieved by keeping government spend­ing from unduly expanding and by increasing revenue collec­tions. The broadening of the tax base as a consequence of the change of value of the peso and the intensification of customs and internal revenue collections improved the fiscal position of the Government. The result was the generation of a cash surplus of P159 million during the second half of FY 1962 to offset partially the cash deficit of P246 million incurred during the first half under the previous administration. Thus, the over-all cash deficit incurred in the first six months of the fiscal year was reduced by P87 million, after repaying the obligation incurred by the past administration to the Central Bank in the sum of P100 million. During the first calendar year of our Administration, we achieved a cash surplus of P16 million as compared to a deficit of P215 million in the corresponding period of 1961.
The use of monetary and fiscal instruments for the preser­vation of stability after decontrol was complemented by a set of specific commercial policies to protect and encourage local industries. As a result of investigations made by the Tariff Commission and the National Economic Council, we revised the tariff schedules in January and June last year and again in January, this year to accord more protection to do­mestic producers of essential commodities, particularly textiles. These modifications embraced over 200 domestic industries employing about 40,000 persons.
We also took positive measures through the Department of Finance to counteract the dumping of certain subsidized foreign products such as black iron, galvanized iron pipes, and truck tires and tubes. Had these not been imposed, some of the moat essential industries operating in the Philippines would have been adversely affected.
The foregoing steps taken were, among the many efforts undertaken, in cognizance of the temporary disruptions which inevitably accompany a major shift in the fundamental pattern of our economy. The removal of artificial market structures, the elimination of windfall exchange profits, the placing of entrepreneurs on a free competitive basis—all these had to be achieved in the soonest possible time with the least possible dislocation.
Full Decontrol
It is desirable to effect full decontrol by providing a substi­tute for the 20 per cent retention of dollar export receipts by the Central Bank. Such step will pave the way of the early establishment of a fixed par value for the peso which will provide greater incentives to exports, facilitate long-range plan­ning and greater inflow of foreign investment. A substitute measure would yield more revenues to the Government than the 20 per cent retention scheme the proceeds of which do not entirely accrue to the National Government but merely places the Central Bank in a position to support the Government expenditure program in an amount equivalent to the peso rights accruing to the Bank from the 20 per cent requirement.
The substitute source of revenue should not fall indiscrimi­nately on all exports because this would go against one of the objectives of decontrol which is to stimulate the develop­ment of new and specially processed and manufactured export goods. The impost should bear mostly on exported raw ma­terials and should exclude manufactured goods. An untaxed raw material export is a burden on domestic processors, who have to pay domestic sales taxes and a subsidy to foreign labor and capital, thus fomenting unfair competition against our processed exports.
WELFARE OF THE COMMON MAN
The Administration has unequivocally committed itself to the mission of alleviating the plight of the common man. It is explicitly one of the major goals of the Socio-Economic Program that the less fortunate masses are provided a larger and increasing portion of the Nation’s economic and social benefits, and that the transition to a free market is done as helpfully as possible to the common people.
Toward this end, we have implemented various measures primarily designed to make available the basic economic neces­sities of food, shelter and clothing to the masses at prices they can afford.
Rice and Corn
One of the major problems which we have sought to elimi­nate has been the recurring shortages in our staple foods. Since the enactment of Republic Act No. 3452 creating the Rice and Corn Administration (RCA) last June, we are pleased to state that the rice crisis, which had been persistently plaguing our economy and which necessitated the importations of rice, particularly in 1961, is now an event of the past. To be more specific, in 1961 it cost our people P60 million in rice importa­tion without solving the problem; in 1962, without importation, it cost the RCA only P1.5 million while paying Pll.50 per cavan of 45 kilos of palay to the rice growers and distributing rice at P0.85 to P0.95 per ganta to the consumers.
As a result of its operations, the RCA has been able to accomplish, with exceptional success, the primary objective of not only stabilizing the price of rice and corn, but also providing the necessary incentives to our farmers to produce more of these staple foods by offering them a fair and just return for their produce. Since the last harvest, the RCA has embarked on massive palay procurement operations. It is now operating about 150 warehouses throughout the country with an aggregate capacity of six million cavans of palay. In addition, the RCA operates over one hundred mills capable of processing 10,000 cavans of rice daily.
The National Economic Council has estimated a surplus of over eight million sacks of palay by the end of the current crop year.
In conjunction with the operations of the RCA, the Rice and Corn Board has actively implemented the Rice and Corn Nationalization Law in accordance with the law’s spirit and intention.
In the success achieved by the RCA in coping with the rice problem, acknowledgment is due not only the adminis­tration leaders in Congress but likewise the opposition leaders who cooperated fully with the rice and corn program of the Administration, particularly Senate President Eulogio Rodriguez and former Speaker Daniel Romualdez.
The spectacular success that has been attained in solving the rice problem and avoiding the recurrent rice crisis, which was achieved with the help of leaders of the Opposition, is an indication of what real cooperation between the Adminis­tration and the Opposition can accomplish to help our people in their difficulties. We keep on praying that in the midst of our partisan strife, the light of Divine inspiration will one day illumine our minds and hearts in order to persuade us on both sides to cast away our differences and in a mag­nificent moment of national solidarity act in unison to solve successfully together the problems that are working hardships on our people.
Fish
Having coped with the problem of providing rice to our people, we moved to develop the fish industry in order to complete the components of the food of our people—rice and fish. Toward this end, the Emergency Employment Adminis­tration (EEA) has worked out a P15 million fishery develop­ment project with the Bureau of Fisheries, which is expected to increase fish production within five years by about P45 million annually. This fishery project includes, among others, the establishment of twenty stationary fishing nets in coastal provinces and fishing grounds, and the construction of sixteen fishing ports as well as refrigeration stations in strategic coastal provinces.
Prime Commodities
To cushion the increased procurement costs of imported prime commodities in 1962, we created, with the cooperation of the leaders of the Opposition, a bipartisan Technical Com­mittee on Prices last July for the purpose of studying and recommending measures which would best achieve the stabili­zation of the prices of prime commodities at reasonable levels.
In accordance with the Committee’s recommendations, the NAMARCO has been importing, since July of last year, the net national requirements for milk, sardines and corned beef, and selling them through its outlets at landed costs. As a result of this intensive program of importation by the NA­MARCO, the prices of imported prime commodities have been stabilized at prices within the reach of the masses.
On the basis of the findings and recommendations, of the Secretary of Health, the Administration imported over half-a-million pesos worth of life-saving drugs. The direct im­portation of life-saving drugs is a temporary measure during the period of transition which is intended mainly to provide relief to the masses who still cannot afford to pay for these prime drugs. We wish to commend our domestic drug manu­facturers for maintaining pre-decontrol price levels.
The Administration realized that certain industries in the private sector could be affected by the NAMARCO’s importa­tion program. Consequently, steps were taken to limit the items imported by NAMARCO and slowly shift activities to­ward promoting the increasing acceptance by Filipino consumers of locally-made articles. The NAMARCO has started to embark on an extensive program of procuring, distributing and merchandising locally-produced goods.
Moreover, the Department of Commerce and Industry has taken steps to encourage local investors to establish whole milk factories, meat and fish canneries in order to lessen and eventually eliminate our dependence on imported prime com­modities. The response of the private sector has been gratify­ing. By the first half of this year, we look forward to the operation of a whole milk factory, and in the near future, the establishment of fish and meat canneries which will eventually render the NAMARCO importations of prime commodities unnecessary.
Shelter
Next to food, steps have been taken to provide the people with adequate shelter. The administration is striving hard to rectify the deplorable housing conditions of the masses. Toward this goal, bids have recently been opened for the construction of a P3 million multi-storey tenement project in Tondo as the first phase in the Administration’s massive housing program for the poor. Two other housing projects have been scheduled for construction in other Manila districts and one in Makati. The program calls for the construction of similar multi-storey tenements in urban sites in the provinces. We hope that through this program of making available decent dwellings at reasonable costs to the low-wage earners, the situation wherein the poorest of our people will be adequately housed and sheltered will become a reality in the immediate future.
Clothing
Having taken steps to provide our people with food and shelter, measures were likewise undertaken to provide them with clothing. In order to make adequate clothing available to the masses, we launched, with the cooperation of the Textile Mills Association, a program for the production and distribution of a low-cost, durable cotton material known as the “Pag-Asa” cloth which costs P0.95 a yard for men and P0.65 a yard for women, ex-factory. Through this program, we hope to fulfill the objective of the low-income people being adequately yet inexpensively clothed,
Income
The program to provide our people with their essential need in food, shelter and clothing would be futile unless we give them an opportunity to earn the income with which to quire these needs. Our first step in this direction was to increase the income of the wage-earners. Republic Act No. 3500 which was enacted last year created a Salary Adjustment Fund amounting to P16.2 million. From this fund, we effected, an increase of at least ten pesos a month in the salaries of approximately 91,000 government employees.
Employment 
The next step was immediately to provide the people with employment while awaiting the creation of job opportunities private enterprises as envisioned in the five-year socio-economic development program. To achieve our goal of pro­viding maximum employment opportunities in public economic development projects, the EEA embarked last November on a nation-wide program with the immediate aim of alleviating the deplorable state of unemployment and underemployment in the country.
The bulk of the projects undertaken by the EEA are in the nature of productive public works such as the construc­tion, improvement, and repair of roads and highways, find irrigation projects throughout the rural areas.
Mention has already been made of the EEA large-scale fishery project. In the field of handicraft industries, the EEA has recruited and trained the necessary labor for the National Cottage Industries Administration (NACIDA) according to the latter’s standards and specifications.
The EEA is also actively supplementing the program of the Bureau of Agricultural Extension through the tapping of fresh agriculture graduates and their assignment to various municipalities and barrios lacking extension workers. One of the requirements for agricultural extension workers, which is an improvement of the past practice, is for them to reside in the barrios.
In coordination with the National Resettlement and Reha­bilitation Administration (NARRA), the EEA has embarked on twelve projects for the clearing of land and the construction of feeder roads encompassing a total area of 20,000 hectares. Furthermore, it has undertaken intensive work in forest con­servation and reforestation together with the Bureau of Forestry.
University for Workers
In our mission to build a better future for the common man, we did not confine ourselves to helping him acquire the food, shelter and clothing that he needs, and the income with which to obtain such needs. We proceeded to open an additional and special opportunity for his children to attain a higher success than was possible for their elders. It is in this spirit that the Administration launched the establishment of a Labor University in Makati, Rizal, which will provide the common man with the opportunity to aspire for greater achievements through the acquisition and development of the necessary skills required by our expanding economy.
Workers as Proprietors
In addition to opportunities to have food, shelter, clothing, income and higher education, we likewise opened the oppor­tunity to the common man to become a proprietor and to be­come acclimated to the responsibilities of such station. It was for this purpose that the Administration sold the National Development Company textile mills in Manila to the labor unions. This bold experiment, which is an unprecedented case in Philippine labor history, is a manifestation of our pro­found desire to improve the lot of the common people. Should the workers succeed in this epochal grant of opportunity to them to become proprietors, the gates of similar oppor­tunity will be opened wider in other disposable government enterprises.
Abolition of Tenancy
Having passed successfully through the crucial period of transition from a controlled economy to free enterprise, it is time that decisive action be taken to effect the now long-delayed land reform. Land being our most valuable resources, salutary changes is imperative in the land system. Our agricultural productivity has tended to be static; farm incomes have re­mained below subsistence level.
The most basic cause of this failure is the land tenure system. About one-half of our farmers remain share-croppers, perpetually in debt to landowners who not infrequently are non-resident landowners. So long as this condition persists, agricultural development will be sluggish. The structure of agriculture needs to be recast before any appreciable growth in productivity and incomes can be possible.
The Land Reform Act of 1955 has failed to bring about significant changes. Still intact is the tenancy system which tends to perpetuate traditional farm methods as it provides no incentive for greater production. Under this system, in­creases in yield through scientific farming accrue mostly to the landowners. On the other hand, for his extra effort and investment a tenant receives less than one-fourth of the net proceeds from improved farm practices. The inevitable result is apathy among tenants towards more productive farm techniques.
We must now confront the land problem with the realism, courage and boldness that the situation demands. We must no longer stall or equivocate. The time has come to abolish tenancy in our farms.
We should replace tenancy with owner-cultivator ship with due regard to the just rights of the former landlord. As a people who take pride in freedom as a way of life, we must now do away with tenancy which has become the centuries-old tattoo of economic slavery and social degradation for the man who tills the farm. We must establish a new and economically-sound set-up in which the former tenant will be­come a dignified participant in bringing forth the productivity of the good earth. We must give the tenants liberty from economic peonage, in which they have long languished, so that they will become free men who will share with dignity in the task of building the Nation.
In doing this and in setting up the tenant farmers as in­dependent landowners, we shall release tremendous productive energies that will boost economic and social development. We shall release large capital resources tied up in absentee land­lordism to business and industry. We shall set our tenants free from poverty and debt.
An over-all program to abolish tenancy, as well as to assist farm laborers and wage earners, the free settlers of public land and farmers owning private land of less than family size, will bring about an overdue readjustment of our social struc­ture; it will correct the present imbalance in our society, where there are enormous concentrations of land, wealth and political power in the hands of a few. It will set loose the energies of millions, put new life in the rural areas, and raise pro­ductivity, mass income and purchasing power. Not least, the land reform program will make democracy truly meaningful to our people.
Labor
In addition to the specific measures we have implemented to cushion the lot of the common man during the transition to a decontrolled economy, it would be well to mention the services of those government agencies primarily concerned with our people’s welfare.
As industrial peace is essential to the nation’s economic growth, the Administration’s policy is to promote labor-manage­ment cooperation concomitant with the growth of free and responsible trade unions. The Department of Labor has been increasingly active in the role of arbitrator and conciliator for both Labor and Management. With the Department’s active assistance, around four hundred collective bargaining agree­ments were signed and close to three hundred other agreements adjusting grievances were reached.
We have commenced action against unscrupulous labor leaders in order to protect labor from exploitation from their own ranks. It is hoped that the limited action we have taken in this regard will sufficiently promote responsible labor leader­ship for the well-being of the workers and that, toward this end; it shall not become necessary to expand deterrent measures.
At the same time, the Administration successfully extended the protection of the law to farm workers, particularly in the sugar industry.
Labor-management frictions are bound to arise especially in a growing economy, as evidenced by the occurrence of labor strikes which spurred undue excitement last year. It may be pertinent to note, however, that while over 32 per cent of the strike notices filed with the Labor Department in 1961 matured into strikes, the comparative figure for 1962 was only 17 per cent, a figure almost twice less than that for 1961.
Education
Basic to the efforts toward economic expansion and the growth of social benefits to the common man is the proper education of the citizenry. It was toward this objective that the Department of Education formulated policies and imple­mented measures to improve the quality of instruction and to strengthen the curricula in all levels of instruction. Thus, during the past year, 13,000 new classes were opened by the Department of Education on the elementary level as compared to 10,300 new classes opened during 1961.
Health
Through the Department of Health, the Administration directed intensive efforts toward the prevention, if not the total elimination, of the diseases and epidemics which threaten the health of our people.
When we assumed the burden of handling the people’s affairs the most pressing problem of health which confronted us was the raging El Tor epidemic. Through the aggressive implementation of health control measures, the authorities were able, within a short period of time, to contain the epidemic.
In the same manner, we have acted vigorously to meet a possi­ble smallpox threat from abroad by ensuring an adequate supply of vaccine through importation.
The Health Department has expanded its rural health units with the establishment of 33 additional ones, while expansion of hospital services was achieved through the completion of 31 hospitals with a total capacity of 1,050 beds.
Social Welfare
The Social Welfare Administration, for its part, has un­dertaken the construction of a Regional Vocational Rehabilita­tion Training Center for the blind and other physically handicapped. Moreover, it has implemented creditably Republic Act No, 3467 which created a Calamity Fund of P14 million for the rehabilitation of some 45,000 families who suffered in the floods and typhoons that ravaged the country early last year. Material aid valued at P250.000 was extended to some 64,000 destitute families. The political factor in the dis­tribution of relief by the SWA has been virtually eliminated.
A regular committee on relief has been created headed by the Executive Secretary and the Social Welfare Adminis­trator. This has made possible the instantaneous ministration of relief in the event of calamities.
BASIS FOR GROWTH
Aside from attending to the pressing problems of restoring stability to the economy and providing for the immediate needs of the people, we addressed our efforts to the third goal of the nation’s socio-economic program of providing a dynamic basis for the future growth of our economy.
Upon adoption of the Integrated Five-Year Socio-Economic Program, which aims at increasing our gross domestic product over the five-year period at a compound rate of 6%, we es­tablished the technical staff for translating this basic program into action. We started the operation of this machinery for the implementation of the Program without delay.
Implementation
The machinery that we set up for implementing the Pro­gram was in consonance with a basic philosophy that should bear on all government decision-making: that all the public resources at the disposal of the Government shall be pro­grammed and allocated carefully and efficiently and concentrated on projects that contribute most substantially to the country’s productivity. Our procedure departs radically from the past methods of wastefully allocating the government’s capital funds in a haphazard, uncoordinated and dissipated and often political fashion, resulting in the forfeiture of the large benefits the country could have obtained had they been pro­grammed more rationally and imaginatively.
In addition to creating new bodies, we have revitalized existing agencies and rapidly transformed them into effective executive arms for implementing our economic program.
Thus, the integrated Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Program is now underway. The Government is now financing a set of capital and development projects under a special three-month master budget which we have drawn up within existing authorizations for the purpose of continuing or com­pleting those existing projects that have immediate priority in terms of the requirements of the over-all Program. These projects are now being undertaken by the Department of Public Works and Communications, National Power Corporation, NAWASA and other appropriate government agencies.
The implementation of the Program will require the con­tinuous construction of fixed and lasting facilities, on the part of the private and the public sector, for the production of necessary goods and services. In the private sector, these facilities include new farms and farm improvements, new factories, and more mining facilities. In the public sector, they include those basic overhead facilities such as roads and bridges without which the private sector can not advance.
The Public Sector
In the public sector, the Government has the responsibility of using its resources wisely and imaginatively to build, as permanent structures, the social capital necessary for the coun­try’s growth. We accept this in order to stress the long-term nature of our undertaking, to underscore the need for legislative cooperation, and to emphasize the need of concentrating the government efforts and finances on integrated and long-term projects, rather than spreading them thinly on activities that may give the impression of immediate accomplishment but contribute little to lasting social productivity.
The Private Sector
In the private sector, the Government’s efforts in imple­menting the over-all economic program will be to facilitate the growth of private enterprise. The specific projects that we have scheduled during these five years in the field of trans­port, communications, and allied public services are aimed at providing the private sector with the facilities which it needs in order to establish and expand its productive ventures. It is the responsibility of the Government to formulate and execute policies that would establish the proper climate, as well as to provide a framework of legal and administrative precepts that would attract the private sector into channeling its resources into those enterprises that are most desirable from the national viewpoint.
The promotion of high-priority private industries under a system of free enterprise is the most challenging task that faces the Government. It is a task that demands imagination, sensitivity to the businessman’s problems and goals, and de­dication. Indicative of the prospect of successfully meeting this responsibility, we are happy to report to Congress that no less than P1,060,000,000 in new ventures have been formalized in 1962 and that work on these enterprises has begun.
One of the basic reasons for dismantling exchange controls was to provide a more stable, rational and realistic basis for the formulation of business plans, in place of the artificial attractions created by the controlled rates in favor of industries that were highly dependent on imported materials. Accord­ingly, we have established the proper climate for encouraging more ventures into the following basic fields: steel; the fabri­cation of metal products, including machinery and appliances; basic chemical and fertilizer; glass and cement; veneer and plywood; pulp-making; food processing and packing; and allied industries.
With the end in view of laying a basis for the future growth of domestic industries in wholesome directions, the Government has spent the past year in preparing and estab­lishing the machinery for assisting these industries along two principal lines: first, in the area of project development; and second, in the area of financing.
In the area of project development, we have taken measures to help industrialists in the difficult process of preparing and planning for ventures in which the country has had little experience. Among others, we have concluded arrangements with the Agency for International Development (AID) to cooperate with the Philippine government in establishing in this country on a long-term basis, an office of technical men from abroad with extensive experience in the engineering, financial, eco­nomic and market planning of projects. Their main function will be to assure the soundness of projects that local businessmen are planning to undertake, and make them acceptable for financing by foreign institutions were necessary. We have also charged the Department of Commerce and Industry with the task of serving as the clearing house of business problems and of minimizing, if not eliminating, the thousand and one bottlenecks in obsolete government procedures and requirements which have been left over from a decade of controls.
We have also readied ourselves to take positive steps to encourage and provide the proper climate for savings and investment among the small people, so that the opportunities and rewards offered by industrialization and economic growth will be extended to them not only as workers but as owners as well.
Private Industrial Development Bank
In the area of financing, in fulfillment of a plan announced in our message last year, the Government has pushed through the establishment of the Private Development Corporation of the Philippines, which will mobilize and provide the long-term capital which industries of the future will need. The Corpo­ration will start operations within the first quarter of this year with total investible funds of P112.5 million including $15 million which will be contributed by the World Bank, P7.5 million from fifteen foreign banks, and P27.5 million by the Department of National Defense in collaboration with the AID. It is hoped that the AID will make up to our military organization this appreciation for the priority of our eco­nomic progress by using its good offices to augment future military assistance to our military forces.
We have reoriented the lending policies of the government financial institutions such as the DBP, the GSIS and the SSS in order to give priority to the intermediate and basic industries which we seek to establish in the near future.
Foreign Investments
We are gratified that in the past year, keen interest has been shown by businessmen in America, Europe and other parts of the world for the investment opportunities in the country which were opened by the Administration’s policy of private enterprise. We must continue in an even more vigorous manner to welcome foreign capital and investments in. our country. Domestic capital is inadequate to sustain economic enterprises to the extent and magnitude required for the needs of our fast-growing population. Foreign capital, preferably in joint ventures with Filipinos, is needed and will be welcome in our country within the foreseeable future. As our Administration protects Filipino investors, it guarantees to foreign capital and investors fair treatment, and warrants against confiscation and expropriation. We also allow full repatriation of profits as well as capital.
With the foregoing integrated and coordinated measures, we feel confident that we shall have laid the groundwork for a balanced developing economy.
FOREIGN AFFAIRS
Notwithstanding the preferential attention that we have given to moral regeneration and economic growth, we have accorded due attention to all other public services. We pause now to present what the Administration has undertaken in vital fields of government although attending to all respon­sibilities to the people.
With the avowed aim of raising the level of our inter­national prestige, reforms have been carried out in the Depart­ment of Foreign Affairs in order to safeguard and enhance the career service. The political prostitution of the Foreign Service has been firmly resisted.
Philippine-American Relations
With respect to our vital relations with the United States, we are happy to state that we are forging closer ties with the former mother country within the framework of political and economic developments. The approval by the U.S. Con­gress of the $73 million war damage claim has done much toward closer understanding of the mutual problems confronting both countries, and has reaffirmed our faith and confidence in the sense of fairness of the American people. We are elated that the United States has increased the Philippine sugar quota, thus ensuring higher export earnings for the sugar industry and additions to our international reserves.
Philippine-American relations are closest since the found­ing of the Republic. No major problems exist between the two countries. We are gratified at the convincing readiness of the American Government to assist our country in every practicable way in meeting our problems. On our part, as shown by our position in the Cuban crisis, we stand ready to stand by the United States as the leader of the free world in any crisis involving our common security and the defense of mutual ideals and interests.
Other Countries
Closer dealings have been promoted with Asian countries to a point where our neighbors have been keener than in the past to have collaborative efforts with the Philippines for common benefit and in the interest of the region. More­over, closer relations have developed with other countries, par­ticularly with Spain. Steps have been taken to establish on a clear and stable basis the broad relations between the Philip­pines and Japan and the adjustment of long-pending problems between the Republic of China and this country.
Communism
In the context of the cold war, the Philippines had firmly aligned itself against Communism. There have been some questions raised about our uncompromising stand on the matter, but we cannot afford to succumb to the ever-present temptation to relax on our stand. Although we strive so earnestly for economic progress such ideal will be futile if our free and democratic way of life is subverted and lost through lack of vigilance.
The Administration has accordingly maintained relentless vigilance in combating the infiltration of communism in vital sectors of the Government and our society. Through our suc­ceeding program of economic and social progress under the aegis of democracy, the communist enemy is being pushed into retreat and defeat.
The vigorous peace and order campaign launched by the Philippine Constabulary last year, which laid emphasis on intelligence operations in coordination with other intelligence and police agencies, resulted in the capture of three top communist leaders in Quezon City last July, and in the sur­render of Benjamin Cunanan alias Commander Hizon in Arayat, Pampanga.
The Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces was respon­sible for the arrest last May of twelve staff members of the Chinese Commercial News which is suspected of being the propaganda organ of the Chinese Communist Party. Intense and thorough intelligence operations also brought about the discovery of Political Transmission No. 17, a subversive docu­ment of the Chinese Communist Party.
North Borneo Claim
The most important action taken in the field of foreign relations in the past year was the official filing on June 22, 1962 with the United Kingdom of the Philippine claim of sovereignty, jurisdiction and proprietory ownership over North Borneo as successor-in-interest of the Sultan of Sulu. We are gratified at the good will shown by the United Kingdom in holding the talks in London in pursuance of our note on June 22, 1962, in which talk an opportunity has been opened for a friendly scrutiny of the Philippine claim, taken with the security problems of Southeast Asia.
Contrary to allegations in some political quarters, this was not a precipitate action. We have personally studied this claim over a period of years. While serving in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1946, upon a study of this claim in connec­tion with our successful negotiation for the reacquisition of the Turtle Islands, we advocated the filing of this claim.
In 1948, while serving in the Philippine Embassy in Wash­ington, DC, we went over the claim with an American expert in Anglo-Saxon law in George Washington University who sustained the view that this is a valid claim. When we served in the Congress of the Philippines, we successfully authored and sponsored in 1950, a resolution for the filing of this claim. Upon becoming President of the Philippines, acting on the conviction that this was not only a valid claim but that its presentation was demanded by the national interest, it became our inescapable duty to act on the bipartisan resolution of the House of Representatives on April 24, 1962, that the claim be filed now or never.
The situation is that the Philippines not only have a valid and historic claim to North Borneo. In addition, the pursuit of the claim is itself vital to our national security. We could not merely view the placing of North Borneo under Malaya, without presentation and consideration of our legitimate claim to North Borneo. Our claim to North Borneo cannot be less than the claim of Malaya to the territory not only on the basis of superior juridical and historic rights but in the vital in­terest of our national security.
Malaya has no valid claim or right to take over North Borneo. Furthermore, if through arbitrary arrangement, the Borneo territory is placed under Malaya, the latter cannot likely insure for long the security of North Borneo for the free world. A profound and farsighted contemplation of the present and potential security posture in the whole region will conclusively support the judgment that the restoration of North Borneo as part of the territory of the Philippines would be the durable measure that could best insure against territorial disequilibrium and restlessness in the area and could constitute the firm and stabilizing factor to maintain and safeguard the security of the region.
The project to place North Borneo, together with Brunei and Sarawak, under Malaya has already provoked a revolt in Brunei. It can be expected that Indonesia will not settle down accepting the authority of Malaya over Sarawak, Brunei and North Borneo. Moreover, the proposed Federation of Malaysia is not in accordance with the principle of self-determination, which is the accepted way out of colonialism, but appears to be a continuation of colonialism baaed only on an expedient of false security.
It was imperative that the Philippine claim be, as it was, made because if North Borneo was not to be by itself inde­pendent but was to be placed under another state there is no valid reason why, with the legal and historic bases of .the Philippine claim, and considering that North Borneo is con­tiguous to Philippine territory and vital to our security, the new State to be given jurisdiction over North Borneo should not be the Philippines.
It is vital to the security of the Philippines that North Borneo be not placed under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of another state, particularly a state on the Asian mainland like Malaya. In the event, God forbid, that Malaya succumbs to the potent communist threat on the Asian mainland, with North Borneo under Malaya, there would be created a situation in which a communist territory would be immediately at the southern frontier of the Philippines, which would pose a grave and intolerable threat to our country. Against such a threat, we know that our people will fight to the death, for they will rather die fighting for freedom than live in slavery.
Principle of Self-Determination
In laying claim to North Borneo in pursuance of the legal and historic rights and the security interests of the Philip­pines, we recognize the cardinal principle of self-determination of which the Philippines has been a steadfast adherent. In the prosecution, of our valid claim, it is agreeable to us that at an appropriate time, the people of North Borneo should be given an opportunity to determine whether they would wish to be independent or whether they would wish to be a part of the Philippines or be placed under another state. Such re­ferendum, however, should be authentic and bona fide by holding it under conditions, preferably supervised by the United Na­tions that would insure effective freedom to the people of North Borneo to express their true and enlightened will.
ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE
Aside from providing the striking force in the Administra­tion’s relentless campaign against graft and corruption, the Department of Justice implemented measures to insure the independence of the judiciary and to attain a speedy and im­partial administration of justice.
In order to ease the congestion in the dockets of our courts, .the Justice Department brought about the filling of the sixty-two existing vacancies in the courts of first instance with men of proven ability and integrity. A closer degree of supervision was exercised over the courts. In order to enable them to discharge their duties promptly and correctly, the Department has taken measures to ensure that the courts are furnished with sufficient personnel, supplies and copies of requisite ju­dicial materials.
The Department is readying reform proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary and promote speedy and less expensive litigations for the consideration of a Constitu­tional Convention to amend the fundamental law, if and when the same is convened.
Constitutional Amendments 
Multiple and meritorious proposals for amending the consti­tution have been made over a period of years. Moreover, there is need for improving the administrative machinery in order to make the Government more efficient and effective in dis­charging its functions for the welfare of the people. Similarly, the courts, below the Supreme Court require improvement to bolster judicial independence, to make litigations less tedious and expensive and to generally improve the administration of justice, particularly as it affects the common people who cannot afford long and expensive litigations. Likewise, there is need of decentralizing .our government and increasing the authority and responsibility of the provincial, municipal and barrio governments.
These imperative judicial and administrative reforms can­not, however, be attained in a manner as to be effective, just and permanently conducive to public welfare unless they are based on constitutional foundations which will provide for a synchronized and well-balanced, as contrasted with a lopsided and harmful allocation of governmental powers. They should be undertaken only on the basis of constitutional changes which will make possible a synchronized allocation of legislative, executive and judicial powers for the attainment of the best interest of the people.
It is, therefore, imperative that a constitutional convention be called to consider multifarious proposals for the amend­ment of the Constitution. Moreover, inasmuch as the present fundamental law partakes of the nature of a colonial consti­tution in the sense that it was adopted during the time of the Commonwealth and that it could not take effect without the approval of the President of another country, it is desirable to update it in consonance with the fresh spirit of constructive nationalism that invigorates our Nation and which prefers that our fundamental law be not one for an unindependent commonwealth but a Constitution for our free Republic as the expres­sion and embodiment of the true and exclusive will of our sovereign people.
There is an unassailable principle, in connection with amend­ing the Constitution, that the farther the constitutional con­vention is convoked from the next presidential election, the greater the objectivity that will be attained in the consideration and approval of a constitutional change. Unless, therefore, Congress convokes a constitutional convention in this session, the constitutional, judicial and administrative reforms so pa­tently demanded by the national well-being may be well de­ferred indefinitely.
Electoral Reform
To strengthen our democracy and bolster the effective exer­cise of the political rights of the people, we must decisively undertake electoral reforms in this session of Congress which could be applied in this year’s local elections. Action on this matter has long been overdue. These electoral measures should effectively reduce and eliminate election frauds and irregular­ities which tend to defeat the popular will and reduce campaign expenses to the minimum in order to expand the chances of meritorious but unmoneyed citizens to be elevated to elective public office and leadership. The reduction of election expenses to the minimum necessary to conduct a reasonable campaign will also serve to curb corruption because it would do away with the need for candidates to receive contributions from parties who seek government favors.
NATIONAL SECURITY
In the field of national defense, a drastic modification in the plans of the Armed Forces of the Philippines was effected in order to make its activities more responsive to actual conditions such as the modernization of equipment and weapons, and in conformity with the Government’s financial ability to meet the requirements of internal security and the commit­ments for mutual assistance with other countries.
Among the measures taken along the lines of internal se­curity were the following:
(a) The modernization of the Philippine Air Force through the acquisition of jet aircraft and helicopters.
(b) The vigorous work culminating in the capture of top-echelon dissidents and bandits and the surrender of loose fire-arms.
(c) The creation of task forces to carry out peace and order and wage campaigns against blast fishing, kaingin, cattle rustling and smuggling.
We have taken measures to restore and bolster the morale of our armed forces. Among the steps taken were to enforce the retirement and other laws without favoritism and discriminations; the application of the criteria of merit, seniority and justice in appointments, promotions and assignments of army officers; increase of pay for both enlisted men and officers; and a housing program for enlisted men.
We must continue the effort to maintain and bolster the morale of our military organization and to place its various services in tip-top shape in view of their valuable service in our domestic problems of security and socio-economic effort, as well as the growing responsibilities of the Republic on the international scene. Measures should be sought in order to enable the armed forces to maintain itself efficiently and to be provided with its essential needs.
Peace and Order
Attention was given in the past year to the maintenance of peace and order by the police authorities and the Armed Forces.
The Department of National Defense has vigorously waged campaigns against smuggling, illegal fishing, prostitution, nar­cotics, gambling, illegal logging and carnapping, resulting in 1he prosecution of over 2,700 cases and the apprehension of over 24,000 persons.
“Not What is Popular, But What is Good for the People”
We must emphasize that in 1963, the improvement of the rate of economic growth shall be the main objective of our vigorous and sustained efforts. In the final analysis, it will be the resulting and solid economic foundation that will bring about the lasting benefits to our people.
This is a time of supreme challenge for all of us. To push through to advantage the gains made in the Nation’s economic effort, we are called upon to adopt implementory measures that are unprecedented in magnitude. Half-measures will not now suffice. Half-measures will only endanger the success of the critical endeavor to attain an adequate degree of economic and social progress which our people urgently need and which, if we act courageously and patriotically, is now within their reach.
It is a supreme challenge to our courage and patriotism because some of these measures may not be momentarily palat­able to the very people whom we seek to serve. The remedies are of the nature of medicine which is not instantly agreeable to the patient but which he must take for his good. They are measures which, heretofore, being politically disadvantageous, we should not even consider. So this is a time of test which will show who among us are sheer politicians and who are sincere public servants and statesmen. The test will be whether one will refrain or will courageously support those measures needed for the success of our economic program and for the good of the economy and the country but which may not be instantly popular with segments of the people. For those who are faithful to the country and those who are sterling leaders of the people and statesmen, there can be no choice except to support what is needed for the attainment of our goal of rapid economic growth and social progress despite momentary dis­approval from the public. To the true public servant and the statesman, there is only one duty—to do with courage not what is popular, but what is good for the people.
RECOMMENDATIONS
In the light of the foregoing, we respectfully recommend to Congress the following:
First, that the economic measures submitted in last year’s session and which were not passed be now enacted, namely:
(1) Further amendment of R. A. No. 85, providing for the charter of the Development Bank of the Philippines, in order to increase the DBP’s authorized capitalization to P2 billion.
(2) Amendment of R. A. No. 3127, known as the Basic Industries Act, in order to limit the application of tax benefits to industries which can properly be denominated as basic and which require some form of incentives in order to attract investors.
(3) The formal adoption by the Senate of the Integrated Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Program.
(4) A full decontrol measure as a substitute for the 20 per cent retention of dollar export receipts being made by the Central Bank.
(5) An investment incentives law for the encouragement of foreign capital, as well as domestic investments,
Second, that the resolution which we submitted in the previous session for the calling of a constitutional convention be now approved.
Third, that the bill submitted in the last session for the creation of a Moral Commission be enacted into law.
Fourth, that a bill be enacted to effect land reform, includ­ing the abolition of tenancy and assistance to farm laborers or wage-earners, the free settlers of public land and farmers owning private land of less than family size.
Fifth, that legislation is enacted to bring about electoral reforms that would reduce campaign expenses to the minimum and curb election frauds.
Sixth, that legislation is enacted to revise the tax structure and amend the Revised Internal Revenue Code in order to provide for a more equitable assessment of taxes based on ability to pay and to raise revenues to support the vital phases of the Nation’s socio-economic development program.
Seventh, that other economic measures be adopted which are essential to the proper implementation of the Nation’s socio-economic development program, namely:
(6) Amendment of R.A. No. 337, known as the General Banking Act, in order to expand credit facilities by granting greater flexibility to the operations of commercial banks and enable them more effectively to support their functions of extending short-term loans.
(7) Amendment of R.A. No. 1937, the Tariff and Customs Code, providing for authority of the President to modify tariff duties in order to extend and expand the authority in duration and scope granted to the President under Section 402 of the Tariff and Customs Code.
(8) Amendment of R.A. 1000, entitled “An Act Author­izing the President of the Philippines to Issue Bonds to Finance Public Works and Projects for Economic Development, Author­ized by Law, and for other purposes” in order to expand the Government’s borrowing authority to enable it to support more fully the Government’s investment program.
(9) Amendment of R.A. No. 16 entitled “An Act author­izing the President of the Philippines to obtain such Loans or incur such Indebtedness with the Government of the United States, etc.” in order to expand the Government’s authority to procure funds for economic development.
(10) Amendment of R.A. No. 529, entitled “An Act to Assure Uniform Value of Philippine Coin and Currency” in order to allow maximum incentives for the entry of foreign funds.
(11) A law creating a Fisheries Commission which shall foster the development, improvement, management and conser­vation of fishery resources.
(12) A law that would empower the President to reorganize the Bureau of Customs and the Bureau of Internal Revenue in order to effectively rid those offices of venalities and increase their efficiency in their vital function of collecting taxes and revenues due the Government.
(13) A law creating an Export Authority which will be charged with development of export products and the ex­pansion of foreign trade.
(14) A law creating a Food and Drug Administration which shall guarantee the quality, purity, identity, safety and potency of foods and drugs to be provided to the people.
(15) A law creating a Philippine Maritime Commission which shall provide the organizational structure for the orderly operation and growth of Philippine shipping.
Eighth, that other economic legislation than the above-men­tioned which will assure the success of the Nation’s economic program be enacted as will in due course be submitted in an integrated form in a special legislative message to Congress.
The legislative message aforesaid will embody drafts of measures enumerated in the above recommendations but the same will be merely suggestive, leaving it to the Congress and the Members thereof to formulate the bills to be acted upon along the general tenor of the proposals embodied in the Presidential message on legislation.
CONCLUSION
We conclude in the conviction that during the past year, the base has been established for a big push forward in the Nation’s battle against the poverty of our people. The execution of this leap forward in the magnitude needed for success as gleaned from our recommendations is an imperative national necessity. Not to undertake this push or to attempt it half­heartedly and without the mighty exertion required would be a crime to the Nation which future generations will surely condemn. The mighty effort expected entails unprecedented sacrifice on the part of the people and on all of us. Nothing worthwhile can be achieved without tremendous effort and sacrifice. To break the manacles that hold our people chaired to misery in order that they may, at last, enjoy a prosperous life cannot be done without supreme energy and self-denial. This is the .opportunity in generations for our people to reach and to enjoy the fruits of a better life, or in the alternative, tragically to make it recede again away from their reach. We are so convinced in the very depths of our soul about this that we venture the appraisal that if we fail our people in this opportunity, it would have been preferable that we had not gone into their service at all.
On our part, we ask for the continued faith and confidence of the people in our labors and assure them that ail that we do is for their sake and for their well-being. It is not easy to lift our masses out of poverty but we will do what can humanly be done within the period of our mandate to succeed. Having attained the highest honor that a Filipino can dream of, especially for one of our very humble origin, we have no more interest in the discharge of our office except the interest of our country and the prosperity of all our countrymen. As a warranty of our complete devotion to our duty, my wife, children and myself have together vowed to God, to ourselves and to our people that while I shall strive to spread prosperity to our countrymen, on our part, during my incumbency, we shall not enrich ourselves even by one centavo beyond my statutory compensation.
With faith in God Almighty Who watches over mankind, we shall go on, with the collaboration of all well-intentioned countrymen, to pursue and seek, undaunted and unrelenting, that state of nationhood when the Filipino race shall enjoy as a normal state of affairs a blissful and dignified life of plenty for all.

Message
of
His Excellency Diosdado Macapagal
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Delivered on January 27, 1964]

Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Congress:
For the third time, I have the honor to appear before you and to present to you a report on the state of our nation. Two dramatic and eventful years have passed: this Administration now begins its third year in office. It is the projection of the past two years upon the future welfare and security of the nation which I would like to discuss with you on this occasion.
The welfare of our people has, without doubt, been substantially advanced. Not all improvements are immediately recognizable or easily detected, but there can be no question that our rate of growth as shown by all valid indicators points to continued expansion and development.
Unfortunately, political partisanship has caused some delay in the progress which this Administration endeavoured to achieve during the past two years. Partisan bickering among the political parties not only retarded progress and slowed the pace of development but also rendered impossible the full achievement of our objectives. However, we are a young nation and a bright future lies ahead of us. The past years of frustration must make way for future years of fulfilment. This must be done if we are to tip the scales against the disappointments of the past in favour of the hopes of the future.
While we have advanced in nearly all fields, our progress has not been as rapid or adequate as this Administration had desired. During the past two years, this Congress found itself unable to cooperate fully with the aims and purposes of the Administration owing mainly to the fact that the opposition held political control, first over both and then later over one of the Houses of Congress. It is my unhappy duty to report to our people that, as a result of bitter political conflict, the welfare of the people has often been overlooked, cast aside, or completely ignored. Members and leaders of all parties—all of us—have been guilty of playing too much politics, of leaving the work to those whose ability, no matter how outstanding, must prove unavailing unless they have the support of those in all the parties who have thus far placed politics above service to the people.
This is a different Congress. Both Houses of this Congress are now composed of a majority of Senators and Congressmen belonging to the party of the Administration. We now have a situation which better conforms to the accepted norm of representative government. It gives full scope to the system of political parties. While encouraging cooperation among the parties in the larger national interest it pinpoints party responsibility for the conduct of national affairs. Thus, the passage of new laws and the revision of old laws in the public interest can now be more easily undertaken. This must be done in order to enable this nation to achieve further progress toward the social and economic goals which we have envisioned for our people and for future generations to come.
Before this Congress stands you President himself tempered by the fire of honest self-appraisal. After two years of searching and endeavour, of sowing the seeds for better things, we may look forward to a bountiful harvest that will give greater hope to our people, as well as a destiny full of bright and exciting challenges.
Let us lay aside our political differences and work for the common goal: the good of our people. I hasten to assure you that the best interest of the people has been and will continue to be the prime consideration in all my acts and in all my deeds. We have passed through two years—a million moments filled with happiness as well as anxiety, with the thrill of success as well as the horror of failure. They have been moments of frustration and discouragement, of misunderstanding and regret, of hope and achievement. These are the million moments of the past two years which have been shared by us all: the rich and the poor, the powerful and the weak, the haves and the have-nots.
Our phrase, the “New Era,” has been both acclaimed and derided. Our honest desire is to create out of this land the kind of country our people deserve—a country able to satisfy the needs and serve the welfare of all its inhabitants, and to guarantee the protection and the security of this generation and of all generations to come. We have all been guilty of some neglect—some of us to a greater degree than others. I am aware that we have not as yet been able to satisfy in just measure the hopes and aspirations of our people which we envisioned two years ago. Since we share the same hopes of achievement for our glorious land and our heroic people, can we not now all join together to give them those things which they so justly deserve? Can we not now forsake our own narrow self-interest and devote our whole strength to the realization of greater progress and happiness throughout the land?
With the help of this Congress, we shall achieve our national goals far beyond our fondest dreams. With courage and honesty of conviction, with force and power of determination to move steadily forward, we can overcome the plagues and corrupting diseases which have weakened the national fiber and so restore the health of the body politic that we may accomplish without further delay the tasks that need urgently to be done.
All this requires courage, determination, understanding, trust and cooperation. We are one nation of Filipinos, brothers one unto the other, with God-given aims and purposes, and God-given means and abilities to achieve those aims and purposes.
We have all allowed ourselves to become confused and to lose sight of our true objectives. We have been blinded by power politics and its self-serving aims. We have been led into making utterances and performing deeds which have neither serve the present needs of our people nor nourished their hopes for a better life. How amazing and unbelievable it seems that some of those who are called upon to help the people have succumbed to the temptations of personal ambition and the lust for power! As I look back to these past few years utilized but only in part for the fulfilment of our pledges and the hopes of our people, and of which so great a portion has been wasted through misunderstanding, intolerance, selfishness, and luck of trust, I realize that our people can no longer be condemned indefinitely to endure the penalty of self-serving purposes and deeds. We must face the bitter truth that the politicians of our country—and I speak for all of us—have, in fact, given to our people neither all the goodness nor all the ability nor all the love which we pledged to them and which they, in turn, expected from us.
We must work together as one, with respect for one another, with single intent to achieve through cooperation that which is best for all and to help each other do that which is right for the good of all. Not one of us is perfect, but collectively we can pursue and attain our hopes and through mutual confidence show one to the other the error of our ways. The great sin is not in making a mistake but in refusing to recognize the mistake and to correct it.
This is the beginning of our third year in office. I have examined the road we have travelled, a road full of trials and tribulations. I have looked back over these past two years not as a politician with ready excuses nor as a candidate with new promises to make, but as a President with duties and responsibilities to you and to our people.
I have tried in this way to determine honestly in my own mind the success or failure of my efforts as President. In this mood of candid self-appraisal I must say that I am not quite satisfied with the results which have been achieved. I am not happy over the mistakes which could have been avoided. So much more could have been done. So much more must of necessity, be accomplished during the next two years before we can honestly say to ourselves and to our God: “We have done our true and sincere best for our people, within the measure of our abilities according to our lights.”
As we examine ourselves in relation to the state of the nation, what can we, in truth, say of ourselves? I cannot speak for you, but this I will say for myself: Never will I be able to give all that I desire, but with a courage born of the lessons learned in sorrow during the past two years, I must and I shall devote my waking hours, life itself, to the welfare of our people. No difficulty or obstacle, however stubborn or forbidding, shall alter my course or change my will.
We must provide a better life for our people. We must give less comfort to ourselves. We must provide more hope to our nation. We must seek less gratification ourselves.
Where do we go from here—from whence have we come? That which we can do is based solely on that which we have done: “For as ye sow, so shall ye reap.”
This Administration has tried to hasten the nation’s economic growth and improve public morality. We have resolved to attend as well to the problems of health, education, labor, social welfare, national security, cultural and scientific development, the administration of justice, the maintenance of peace and order, and foreign relations. These are the duties of this Administration. These duties are first and paramount.
This Administration has, during the past years, endeavoured to established a high standard of morality and conduct among government officials. This we felt in order to set a basic standard of conduct for the entire citizenry. We feel that we have been able to instill in the minds of the people the fact that as it prosecutes its drive for public morality, the Administration will never, under any circumstance, countenance graft and corruption. Corruption among government officials has to marked degree diminished, but it has not been completely eradicated though eradicated it must be.
We have achieved a decontrolled economy with a stable exchange rate. This no one can deny. We have improved our intentional reserves. We have had favourable balances of trade and favourable balances of payments during the past two years. Our per capita income is on the rise. Our industrial production continues to increase as does our agricultural output. The Land Reform Program is under way. A nationwide housing program for lower income groups has been launched. These are some of the good things which we in the Administration have done in our time.
Our industries have increased their use of local raw materials for the benefit of all, and as a result of our controversial but successful program of decontrol, substantial investments have been realized with the employment of both local and foreign capital so as to help establish the solid economic base for further growth.
Free enterprise has continued to prosper, and the era of stifling control seems now but a bad dream. New gigantic industries to promote the national welfare, such as steel, chemicals, pulp, and fertilizer, are underway. The prospects of employment improve in spite of our population explosion.
The establishment of these and similar enterprises will cause the proliferation of small and vital industries which will then provide the framework for self-sustained economic growth.
This Congress and the Administration have taken steps to abolish the share tenancy system and have given hope to the small farmer to produce for himself on an independent basis. The agricultural land reform code is an impressive and enduring monument to the farsightedness of our lawmakers. It may be difficult to enforce effectively, but enforce it we must if the future of our economic system is to be assured.
Our nation’s conduct in the field of international relations during the past two years has been characterized by a far more active participation in international affairs, particularly in the affairs of Southeast Asia. We have willingly accepted the challenge to carry the democratic message in our part of the world; we have played a prominent role in Maphilindo, the association of peoples of Malay origin; we have made progress on our claim to Sabah (North Borneo); we have assisted in mediating disputes between nations. Relationships of lasting importance have been formed between our country and the United States, as well as a number of Asian countries including Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Republic of China, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain, Mexico, and the new nations of Africa, particularly Madagascar.
Without diminishing our historic relations with the United States and other Western countries and without weakening our commitment to the cause of democracy and human rights, we have sought to expand our role in Asian affairs and thereby promote the stability and security of our region and enhance mutual understanding between the peoples of Asia and the people of the West.
On matters of foreign policy, the active counsel and cooperation of all parties in Congress will be sought at every opportunity.
All is not glory. Our people suffer from the continuing increase of prices and the short supply of rice. These price increases are the result no longer of decontrol, but of subsequent domestic and external pressures. The rice insufficiency in the country is aggravated by a world shortage of this commodity. To excuse ourselves or to blame others is of no moment now; what is imperative is a resolute approach to the solution of these problems.
For the future, all of us must work together to lay a new, solid foundation which will adequately utilize the natural resources which are our birthright. We must give confidence to our people. You and I must live up to and fulfil the degree of trust and confidence which our people have placed in us.
We must keep up the drive against graft.
We must implement more vigorously our program of economic and social progress and the ascendency of Filipinos in the national economy.
We must continue our active participation in foreign affairs, particularly those that affect our national interest.
We must increase our tax revenues and facilitate public borrowing to finance the various requirements rapid economic development.
We must establish an ef­fective administrative organization for economic de­velopment within the con­text of decentralized gov­ernment.
We must make credit available to investors within the framework of a sta­ble currency.
We must find a satisfac­tory solution to the prob­lem of rising prices.
We must insure an ade­quate rice supply to the people as we seek self-suf­ficiency through increased production.
We must provide ready employment opportunities while stable jobs are being created under the econo­mic program.
We must attract and give assurances to private investments, both domes­tic and foreign.
We must increase the minimum wage while as­suring a reasonable margin of profit for employers.
We must implement a nationwide housing pro­gram for our slum and hut dwellers.
We must intensify the development of tourism as a source of dollar revenue.
We must act together to fight and destroy smug­gling.
We must improve fur­ther the administration of justice.
We must improve and strengthen the local police forces all over the coun­try.
We must adopt electoral reforms to frustrate frauds and exorbitant spending by candidates.
The hope of our nation lies in our hands. The state of the nation lies in our hearts. I pledge to you for the sake of our country, my fullest cooperation and resolve to rid our nation of the many evils which have in the past plagued our land and sapped our strength and vitality.
The state of our nation ultimately depends upon our true and honest ap­praisal of ourselves, our understanding, our confi­dence, and our ability to sacrifice for the good of the mass of our people ra­ther than for the welfare of any particular group. We must cast off the false masks of the image-makers; the time has come to be ourselves so that what we are will shine through our works. Determined to correct the mistakes of the past and to undertake new and more hopeful initia­tives for the future. I ap­peal to you for mutual understanding so that with a mighty will we shall labor and sacrifice together to give our people the good life they desire and deserve, but which has been denied them for so long. Let us cast aside petty personal jealousies and partisan politics from our lives; let us work only for the common good. Bound together in this Alliance for the Common Good, there are no limits to what we can do. With these words of good will towards men of good will and in this solemn act of good will, I honor you and I thank you.

Message
of
His Excellency Diosdado Macapagal
President of the Philippines
To the Congress
On the State of the Nation
[Delivered on January 25, 1965]
“The Philippines After Three Years (1962-1965)”
Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker,
Ladies and Gentlemen of Congress:
Three years ago, on this very platform, we presented the Socio-Economic Program of the Nation designed to secure the objective of economic stability and growth of the country and the alleviations of the condition of the common man.
We were filled with conviction and enthusiasm; we were inspired with the bright hope that with the attainment of those objectives, national prosperity would be achieved and the level of livelihood of the masses of our people elevated.
The same optimism and conviction still inspire us as we look back in retrospect at the last three years. Despite the difficulties and odds that confronted us in the task of moving toward our desired goals, we submit that we have been able to accomplish tangible results in carrying out the fight against poverty by effectively laying the basis of future growth and progress in freedom.
FILIPINO WAY OF LIFE
We must begin with the fundamental act of casting a scrutinizing glance at the state of our way of life. It has become a truism that the Filipino way of life consists of three minimum elements, namely, the system of freedom, the love for peace and the sustenance of the rule of law. As long as these essential ingredients of Filipinism are safeguarded, the country, whatever its problems, is safe and the future of our posterity is secure.
As we perform our duty of rendering an account of our trust to our people, we are gratified that we have strengthened these fundamental tenets of our national life and destiny.
The system of freedom—we have restored free enterprise. We have upheld the freedom of the press and other media to the tolerance of license. We believe so firmly in freedom that given a choice between licentious freedom and restricted freedom, we have by deeds preferred license to restriction because of our conviction that in an aspiring democracy in Afro-Asia, licentious freedom is better than restricted freedom because freedom has the inherent virtue of restraining its excesses but restriction bears the danger of curtailment which may lead to tyranny and despotism.
Love for peace—this is exemplified in the doctrine sanctified in our Constitution which renounces war as an instrument of national policy. We have served the cause of peace in our land by capturing Jesus Lava, the top head and brain of the communists who seek to overthrow our peace and freedom.
Not only have we maintained peace and tranquility among ourselves but we have also been fortunate to be saved from the international turmoil that has beset our immediate neighbors like Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea, Free China and India. We attribute this to our policy of firm opposition to international communism, aggression, subversion and infiltration in our country and to our security alliance with the United States and other free nations.
The rule of law—we all feel gratified that our people will not accept any system other than the rule of law which assures justice to the humblest citizen vis a viz the most powerful in the land. All have contributed to the impregnability of the rule of law in our society but we believe that the outstanding credit for this stability in our democratic institutions belongs to the Supreme Court under the leadership of Chief of Justice Cesar Bengzon all of whose members have upheld with zeal the inviolability of the rule of law in our free society.
Satisfied that we have bolstered the preservation of our free society, which is of overriding importance, we shall now review the results of our efforts in the last three years in the light of the goals that we have set and the conditions under which we were constrained to attain those goals for our people, deduce there from what remains to be done and draw a picture of the outlook for the future.
Free Enterprise and Nationalism
The things done which we shall speak of are the cumulative significance of the past three years. They were not the logical results of an economy allowed to maintain its sedentary pace in the mainstream of the status quo. Radical changes had to be introduced into the economic structure of the country. Drastic reforms in administration had to be undertaken, and tremendous efforts had to be exerted to provide the social services demanded by an expanding population in the face of inadequate resources.
The national objectives we defined had to confront, in their implementation, the reality of a situation the terms of which were not merely issues of the national condition but of the surrounding actuality of ourselves as a sovereign nation. We formulated those objectives at a time when the Philippine Republic had to exercise larger responsibilities within the Southeast Asian area as well as in the emergent community of the Afro-Asian continent.
It was for this reason that the most basic and fundamental change which was instituted by the Administration was to release the innate power of our people for progress by liberating the economy from controls and thus enabling our citizens to assume the major responsibility for national development.
The controlling idea of the Nation’s program of free enterprise that we launched was nationalism, and the goal of that nationalism was economic prosperity and enlarged freedom for the masses of the Filipino people.
ESTABLISHING THE BASE FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROWTH
We shall now list the main results of our efforts on the progress of this program fro the people which we shall number one (1) to (109). The problem of restoring economic stability must inevitably lead to the necessity of creating an assured base for dynamic national growth.
Production
1)             In this connection, agricultural production rose by 4.8 per cent during crop year 1964, slightly lower than the 5.0 per cent increase registered the previous year. On the other hand, mining output increased 6.3 per cent over calendar year 1964, much better than the 1.5 per cent registered in 1963. Most encouraging of all, manufacturing production rose by 10.7 per cent for the first nine months of 1964, in contrast to the 6.4 per cent recorded the previous year. Production trends are, therefore, very satisfactory.
Credit
2)             On the other hand, the spurt in physical production was accompanied by a substantial increase in domestic credits which as of October 1964 had risen by 13.5 per cent over the previous twelve months, a development which requires close watch.
International Reserve
3)             In the external sector, foreign exchange receipts totaled $1,358 million or an increase of 17.4 per cent over the previous year. Foreign exchange disbursements amounted to $1,372 million, 19.4 per cent over 1963. Over the year, therefore, net foreign exchange disbursements amounted to $15 million. Correspondingly, the international reserves stood at $136 million by the end of 1964 compared to $147 million a year ago.
Infrastructure Program
The success in attracting an increasing magnitude of private investments in the Nation’s development efforts is to a certain extent dependent on the ability of the Government to lay the infrastructure conducive to enhancing investment possibilities in industry and agriculture.
Highways
The first area of priority was the improvement and expansion of our highway and land transport networks.
From 1962 to 1964, the Bureau of Public Highways undertook the construction and improvement of 7,633 kilometers of national, provincial, city and municipal roads at a total cost of P107.9 million in addition to 3,500 linear meters of bridges constructed and improved involving an expenditure of P22.6 million.
In 1964 alone, P13 million was spent for the construction of 913 kilometers of feeder and secondary roads and the paving or improvement of another 975 kilometers; while P420,000 was expended for construction and improvement of 435 lineal meters of small bridges. During last year, a total of 27,550 kilometers of combined national, provincial and city roads and 31,000 lineal meters of bridges were maintained and repaired with total expenditures of P52,625,170 under the Highway Special Fund.
4)             Among the major projects undertaken during the past three years in highway construction were the concrete paving of portions of the Manila South Road in Quezon, Laguna and Camarines Norte; the Manila North Road in Tarlac and Pangasinan; the Cabuyao-Calamba Road in Laguna; the Marawi City-Iligan City Road; the Balintawak-Novaliches Road in Quezon City; the Bagabag-Banawe Road in Nueva Vizcaya.
5)             Major asphalt road projects included the Baguio-Bontoc and the Benguet-Kalinga Road in Mountain Province; the Cagayan Valley Road in Cagayan; the Misamis Oriental-Agusan Road; the Surigao-Agusan Road and Iba North Road in Zambales.
6)             Some of the major bridge projects were the construction of the Catarman Bridge in Samar and the Tomacalao Bridge in Ilocos Norte, and the improvement of Del Pan Bridge in Manila.
7)             As of the present, a number of highway and bridge projects are underway. These include the widening of the Manila North Road from Tullahan Bridge to the Malinta Section in Bulacan; the improvement of the Dalton-Sta. Fe Section of the Cagayan Valley Road; the Cotabato-Davao Road and million-peso bridge projects in Nagtahan, Manila; Buntun, Cagayan; Sipocot, Camarines Sur; Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro: and Padilla, Pangasinan. The construction of an underpass in P. Burgos Street and the improvement of the Guadalupe Bridge in Makati, Rizal, will soon be started.
8)             On the Nation’s project of a Pan-Philippine Highway System, the existing kilometrage consists of 26,223 kilometers in Luzon, 16,446 kilometers in the Visayas and 13,462 in Mindanao or a total of 56,131 kilometers of which 16% was paved, 62% paved with gravel or stone and 22% is unsurfaced. In this System, there are 11,333 bridges with a total length of 240,525 lineal meters of which 155,790 lineal meters or 65% are of contemporary construction. The completion of this project requires the concreting of 3,003 kilometers during the period 1965-1969.
Flood Control and Irrigation
The second urgent objective was the expansion of flood control and drainage and irrigation facilities.
9)             About 232 flood control and drainage projects have been completed with 92 more in various stages of completion. These projects which are estimated to protect 155,000 hectares of valuable land involved an expenditure of P29.6 million in the past three years. Notable projects undertaken were the Solis-Tecson, Paranaque, Blumentritt and Reyes Severino drainage mains in Manila and suburbs.
10)          Five (5) national irrigation projects, serving a combined area of some 30,800 hectares, were completed during the same period. Construction of 13 other national irrigation projects, servicing an additional 60,000 hectares, are underway. In communal irrigation, 211 projects have been completed as of the end of 1964, with 25 others soon to be completed. These communal projects would add 60,700 hectares to our irrigated agricultural lands.
Electrification
Necessary to the program of socio-economic development is the task of power conservation and the scientific utilization of power for general well-being and public convenience.
11)          The thermal plan in Limay, Bataan, will have a 75,000 kilowatt initial capacity. Aside from increasing the power for the Luzon Grid especially during the dry season, this project will also serve the energy requirements of the Bataan Peninsula.
12)          Even as these projects are being implemented, the NPC is pursuing other functions in its continuing efforts to develop additional power projects. These consist of surveys, investigations, project planning, geologic studies and design. In 1964 alone, the NPC surveyed six areas, investigated 31 rivers, planned four large-scale projects for development and assessed an additional power potential of 80,000 kilowatts coming mostly from small streams. This has brought the total assessed water potential to 2,680,000 kilowatts, including 1,416,000 KW in Luzon, 104,000 KW in the Visayas and 1,160,000 KW in Mindanao.
Complementing the activities of the National Power Corporation in bringing the benefits of electricity to our rural populace is the Electrification Administration.
The 1960 census indicates that only 766,000 out of 4,648,000 total dwellings, or about 16%, were served by electricity; the remaining 84% of the populace, composed largely of rural dwellers, are without the benefits of electric service.
The capacity of the Electrification Administration to assist and encourage the establishment of a sufficient number of electrification systems has been seriously handicapped by the inadequacy of available funds.
13)          Since its creation, the Electrification Administration has initiated some 40 electrification projects ranging from 30-kilowatt to 300-kilowatt generating systems, financed mostly from its allotment for capital expenditures during Fiscal Years 1964 and 1965. This performance, although it underscores a conscious direction of efforts in pursuance of desirable goals, is still insufficient to meet our total requirements.
Obviously, nothing short of a nationwide crash program could forge a major breakthrough in this particular field.
14)          Therefore, we have initially provided for the acquisition of $5 million worth of equipment and materials from Japanese reparations. This initial equipment outlay, refunds, will be adequate to install electric systems in about 240 towns. Additional equipment would be installed in subsequent stages of the program.
The improvement and modernization plan for the Manila International Airport is being implemented with a loan of $5.6 million from the Export-Import Bank of Washington.
15)          In this connection, it is most gratifying to note that in our state visit to the United States last October, President Johnson manifested his interest in a nationwide rural electrification program as a possible area of American financial assistance.
But we are not yet satisfied with the above infrastructure development during the past three years. We are aware that there are still many projects which have been carefully planned but as yet not implemented due to lack of funds.
16)          In fact, we have programmed for FY 1965 the prosecution of several essential projects. There are projects involving a school building program, irrigation, rural electrification, road construction, airport and air navigation, and waterworks and artesian wells, the total cost of which would amount to about P486 million. But we regret to say that without any substantial increase in government income, we may not be able to start on many of these projects due to the non-availability of funds.
Finally, we are pleased to announce the successful public issue of $15 million worth of Philippine government bonds in the United States a few days ago; the issue was oversubscribed. Proceeds of this bond issue will be channeled to the NWSA expansion program and other priority development projects.
The success and the relative ease which characterized our foreign borrowing negotiations are strongly indicative of the soundness of our international credit position, the respect of other nations in our financial capabilities, and the confidence of these nations in our ability to adhere to our international commitments.
Incentives and Assistance to Industries 
In the promotion of industrial growth, the government has provided a healthy investment climate through protection, incentives, and varied forms of financial assistance.
17)          Thus, in the case of the Iligan Integrated Steel Mills project, a half-billion peso undertaking designed to meet the country’s iron and steel requirements for industrial expansion and development, $62.3 million was obtained from the Export-Import Bank of Washington early last year.
18)          In the case of the coastwise shipping program, 40 million deutch marks were made available by the Kreditanstalt of Germany for loans to the private sector through the Development Bank of the Philippines.
The most significant of the tax exemption laws, however, is the Basic Industries Law. At present, about 50 basic industries have availed of the exemption privilege. The magnitude in absolute figures of the assistance given to these industries in terms of tax savings amounted to P46 million from March, 1963 to June, 1964. Under our Administration, the Nation’s small cottage industries have thrived and grown.
19)          The expansion program of the National Waterworks and Sewerage Authority was assured of $20.2 million from the World Bank.
20)          The U. P. College of Agriculture in Los Baños, Laguna obtained a $6 million loan commitment from the World Bank for the construction and improvement of its facilities.
21)          A $6 million credit line for the Ports and Harbors Program of expansion and modernization was re-negotiated.
22)          As of the end of 1962 when the new and necessary industries law terminated, 589 new and necessary industries were in actual operation, substantially developed and capable of operating without the need for additional assistance form the government.
NACIDA
23)          It should be mentioned here that the NACIDA, whose prime responsibility and function is the development of cottage industries, was established at the start of this Administration. After the first nine months of operation, the NACIDA registered a total of 1,770 cottage industries. For the past three years, NACIDA has conducted 410 researchers in foods, ceramics, fiber craft, wood, bamboo and rattan craft which have encouraged cottage industry activities along these lines.
Loans and Investment Council
24)          To coordinate the resources of the Government financial institutions for optimal effect, we established the Loans and Investment Council early in 1963. We are happy to report that the investment placements as of the end of 1964 of the member financial institutions have reached P3,538 million, an increase of 15.4 per cent over the previous year, and some 70 per cent more than the level of P2,077 million in 1961. Most of these funds have been used to finance vital agricultural, industrial, and commercial development requirements. The existence of the Council has also made possible syndicated financing by the member institutions for very large projects, where it might not have been possible for one institution along to bear the risk.
Such coordination never before undertaken has made possible the approval of the $62.3 million loan by the United States Export-Import Bank to the Iligan Steel Mills, and has facilitated the negotiations now going on between the Sta. Ines Steel Corporation and the Kreditanstalt of Germany. These two major projects when completed will supply the economy with 520,000 tons of steel products annually and will reduce steel importations by 80 per cent. The pace of industrialization will be substantially accelerated with these projects. Corollary steps are now being undertaken on the development of metallurgical coal, refractory bricks, the necessary technical services, as well as geological investigations and serial surveys.
Government Finances
In a country of scarce resources such as ours, it is imperative that public finances should be scrupulously administered so as to avoid situations where serious inbalances occur as a result of great disparity between income and expenditure.
Actual Income
25)          Since 1962, government receipts from all sources have risen appreciably on an average of about 17 per cent. From P1.2 billion in FY 1961, government collections increased to P1.6 billion in FY 1963 and to about P1.9 billion in FY 1964.
This gratifying performance was due mainly to the satisfactory efforts of the Government’s collection agencies.
26)          Gross collections made by the Bureau of Customs steadily increased from P564 million in 1962 to P631 million in 1963 and finally to P666 million in 1964. These figures show an increase of 11.9 per cent in 1963 and another 5.5 per cent in 1963 to 1964.
27)          Moreover, the Bureau of Customs intensified its efforts against smuggling as borne out by relevant statistics. During FY 1964, additional taxes and duties collected at the port of Manila from technical and pure smuggling amounted to P8.5 million which was P3.5 million more than that collected in FY 1963. Additional collections effected by reason of re-appraisal and/or reclassification of imported goods after examination for the last three years amounted to P56 million.
The performance of the other major collecting arm of the government—the Bureau of Internal Revenue—was also noteworthy.
28)          During the period from 1962 to 1964 gross internal revenue collection reached P3.6 billion as compared to only P2.3 billion collected for the period from 1959 to 1961. These figures represent a notable increase of P1.3 billion in collections. Significantly, collections from all major internal revenue sources registered increases thereby attesting to the efficiency of the administrative reforms implemented by that office.
In a developing country like the Philippines, the Government has the major responsibility of providing increasing service and social overhead projects designed to spur economic development.
Needed Income
For 1964 alone, a total P2.1 billion was spent for the purpose of operating the Government, providing facilities for peace and order and stimulating economic and social development. We must add that the expenditures of the National Government have been increasing over the years, and they will continue to increase as the population increases and the economy develops. In contrast, our income, even as it increases during the years, has not been of such magnitude as to cope with actual and programmed expenditure. Unless revenues are adequately augmented, it is estimated that from FY 1966 to FY 1970, a recurring revenue deficit averaging P425 million annually is likely to occur.
This projected deficit is based on the revised Five-Year Fiscal Program covering FY 1966-1970 of the operating departments and agencies and projections of revenues from existing sources. The gap would even be larger considering the new exemptions and use of funds for other purposes as contained in legislation passed during the last session.
Furthermore, if all the existing appropriations under the General Fund for this current fiscal year were taken into consideration, and considering that intensified tax collection has already raised collection by 17 per cent, the disparity between expected revenues of some P1.9 billion and statutorily authorized expenditures of over P4.0 billion in the General Fund alone would be impossible to bridge, and would be meaningless for operational purposes.
In the light of this situation, we would stress again our resolve to pursue sound and prudent fiscal policies.
29)          Thus, although the Government borrowed a gross amount of P377 million from January 1962 to June 1963, it redeemed P287 million.
In turn, it devolves upon Congress to tap new sources of revenue. When appropriation measures are passed by Congress, the Executive considers them not decisively from the availability of revenues but from the essentiality and importance of the service provided. It is the duty of the Government to provide and to find ways and means of financing such services which promote the public welfare.
Local Government Finances
30)          Moreover, the fiscal position of the local governments showed marked improvements. Real property tax collections for FY 1964 were P26 million more than the collections made during FY 1961. The total gross income from general fund sources of local governments in FY 1963 was P54 million more than the income for FY 1961. In addition, local governments received, as their share from internal revenue collections of the national Government, P318 million during FY 1963, representing an increase of P100 million over what they received in FY 1961.
The role of government corporations in the realm of economic development lies essentially in undertaking ventures in new and untried fields where the risks involved may inhibit private enterprise.
In this sense, therefore, government corporations play a pivotal role in the attainment of our development objectives, particularly in the areas of production and industrial development and social amelioration.
31)          The Cebu Portland Cement Company sold its Naga Cement Plant to a private corporation in August 1963 and since then has concentrated its activities to the promotion of the coal industry and coke processing. It has laid the groundwork for the establishment of a coking plant in Malangas, Zamboanga del Sur.
32)          As a significant social experiment aimed at improving the condition of labor, the Government effected the transfer of the NDC textile mills to its employees. The GSIS has sold 5 per cent of its shares in the Philippine Air Lines. Moreover, the GSIS has decided to sell its preemptive shares in PAL to the private sector as it is still considering the eventual liquidation of its shares in this airline company.
33)          While the transfer of the Iligan Integrated Steel Mills to a private group is being finalized, the National Shipyards and Steel Corporation have expanded dry-docking and shipbuilding facilities at the Bataan National Shipyards. NASSCO is now capable of undertaking repairs on Philippine Navy Ships, privately-owned inter-island and ocean-going vessels which before had to be serviced in Japan, Hongkong and the United States.
34)          A major undertaking of NASSCO now nearing completion is the Jose Panganiban project in Camarines Norte which is designed as the first modern pig iron smelting plant in the country for the processing of indigenous iron ore to pig iron.
The expansion projects of the Philippines National Railways (formerly the Manila Railroad Company) would extend its lines by 310 kilometers from Nueva Ecija to Cagayan in the North and the existing lines in Southern Luzon by 153 kilometers. Progress of these projects has been slow in view of financial stringencies being faced by the PNR.
35)          Procurement of materials and supplies for the Sorsogon project will be accelerated this year with the signing of a loan agreement with Japanese suppliers.
DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES
At the root of the difficulties being faced by any developing economy is the problem of self-sufficiency in food, the ultimate necessity for life. The magnitude of this problem may be properly gauged when one considers that with our population increasing by 3.2 per cent annually, we have to feed 20,000 more mouths every week, or one million every year.
Increased Productivity in Agriculture
These considerations have spurred the Government to intensify its efforts in achieving greater productivity in food, particularly rice, corn, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products. Of these, rice and corn, being the country’s primary staples, received the greatest concentration of the Government’s efforts.
Rice and Corn Production
36)          The rice and corn production program of the Rice and Corn Coordinating Council, involving various forms of assistance to farmers, yielded encouraging results. During the crop year 1963-64, assistance under this program was extended to 311,889 rice farmers with an area of 493,853 hectares and to 21,851 corn farmers with an area of 49,340 hectares. As a result, rice production in assisted areas increased from 14.8 million cavans to 24 million cavans, with the yield per hectare registering a remarkable increase of from 30 cavans to 48.55 cavans or by 61 per cent.
37)          Likewise, the yield of corn increased from 789,000 cavans to 1,480,000 cavans. This represents an increase of almost 100 per cent in yield per hectare.
38)          Apart from this continuing program to improve rice and corn culture, the Government also launched a crash program of rice production during the “palagad” season of from January to June, 1964, in order to offset, to the extent possible, the rice shortage of last year. This was participated in by fourteen cooperating agencies headed by the administratively created Rice and Corn Authority, with each agency taking charge of a specific function, from farm planning, fertilizer and cereal distribution, soil analysis, research, irrigation to administrative and statistical coordination.
The crash program covered 170,082 hectares in 42 provinces with 77,205 farmers involved. Although only about 20 per cent of the area was fertilized and 33 per cent chemically treated, the yield per hectare amounted to 48.4 cavans, as compared to the national average of only 28 cavans per hectare in previous years.
From the above results we can draw the assurance that, given the necessary implements and the means for carrying out far-ranging programs of this kind, the Philippines can eventually achieve self-sufficiency in rice. We are still stumped by the same problems—fiscal, organizational, logistical and other problems. More than anything else, the habitual typhoons and floods in the country have done much to negate our efforts.
The Government’s determination to pursue a consistent program of increased food production has been undaunted by these setbacks caused by nature, but the intensification of our efforts to expand the program to all areas is constrained by the Achilles heel of our developmental endeavor—lack of revenues. More funds than are currently available would be required to achieve the ultimate goal of self-sufficiency and thus enable us to depend on our own resources.
Our per capita consumption of meat, poultry, eggs and dairy products stands among the lowest in the world. In recognition of this deficiency, the Government has embarked on a long range program of propagating and improving our livestock and poultry population under the auspices of the Bureau of Animal Industry.
39)          Thus, the number of artificial breeding centers was increased from only two in 1961 to 22 in 1964; natural breeding services, from 3,639 to 6,624; and artificial breeding services, from 6,002 to 8,882. Likewise, the number of existing propagation stations was doubled in three years from 36 in 1961 to 72 in 1964.
40)          The Government has also imported pure breeds, notably cattle, swine and chicken, which were either dispersed, loaned out or sold for breeding purposes.
41)          In disease control, about 3 million livestock and 84 million poultry were vaccinated in the three years from 1962 to 1964, and some 23 researches completed for the improvement of animal breeds and the cure of diseases.
42)          Manufacture of biologics and sera has been maintained at an average of some 103 million doses annually.
We note with satisfaction that these activities by the Government are being augmented to some extent by private projects which are our prime hope for economic growth. There are now 24 feed manufacturers, three more than in 1961. Distributions of feed products are being facilitated with the increase in the number of retailers from 535 in 1961 to 782 as of last count. We have also seen the number of cattle ranchers increase in the last three years, from 312 to1,353, and the number of meat packing plants from 45 t o126.
43)          Farm-size animal and poultry raising projects likewise increased from 9,061 in 1961 to 18,902 in 1964.
44)          These activities have contributed in no small measure to the increase in poultry and livestock population for the period from 1961 to 1964 in these magnitudes; 22 per cent for carabaos, 26 per cent for cattle, 31 per cent for hogs, 24 per cent for chicken and 20 per cent for ducks. Not only have these increases cut down our import requirements of meat and poultry, but more important, they reflect a discernible breakthrough in our aspirations to bring our consumption of superior nutrients closer to Philippine nutritional standards.
Fishing
The creation of the Philippine Fisheries Commission during our Administration under Republic Act No. 3512 afforded the Government a more effective vehicle for launching an accelerated fisheries development program aimed at increasing fish production from both inland and marine waters.
45)          Corollary to the establishment of this Commission, an area comprising about one hectare of Manila Bay in Navotas, Rizal, was reserved as a fisheries development center by virtue of Proclamation No. 87, and earlier, Pier No. 14 was declared for the exclusive use of fishing vessels.
With these measures, the intensification of various fishery projects ensued in the following years. Fisherman’s wharves have been started in Barugao, Leyte; Gumaca, Quezon; Damortis, La Union; Baguey, Cagayan; Bayawan, Negros Oriental; and Guiuan, Samar.
46)          Under the joint auspices of the Emergency Employment Administration and the Fisheries Commission, 10-ton refrigerated ice plants for storage were constructed in Mercedes, Camarines Norte; Sagon, Negros Occidental; Barugao, Leyte; and Bayawan, Negros Oriental. Smaller plants with 6-ton capacity were put up in Guiuan, Samar; Magallanes, Sorsogon and New Washington, Aklan. Assistance was also received from the U. S. AID-ACA in the form of refrigerated equipment valued at $200,000.00.
47)          There are now almost 133,000 hectares of fishponds in operation involving a total investment of P265 million. Since 1962, a total of 941 fishpond applications has been received and processed, with an aggregate area of 34,670 hectares. Demonstration and experimental fishponds for bangos culture and other fresh water fish culture have been established in 36 areas.
48)          In addition to these measures, steps were also taken to increase output in existing resources. The use of purse seine for deep-sea fishing has been emphasized; from only 6 in 1961, there are now 23 purse seine in use, with sixty more expected to begin operation at the start of 1965.
We see in these the chance of achieving sufficient supply for our domestic requirements and the beginning of a thriving export industry for fish and fishery products.
Forest Conservation and Utilization
Our forest resources continue to play a dominant role in the economy, being one of its traditional major dollar earners and a natural protection from the destructive effect of floods.
Hence, the Bureau of Forestry has instituted a system of sustained yield management through the selective logging method which has evoked favorable reaction from various sectors as an effective measure of conserving our forest resources.
49)          The activities of the Reforestation Administration during the past three years have been geared to this same end. Between 1962 and 1964, some 88,852 hectares were reforested and 319,674 hectares placed under maintenance. During the same period some 2,703,000 liters of seed stock were sown in the plantations where now stand some 193 million living trees. Were it not for the damage wrought by strong typhoons in 1964, the results would have been much more.
Mineral Resources
The development, exploitation and wise utilization of the mineral resources of the country are a continuing responsibility of the government.
50)          From 1962 to 1964, geological and mineral surveys conducted by the Bureau of Mines covered nearly 3 million hectares. From these surveys were discovered the aluminous laterite deposit in Bucas Grande, Surigao, the magnetite (iron) beach sand deposits along the Luzon coastline, and the asbestos deposits in the Zambales-Pangasinan region. Detailed geological studies were also conducted on the chromite deposit in the Zambales region; iron deposits in Ilocos Norte, Camarines Norte, Rizal, Oriental Mindoro, Zamboanga City and Zamboanga del Sur; copper deposits in Negros Occidental. Exploration work disclosed substantial additional reserves of coals, asbestos, nickelliferous laterite, nickel ore and alumina laterite.
51)          Of far-reaching significance in the development of our vast mineral resources is the scheduled bidding for the operation of Parcel II of the Surigao Mineral Reservation, which contains an area of 40,000 hectares rich in supply of nickel deposits.
SOCIAL SERVICES AND WELFARE PROGRAM
Land Reform
In recalling the crusade of the Administration to promote the welfare of the common man, we must necessarily make reference to the enactment of the Land Reform Code for we consider this event as the milestone of our endeavors. The welfare of the common man has been and continues to be our central concern.
Despite the elimination of the Land Tax provision in the code, which could have provided adequate revenues with which to speedily implement Land Reform, we are happy to announce that the Government has been able with the meager finances available to gradually carry out its objectives.
52)          Through the National Land Reform Council, which coordinates the plans and activities of the different land reform agencies, we have been able to establish dynamic machinery which is capable, with adequate financial support, to transform the objectives of land reform into reality.
Visible implementation, however, has been limited due mainly to the inability of present government finances to provide the fund requirements of the Land Bank amounting to P150 million. Tangible benefits were largely the product of the Land Authority’s laborious efforts.
53)          The Land Authority has undertaken a program to increase the productivity, to raise the standard of living conditions of the beneficiaries and to improve the administrative management of settlement projects and landed estates which were taken over from the defunct NARRA and LTA. This program involves settlements and estates, having an aggregate area of 452,296 hectares which accommodate 48,520 families.
54)          In consonance with the objective of acquiring land for distribution, three agricultural landed estates with an aggregate area of 2,214 hectares have been expropriated, while the expropriation of 7 additional estates with a total are of 6,487 hectares is still pending.
55)          To give substance to our program of land for the landless, distribution of land was undertaken involving LTA estates. As a result, 250 agreements to sell and 29 transfers of rights were issued, while 485 deeds of sale and 29 transfers of rights were issued, while 485 deeds of sale were released. Furthermore, 340 sales applications were processed and investigated and 80 orders of award were given to applicants.
56)          The Land Authority has paved the way for the proclamation of leasehold areas in Plaridel, Bulacan; San Luis, Pampanga and at Concepcion, Tarlac. These land reform districts involve some 7,500 farmers cultivating an aggregate area of about 17,700 hectares of land.
These are concrete and tangible works which are eloquent proof of the government’s firm resolve to make the Land Reform Code a dynamic instrument for fighting poverty through increased production. They should allay all doubts on the feasibility and certain realization of our ambitious and goals.
But these activities, heartwarming as they may seem, cannot be used to validly excuse the neglect and failure in providing the Government with additional funds which could have been channeled, among other vital needs, to accelerate land reform activities. To render the program fully operational, a total appropriation of P597 million would be required.
Health
The problem of maintaining the nation’s health requires nothing less than unceasing vigilance.
There have been marked improvements in sanitation, community water systems, drainage systems, refuse collection and waste disposal.
In our effort to improve the nutritional deficiencies among Filipinos, we are continuing to implement the Rice Enrichment Program with inspectors being sent to the provinces to assure its success.
57)          Over the last three years, 74 hospitals have been constructed or improved at a cost of about P19 million. In addition, the facilities of existing government hospitals have been expanded and bed capacity increase.
58)          To further improve medical care to a greater number of patients, the Bureau of Medical Services has urged the growth and development of privately owned hospitals, which now number 238 and accommodate a total bed capacity of 10,811.
59)          Three Medical Centers (Baguio General Hospital, Southern Islands Hospital and Davao General Hospital), and 20 hospitals were developed as teaching hospitals.
The campaign for disease control has continued without pause.
60)          In Malaria control, we have developed a program which has been carried out with relative success. The morbidity and mortality rate from malaria dropped from 135.8 and 4.3 respectively in 1962 to 86.2 and 3.3 respectively in 1963 per 100,000 population.
61)          In tuberculosis control, over 3,000,000 patients were attended to by mobile units which covered a population of 9,000,000 people. Since 1962, 2,500,000 children were tuberculine tested of whom 1,500,000 were vaccinated with BCG. In large measure, this activity was the cause for the drop of tuberculosis mortality from 79.5 in 1962 to 72 per 100,000 population in 1963.
Education
We must face realistically the classroom needs for public elementary schools. There are now 15,032 temporary classrooms and 3,269 classrooms in rented buildings. Due to deterioration, 6,415 classrooms need to be replaced every year. Considering the annual increase of enrolment of 300,000 there is additional need for 5,454 classrooms or a total of 11,865 classrooms which are immediately needed. This need requires an expenditure of P52.5 million.
62)          In spite of revenue limitations, we affected an increase of P95 million in the 1964-65 outlays for education over that of 1963-64. The magnitude of this increase is accentuated by the fact that outlays for 1963-64. The magnitude of this increase is accentuated by the fact that an outlay for 1963-64 was itself P40 million over that of 1962-63. Within two years, therefore, outlays for education rose by 37 per cent.
Only by increasing the budget for education were we able to solve the recurring school crisis brought about by rapid population growth.
63)          The additional amount expended made possible the appointment of 39,575 new public elementary school teachers over the last three years and the opening or construction of 4,673 classroom units with the capacity of absorbing at least 187,000 additional students on just a single shift.
64)          It also provided every public school elementary and secondary pupil with at least three books, or a total of 16 million textbooks valued at P36 million.
65)          In the area of higher education, the progress achieved by the University of the Philippines is worthy of special mention. It has won the recognition and support of American foundations in an unprecedented manner and it has attracted Asian students in increasing number.
66)          Three additional state colleges were established during the period in review namely, the Mindanao Institute of Technology at Kabacan, Cotabato; the Central Luzon Polytechnique College of Cabanatuan City and the Don Severino Agricultural College at Indang, Cavite.
67)          Two universities, the Central Luzon State University in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija and the University of Eastern Philippines at Catarman, Samar have been elevated from College status.
68)          In the development of skilled manpower in agriculture, industrial, trade-technical, fishery and other vocational areas, it is heartening to report that whereas in 1961-62, the Bureau of Vocational Educational had 174 schools with an enrollment of 68,769; the school year 1964-65 finds it with 30 more schools and 17,988 more students.
69)          A significant contribution of the public schools to national production consists of their agricultural projects which involved the cultivation of 124,866 hectares producing varied crops with a total value of about P62 million. There are now 27,158 food production projects among public school students and personnel.
70)          To better equip our adult illiterates for greater opportunities, our education authorities have been implementing a program of adult education. About 18,242 adult illiterates have taken advantage of this program.
71)          To complement all these activities, there have been great strides taken to improve the private school system, the library network and the National Museum which is the repository of the national record and is charged with the heavy and crucial responsibility of “perpetuating all that is desirable in the national heritage.”
72)          Our education officials have expended a major share of their energies towards the upgrading of the quality of graduates through the revision of curricula and the selection of qualified personnel.
Housing
Many of us are aware of the fact that housing projects, both governmental and private, have literally mushroomed in the last three years.
73)          The enactment of R. A. No. 3469 was propitious for it made possible the construction of badly needed Multi-Storey Tenement Buildings with an initial appropriation of P15 million. The direct result is that the government is now in the final stage of completing the construction of for multi-storey projects which are located at Vitas, Tondo, Manila; at Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila; at the NDC Compound, Sta. Mesa, Manila; and at Fort Bonifacio, Makati, Rizal.
74)          Furthermore, we are implementing R.A. No. 3802 which grants tenants in all the PHHC’s housing projects the right to purchase their homes at cost thereby affording them the opportunity to become homeowners instead of mere lessees. As of last December, 617 families have been able to avail of this right. In furtherance of our housing program, the PHHC has sold, to date, 1,542 lots to prospective home builders.
75)          In addition, this Corporation is in the process of constructing six additional housing and sub-division projects in various provinces and has completed Housing Needs and Demand Surveys in various cities and towns in preparation for future activity.
Labor
76)          The Department of Labor in its role as conciliator has met with significant success. During the past three years, of a total of 1,572 cases which were terminated, 808 had the department’s active participation. Furthermore, it participated in most of the 918 bargaining agreements registered during the period.
77)          The past three years have witnessed a steady growth in unionism as proved by the 1,309 applications for registration of which 1,019 were issued corresponding certificates of registration.
78)          The Government is now embarked in implementing the new dimensions lent to our labor laws by the Land Reform program which extends the benefits of labor laws hitherto enjoyed predominantly by non-agricultural workers to agricultural workers as well. No less than 10,000 workers stand to benefit from Minimum Wage Order No. 1 which requires workers in the sugar industry to be paid P3.50 a day instead of P2.50.
Employment
Adding substance and meaning to the overall improvement in our economy is the gratifying knowledge that more Filipinos were able to find gainful employment over the last three years.
79)          From May, 1961, to May, 1964, there was a net increase of 1,178,000 in our employed labor force. During the same period, however, the labor force increased by 1,020,000. Thus, the unemployed to labor force ration dropped by 2.2 per cent from 8.6 per cent to 6.4 per cent. This is unmistakable proof that we have succeeded in arresting and even reversing our unemployment trend.
Minimum Wage
As the productive capacity of the economy grows, we should increase the earning power of labor. As a member of Congress, it was my privilege to be the main author and sponsor of the present Minimum Wage Law which fixes a minimum wage of P4.00 a day for workers. In the previous session, we recommended the raising of the minimum laborers’ wage to P6.00 a day or to such rate as Congress may deem just to both the laborer and the employer.
Social Welfare Administration
Child and family welfare continues to be the focus of the Social Welfare Administration since its ultimate aim is to achieve a higher state of well-being for individuals, families and communities. Implicit in this aim, however, is assistance to the destitute, the sick, the handicapped, the old, the homeless and the devastated.
The Social Welfare Administration has performed excellently during the past three years in spite of fund limitations that affect all government offices and in spite of the ever growing demands for its services.
80)          When typhoon “Lucille” struck in 1962, the SWA was the agency through which the sum of P14 million appropriated by R.A. No. 3467 was channeled to aid around 45,000 families, who were stricken victims of the typhoon.
81)          Moreover, the SWA has in recent years given material aid to the old, the handicapped, the sick and the needy, at a yearly average of some 70,000 cases. It has given rehabilitative and cash aid to 730,483 disaster victims and victims of dissident operations and other destitute families.
82)          Transportation aid was allowed to over 6,000 persons while financial assistance was given to over 2,000 self-help projects.
83)          It also rendered medical services to about 3,000 destitute patients a year and helped resettle over 1,300 families.
84)          Over the above this, the SWA handled an average 42,893 cases of families facing adjustment problems.
The task of screening the applicants for tenement housing called for by R.A. No. 3469 has likewise become this Agency’s responsibility.
National Integration
Through the National Integration Commission, the Government continued its efforts aimed at improving the living conditions of cultural minority groups numbering about 2.5 million people.
85)          During the past three years, gratifying improvements were made among the farm settlements where a total of 6,958 hectares were cultivated. In addition, 35,286 hectares were surveyed. We are glad to report that 5,452 families have been settled.
86)          The National Integration Commission built 33 kilometers of feeder and dirt roads and provided irrigation for 163 hectares in several reservations.
87)          The NIC has devoted a large measure of its resources and energies to afford education to many of its wards. Over the last three years, it awarded 2,780 scholarships. The Commission has supplemented this by erecting schools in settlements and the releasing funds to provinces with large cultural minorities.
88)          The Commission has released P33,405 for the construction of 12 Health Centers within the settlements which are staffed by Bureau of Health personnel.
COMMODITY ASSITANCE PROGRAM
RCA and NAMARCO
In line with our basic program of assuring adequate supply of basic commodities at prices within the reach of the common man, we have intensified the operations of the RCA and the NAMARCO of providing rice and other basic foodstuff at all times at reasonable and stabilized prices.
The NEC certified to an impending rice shortage for this year in the magnitude of 595,400 metric tons due partly to a series of unusually destructive typhoons which ravaged our crops. We are determined to find a solution to the problem of food shortage. We should not allow our people to go hungry. We trust that both houses of Congress share this sentiment.
89)          Primarily, we encourage domestic rice production by implementing a price support program through the RCA. This agency can claim the singular achievement of having raised the price of palay from as low as P8.00 per cavan to as high as P17.00 per cavan.
Nevertheless, the floor price for the rice support program of P12.50 is now inadequate and should be increased.
The palay growers being assured an adequate profit and incentive by the Government’s price support policy, it is our duty to assure the consumers rice and corn at all times at prices within their reach. Towards this end, the policy of government importation of rice until self-sufficiency is attained in order to meet any shortage in the domestic supply should be maintained. The authority of the Government to import rice to bolster the local supply in order to provide enough rice to the people at reasonable prices, not only in emergencies, should be restored. We should assure to the consumers, through a complement of local and foreign supply, at all times rice of at least the ordinary macan variety at not more than P1.00 a ganta.
The RCA’s other equally important effect is that it has been able to stabilize the price of rice instead of leaving both consumers and small producers at the mercy of middlemen and retailers.
NAMARCO
90)          The NAMARCO in line with its charter objectives imported and distributed during the last three years some $84 million worth of prime commodities such as canned milk, canned fish and canned meat, all of which were sold at or below landed cost to consumers throughout the country.
91)          At the same time, its distribution network was augmented with the appointment of over 14 thousand additional retail outlets. Through this wide marketing network, it was able to sell also locally manufactured canned food products in line with its program of assistance to domestic industries.
P.V.T.A.
92)          Since the start of our Administration, we have vigorously implemented R. A. 1194 which calls for government subsidy to stabilize the prices of tobacco and thus afford increased income to our tobacco farmers. We have done this despite the resulting heavy drain on government finances.
93)          We have also approved R.A. 4155 which improves the financing mechanism in support of the tobacco subsidy. Whereas before, the PVTA had to wait for releases from the Central Bank which resulted in prolonged delays in the payment of purchased and allocates about P80 million annually for this purpose. It likewise facilitates the gradual liquidation of PVTA’s enormous indebtedness with the Central Bank.
NEED FOR EFFICIENCY AND MORALITY IN GOVERNMENT
The Government is called upon to provide the major impetus to our social and economic growth.
For this reason we have striven to transform this Government into a flexible instrument of service; one that would be sensitive to the rising expectations of our people for a better life. This will explain our preoccupation with permeating all government offices and instilling them with integrity and efficiency.
Administrative Efficiency
We have pursued the objective of optimum efficiency in all government offices. Systems and methods were further refined and simplified and action guidelines laid down to minimize arbitrariness—a major cause of inefficiency and graft.
94)          Procurement and property disposal procedures were standardized and offices were more accessible to the public. The management system over Government property and records was revised. Due to all this effort we can claim that the present government machinery is in its most efficient and upright state since the Second World War; and we shall strive to improve it even further.
95)          An unheralded but typical example of our efforts for better public service is the “Operation Barrio Titulo” which was designed to deliver land titles otherwise lying idle in the Office of the Registers of Deeds to the very doorsteps of their rightful owners. From January 1, 1962 to September 15, 1964, no less than 19,519 titles have been distributed to farmers.
96)          The Civil Service Commission has been a major factor in this drive for greater efficiency. It has been instrumental in the dismissal of 177 government officials and employees and meting out lesser penalties to 477 others. Appointments made and approved in violation of Civil Service Laws and Rules were revoked. Performance ratings were improved and administrative discipline again became a reality to all government personnel.
Decentralization
Also important to the success of the Nation’s socio-economic program is the need for administrative reforms that would bring about more effective coordination among government offices and agencies commonly seeking the same objectives. Such administrative reforms could include decentralization of public powers to stimulate more participation in government by elective officials at the levels most proximate to the people.
Anti-graft Campaign
Realizing that efficiency and graft cannot coexist, the Government has intensified its exertions against erring officials and employees.
97)          Satisfied that corruption by high officials has been reasonably arrested, we have pursued our moral regeneration program to lower levels of government. Whereas the Civil Service Commission saw to it that only qualified men were assigned and retained in the service, the Presidential Anti-Graft Committee was assigned the task of checking, preventing and investigating government personnel and offices against charges of inefficiency and corruption. The Committee has caused the prosecution of 121 criminal and administrative cases. It has submitted 32 cases to the Civil Service Commission involving violations by public officials and employees of the Civil Service rules and regulations and performed investigations of anomalies and the evaluation of some 278 anti-graft cases.
However, strict control is held over this committee in order to avoid trespass against individual rights.
Anti-Smuggling 
98)          The Armed Forces has assumed a major role in the effort to curb smuggling. Over P51 million worth of smuggled goods have been apprehended and confiscated.
Smuggling, in its varied forms, constitutes a grave economic and moral threat to the nation. The solution of this problem requires the cooperation of all the people by not creating the demand for smuggled goods and in assisting in the apprehension of smugglers.
Accordingly, we have strongly recommended the creation of an Anti-Smuggling Office which would be able to coordinate an effective campaign against smuggling. Although we have gained headway in our campaign against organized smuggling, much has still to be accomplished in the way of eliminating this cancer which continues to corrode our economic and moral fiber.
NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW-ENFORCEMENT
Our program for national security calls for a minimum but capable force which can cope with any internal exigency and ready to respond t external challenges and commitments.
99)          The crippling blow to the Huk movement consisting of the captivity of Jesus Lava, was just a culmination of a three-year drive which netted a total of 699 Kuks and criminals either killed, wounded or capture in addition to the 1,632 others which saw fit to surrender. In the process, 4,472 firearms were rounded up.
100) Considerable headway was also made in combating cattle theft. Six hundred ninety-six rustlers were arrested and 1,544 animals recovered some 81 per cent of the total stolen.
101) Equally successful was the campaign against illegal fishing which resulted in the arrest of 2,675 persons and the confiscation of 82,149 blasting caps and 16,314 kilos of explosives.
Police Reforms
The dual function of maintaining the nation’s internal security and the promotion of peace and order has become the major responsibility of the nation’s armed forces. However, we feel that in securing peace and order, the greater responsibility should be shared by the country’s police forces.
Consequently, we should strengthen and improve our local police forces all over the country. We have recommended to Congress the enactment of a Police Reforms Law to ensure the fitness of those who are pledged to promote peace and order. We shall be happy to cooperate with Congress in the solution of this all important problem.
In this connection, we wish to commend the assistance being given by our civic-spirited citizens in combating crime, particularly the organization and active efforts of the Crusade Against Crime by Joaquin P. Roces.
NATIONAL PROSPECTS UNDER THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROGRAM
We have confined ourselves to statements of facts manifest in the progress of the Socio-Economic program for national development.
It may be recalled that when the Socio-Economic Program was presented to the Nation three years ago our overall target was an increase in gross domestic product at a compound rate of 5.5 per cent, as the unavoidable hesitancy that accompanied the transition to a decontrolled economy left its mark.
102) However, we are pleased to report to the Nation that for the second year of the Program, FY 1964, gross domestic product increased by 5.7 per cent, which is much closer to its target rate of 5.8 per cent; thus, the gap between achievement and aspiration is growing smaller.
The most immediate cogency and importance of the Socio-Economic Program of this Nation has been in being able to bring about a sense of prosperity which the tangible performance now promises to the Filipino people. The people are aware that what has been done so far are of immense implications for the state of economic and social institutions in the country. We feel that this sense of expectation has infused a new vigor to the Filipino people urging them to new heights of aspiration, giving them an assured basis for the steady vision of the good life and thus liberating the Nation from the lethargy that had held it as a consequence of the past colonial experience. A new condition of existence always proposes a new outlook and urges, in turn, greater strivings towards the ideals of increased social participation and responsibility.
Largely, this has been the moral implication of the Socio-Economic Program of the country to fight poverty through increased production. But in the greater political sense, it has also promoted an intense and responsible nationalism—a nationalism premised on the acceptance that while the Government must do all it can t enhance the general welfare, the state of the national society is a compendium of complex responsibilities in which everyone is to participate and exercise his right.
We believe that the Agricultural Reform Code has enhanced the faith of the Filipino masses in the Government, and by affirming the rights of the people in the face of an institution and social relationship established by the purposes of colonial regimes, the Agricultural Reform Code has provided the incentive for lawful assertions of individual rights, thus making it possible for the national society to conduct its various activities under the auspices of peace, freedom and security.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
In foreign affairs, our conduct has been characterized by stronger assertion and greater involvement in the schemes of the Afro-Asian community in general and in Southeast Asia in particular. Our moral and political role has been accepted in Southeast Asia, and we have found identity with the Afro-Asian Nations in aspiration and ideals.
Our emphatic belief in the justice of our cause pressed us to intensify the Philippine claim over Sabah.
103) Our claim has been bolstered by the written support of Indonesia and the formal commitment of Malaysia to settle it by peaceful means, particularly through the World Court.
We are hopeful that the other Governments affected by our claim over Sabah, being like us adherents to the rule of law, shall pay proper heed to our just position to settle the matter through the World Court.
Let it be stated in this connection, however, that we did not allow this issue over Sabah to keep our relations with Malaysia in a state of strain. Mutual steps have been taken by the Philippine and Malaysian governments to improve relationship in a common desire to minimize possible areas of conflict in this already troubled region.
R.P.-U.S. Relationships
On the whole, the conduct of our relations with the United States of America has been carried out in the traditional spirit of friendship as befit two nations which have close historical ties and share common ideals.
This has been eloquently confirmed by the results of my state visit to that Nation last October. On this occasion, the Presidents of both the United States and the Philippines held fruitful discussion over mutual problems.
104) We also took this opportunity to conclude a Tax Treaty for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the prevention of Tax Evasion.
105) In sympathy with our rice shortage, President Johnson donated on behalf of his Government, 25,000 tons of grain. He further pledged to make available 100,000 tons of rice to be purchased under the United States’ Pacific Law 480.
106) Let me also recall that it was under our administration that the late President John F. Kennedy signed into law U. S. Public Law 88-94 which amended the Philippine War Damage Act of 1962 and authorized payments of the balance of war damage reparations amounting to $73 million to some 88,000 claimants.
107) We would also like to point out the successful conclusion, early in 1964, of the Bilateral Cotton-Textile Agreement between the Philippines and the United States which resulted in increasing the quota of our exports of processed and manufactured textile to the United States. These and many other manifestations of effective cooperation attest to the existing firm basis of our relationship with the United States.
However, it has been almost two decades since we attained independent nationhood and world and national circumstances have changed considerably. The time has been reached therefore for treaties and relationships with the United States, which had been forged under conditions and events which are no longer present or intact, or whose compelling significance has greatly diminished in the face of current developments, to be scrutinized and updated in the light of present requirements for common security and benefit.
International Trade Promotion
The advent of decontrol stimulated a considerable growth in our exports and thereby necessitated the expanding of foreign markets for our products. To this end, we have intensified trade promotion efforts.
108) The Philippines signed an Executive Trade Agreement with Indonesia and concluded trade treaty negotiations with West Germany and Australia. A memorandum of Understanding with India was signed and discussions were held with the Korean Government to further improve the trade and economic relations between the two countries.
UNCTAD
Conscious of our problems as a developing nation, the Philippines participated actively in the United States Trade and Development Conference in Geneva last year.
109) during the conference, the Philippines was honored by the election of our head of delegation, the Secretary of Commerce and Industry, as one of the Vice-Presidents of the conference and who presided over four plenary sessions. Moreover, the Philippines was voted a seat to the World Trade and Development Board created to implement the resolution adopted by the conference.
ECAFE
In line with our policy to accelerate intraregional trade among Asian countries, Manila was made the site of the first ECAFE Ministerial Conference in December 1963 which adopted resolutions of far-reaching significance because they assured closer economic cooperation among the countries in the region.
United Nations
The grinding poverty of many nations and the terrifying progress of weapons development have given this world two crucial issues—the alleviation of misery of developing countries and the maintenance of peace.
In both issues, we believe that the United Nations and its agencies can and does play a paramount role. Because of this we have been and will persist in supporting and encouraging the activities of the United Nations and its agencies.
NEED FOR CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT
Under our constitutional system, the Executive and the Legislative share the common responsibility for administering the affairs of the Nation as well as providing the guidance, service and leadership required by our democratic way of life.
In view of this constitutional scheme of collective responsibility, we submitted to Congress at the beginning of our term a blueprint for national development known as the Five-Year Integrated Socio-Economic Development Program. By this program, we addressed ourselves specifically to the three-fold objective of accelerating the development of our economy, improving the living conditions of our people, and providing a strong basis of dynamic growth.
To bring about joint Legislative-Executive action for the implementation of this program of development, we recommended, during the 1963 session, the enactment of thirty-seven priority measures, including those affecting revenue-raising, and other economic stabilization and developmental measures. Only four of these measures were passed during the regular session of that year.
The enactment of the Land Reform Code required the calling of a special session.
When this Congress resumed its sessions in 1964, the Executive again recommended enactment of the measures which failed to pass during the previous session, including several other bills relevant to the achievement of our socio-economic goals. Of these forty odd bills, only seven became laws which were bills of peripheral nature not designed to solve our basic problems. The more important and urgent bills were not acted upon.
It cannot be gainsaid that we have, time and again, pointed to the pressing necessity for enacting the major measures which could have provided necessary support to our overall socio-economic program.
The non-approval of these measures has resulted in denying to our country and people the funds necessary not only for the various infrastructure projects such as highways, airports, harbors, irrigation and power system, but also the essential elemental services of health, education, food and shelter. With the accelerated demands of the people for governmental services, coupled with our rapidly expanding population, it is obvious that more funds should be made available to meet the expectations of our people.
The lack of revenues has resulted in the deferment of essential and important public services The public school building program, the development program for higher education particularly the University of the Philippines, the training and mobilization of reserves for defense, as well as the development of the dairy industry are among those awaiting implementation. In the field of infrastructure, the construction of vital highways, airports, harbors, waterworks and irrigation systems, and rural electrification projects suffer delay. The salary adjustment of government employees, the pecuniary benefits due to veterans, widows and orphans, the payment of teachers’ salaries and general financing and nationalized schools, the law enforcement and peace and order operations of the Constabulary, and the development of Mindanao, among others, have yet to be fully implemented.
Not only has the revenue inadequacy impaired essential and important services and denied needed support to the public role in our economic program but also has withheld credit facilities available in government financing institutions from the private sector.
This need for increased revenue was appreciated by previous administrations and Congresses. A review of revenue measures enacted form 1950 to 1961 or during the incumbency of President Quirino, President Magsaysay and President Garcia graphically show that these regimes were beneficiaries of a liberal and realistic revenue policy. The margin fee as well as upward adjustment in personal and corporate income taxes, specific taxes on liquor and cigarettes, sales taxes on luxury and semi-luxury items, fixed taxes on businesses, occupations and professions contributed immensely to the operating and developmental funds of these administrations. On the other hand, since our incumbency in 1962, not a single revenue-raising measure, except possibly the revision of the Basic Industries Act and the imposition of a minor tax on logs, was enacted by Congress. In contrast, various tax exemption measures were passed which further depleted the already limited sources of funds available. The socio-economic programming has been denied the financial support envisioned by its planners and architects.
Within our limited powers, but acutely responsive to the hopes and aspirations of our people, we proceeded with the implementation of the socio-economic program. But ultimate success cannot be achieved by Presidential action alone; complementary legislative action is indispensable. Such indeed is the mandate of our Constitution. We submit it to be the inescapable duty of Congress to participate in a dynamic program of nation-building and public service through the enactment of legislation which would insure our continuing progress and the people’s welfare.
The Filipino People and Philippine Politics
In the coming months, the Nation is apprehensive that politics will occupy priority in the plans and activities of our national leaders. This situation is indeed far from ideal—certainly not the proper approach to the needs and exigencies of the times.
In a sense, it is perhaps proper that the Filipino people should feel a stake in the issues of our politics. These are times of challenges. We have seen the emergence of an Asian country, Red China, into an atomic power with all its ominous consequences. Within the context of the national society, we have to make a choice, a choice of which the odds should indeed be foreknown; for if ours be to make a decision between economic progress and the achievement of the good life for our people on one hand and economic stagnancy and the perpetuation of our traditional social ills in the status quo on the other, then the preference needs no further debate: our politics must affirm the interests and welfare of the Nation.
We can with sincerity say that the decisions of the Administration have been solely guided by considerations of public welfare. We have not hesitated to cross party lines in the appointment of individuals to vital offices when it was deemed that the general public should profit from the merits of these individuals. In conformity with the traditional features of a democratic society, we have necessarily to stand on the platform of a definite political party but we have also pledged the commitment of this party not to a group or an institution but to the well-being of the whole Filipino Nation.
We appeal, therefore, to the patriotism of all our leaders and people to act in concert and cooperation, to continue the tasks that have already been done in the interest of all and to join the Government in the implementation of those projects and programs necessary to national growth and development. Political parties, if they are to be representative of the general will and interests, should not allow themselves to be divided on intentions that seek the betterment of human life in the national society. Whatever disagreements we have, on the interpretation of motives and the necessary means for the attainment of the public good, such disagreement nevertheless must not conceal the facts of achievement nor endeavor to obliterate the tangible work that has already been achieve.
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The national progresses which we have endeavored to present are the cumulative results of the program we outlined in this platform three years ago. As we enter a new year, we have a justified feeling that even as there are tasks to be continued, a perceptible degree of change and reform has already been achieve within the national society.
Of course, there are the recurring problems and the programs yet to be started which are aimed at enhancing the national life and elevating the level of general activities in our society. But it should be undeniable that we have already realized a stage of development and progress, and if we say that reforms and continued dedication are still required, it merely indicates that there is only the logical trend to be pursued but that the general premise of growth and advancement has successfully been established.
The burden of responsibility, however, continues, and in this, Congress must share shouldering the brunt. Some of the vital reforms needed and which we have indicated in this address would require legislative approval of necessary measures. We fervently hope that Congress will provide the necessary support and collaboration. For even as the Constitution has wisely provided for a system of checks and balances, it surely did not intend that the legislative and executive branches of the government be mainly concerned with checking and balancing each other to the prejudice of the national welfare.
The Nation has already been set into an impetus towards desired goals. We have established the basis and condition for consistent action and now, more than ever, the Filipino people—the masses that had risked their lives for a conviction and so that a nation might be established—now more than ever, they anticipate that their leaders should not betray their trust, but that, instead, should work in cooperation to further what has been done and to pursue the logic of the performance that has been accomplished in the past three years.
Two years ago, we had summed up the government accomplishments of a year by saying that what matters is that we know that we are moving; that the status quo, in response to what have been instituted, is changing and is transforming the relationships within the national society into a condition vibrant to progress and development.
It is for this reason that we have appealed for collaborative endeavors and joint responsibilities. Let us, once again, manifest a solid nationalism and present our position as a Nation before the world with the full powers that come from having a national purpose and integrity.
We are a young and developing democracy in a region in which the free way of life to which we aspire as the means to our welfare is not indigenous. As such, we continue to grow as a Nation.
Our people are now matured enough to realize what is good for them and their children, which includes a reasonable measure of continued self-denial and sacrifice when necessary to promote the success of the Nation’s fight against poverty. They have become aware that progress cannot be achieved by conflict but by cooperation among their leaders whom they have invested with their sovereign mandate. If we are to heed the sentiment of our people and become faithful to their welfare, we must endeavor, whatever our parties may be, to work constructively and harmoniously together not to promote our personal interests, political or otherwise, but to advance the progress of our country and the prosperity, well-being and happiness of the greatest number of our people.
Indeed, the critical need of our Nation at this juncture of our history when we are on the crossroad or threshold of vigorous economic growth is national solidarity and unity. Now more confident than ever in handling the country’s varied and complex problems because of our experience in the actual conduct of the Presidency, we shall endeavor to achieve to the utmost possible a maximum of national solidarity and cooperative endeavor with a minimum of partisan differences as the most effective way of serving the needs of our people.

TRANSCRIPT:
The State of the Nation Message of Her Excellency Corazon C. Aquino President of the PhilippinesTo the Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 27, 1987]
Mr. President of the Senate; Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives; members of both Houses of Congress; the Vice President and members of the Cabinet; the Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen:
Fifteen years ago, in this season of the year, my hus­band stood in the Senate and delivered what turned out to be the valedictory of Philippine democracy. He exposed the conspiracy to place the country under martial law, dissolve the Congress, and set the stage for the unremitting plunder of our patrimony and the degradation of our great name and honor.
The dictatorship’s last mockery of democracy was committed in this hall, where the loser was proclaimed winner of the snap election. Today, I join you in rededicat­ing this hall to true democracy. [Applause]
The route to these chambers was long and difficult, fraught with danger and paved with sacrifice. The electoral contest just completed has been exacting for all and bitter for some. But the nation has spoken. The complete leader­ship of this country has been chosen; the configuration of their powers and duties permanently set by the new Constitution.
An election is as much an expression as it is an exer­cise of the national will. We have been made instruments of this will. Our performance will bear witness to its wis­dom.
It is my duty under the Constitution to apprise you now of the state of the nation—but henceforth its con­tinuing progress shall be our common accountability.
The Economic Program
When I took power in this country 17 months ago, I was immediately called upon to deal with the dangerous combination of a severely distressed economy and a grow­ing insurgency; threats which fed on each other and on the hopelessness and confusion which prevailed. Production had contracted by 11% for two consecutive years, bringing unemployment rates to double-digit levels. Twelve percent of the labor force, nearly 2.6 million workers, were unemployed. (And up to now, 750,000 join the labor force every year.) Real per capita income had been set back 10 years. New investments had dried up and business con­fidence was at an all-time low. Interest payments on a $26.3 billion external debt took almost half our export earnings. And as I must stress yet again, no part of this debt benefited, or perhaps was even seriously expected to bene­fit the Filipino people. Yet their posterity to the third gene­ration and farther are expected to pay it.
Poverty blighted the land. Five million families (or 59% of the total) lived below the poverty line, as com­pared to 45% in 1971. Dictatorship had done nothing but make more of our people poorer.
It also made us sicker. The prevalence of malnutrition among our young and the incidence of birth fatalities had risen at alarming rates.
In short, I inherited an economy in shambles and a polity with no institutions save my presidency to serve as the cornerstone of the new democracy that we set out to build.
I had taken the oath to be president of a country that had lost everything, everything but honor. With that honor came a renewed faith in national leadership and in the ability of our race to change things for the better given the will and the courage to do it. [Applause]
I responded with an economic reform program aimed at recovery in the short, and sustainable growth in the long run. More concretely, it addressed itself to the basic prob­lems of unemployment and underemployment, and the consequent mass poverty.
The program calls for comprehensive structural reforms of the internal economy, complemented by no less im­portant external economic cooperation.
There are two basic features of this program:
The first is its comprehensiveness with respect to structural reforms. We have come to regard the scope of reform not as a problem, but as a challenge, as necessary as it is ambitious; and as realizable as the strength of our commitment allows.
The second basic feature is its reliance on the private sector to carry the main burden of growth. We have re­affirmed our faith in private initiative to propel and sustain our economy. Our premise is that, for as long as free market forces dictate the dynamics of the business environment, the private sector will respond aggressively. As a corollary, the program defines and limits government’s participation in the economy.
Internal Structural Reforms
The dictatorship gave special privileges to government corporations and select individuals. In their various forms, these enterprises had several things in common: They en­riched the few at the cost of impoverishing the many. They distorted markets and factors of production. And they bore the aspect of legitimacy that made challenge and change impossible.
We abolished these monopolies and special privileges and the effect was felt almost immediately. Fertilizer prices dropped 33% and farmgate prices of copra nearly doubled in 1986. We trace in part the renewed vigor in agriculture and the general economy to these and similar measures.
We committed ourselves to a fair and transparent trade liberalization program that is consistent with our country’s continuing weaknesses. Some 1,000 items were released, from a complex bureaucracy of licensing re­quirements, into a regime of rational tariff protection.
We removed price controls which had been an almost permanent fixture of the past regime. And yet inflation was less than 1% for the whole of 1986 and our estimates place it at an average of 1% for the first half of this year.
We instituted tax reforms to shelter the poor from onerous taxes and equitably redistribute the tax burden. We created an Asset Privatization Trust and a Committee on Privatization to start the divestiture of government control or participation in private business and, with the Sequestered Assets Disposition Authority, the SADA, to help fund the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program that I enacted last week.
External Cooperation 
Recession hit the international economy in the early eighties. Every economy suffered, but the heaviest toll was taken on the fragile economies of the developing nations. One of the worst hit was our own. The dictatorship had already borrowed heavily, exceeding the debt ceiling man­dated by law, when interest rates shot up. Meanwhile, a material portion of the debt had gone to projects that of­fered virtually no hope of payback. Conceived to either line pockets or inflate egos, these projects would never contribute to the repayment of the debt.
The domestic structural reform program we have initiated cannot be pursued in earnest unless the necessary financing is made available. Fresh funding is needed to effect adjustments in the industrial structure, to assist new ventures, and to support our social programs. This funding cannot come from the domestic economy. Low domestic incomes cannot generate the required savings. Meanwhile, debt service was taking half our export earnings. Rescue could only come from foreign sources, both official and private.
Our appeal for external economic cooperation was aimed at gaining increased flexibility in our domestic re­source management. The program required a reduction in our debt burden and increased support from bilateral and multilateral institutions. Simply put, we needed to buy time for our structural reforms to start paying dividends. And time is money. While a fool and his money are easily parted, we have discovered that our foreign creditors are not such great fools as the past leadership of our country.
It is my sad duty to report to you that the results of the recently concluded debt renegotiations are far short of our expectations and, more importantly, of our urgent needs. Let me put it bluntly. Our extraordinary achievement in fulfilling the first requirement of renegotiation, the estab­lishment of free and responsible government, gained us applause but no substantial accommodation from our foreign creditors. The saga of democracy had made great television, but no appreciable change on their business priorities. We were treated not much better than other debtors, even those who had rejected the austere discipline mandated by re­structuring. A discipline we had readily accepted. Incredibly, despite the significant reduction in country risk effected by the democratic restoration, we were not accorded the terms given other countries, which got longer periods, better rates, and greater latitude for growth.
We cannot help but feel that our foreign creditors took undue and unfair advantage of the internal difficulties we have with factions intent on subverting this government and destroying our democracy. Under the continuing threat of a cutoff in trade credits, which would have given new vigor and a signal to seize the moment to the enemies of democ­racy, we had to relent and sign the accord.
Nothing is more revealing of the tenor of the negotia­tions than the insistence that our government assume the liability of planters products to a consortium of banks. Their private risk would have to become our public liability. None­theless, the demand stood and provided the none too subtle coercion—sign or face the prospect of a protracted delay in the finalization of the debt restructuring program agreed to in March 1987.
We do not bow our heads in shame, for the shame is not ours. Yet even as necessity has forced our hand to agree­ment, we vow never again to let the patrimony of this nation lie at the feet of these noble houses that have finally shown the true face of foreign finance. [Applause]
For the record, our foreign debt stands today in excess of $28 billion. The increase from $26.3 billion when we took power is largely accounted for by the weakening of the dollar against major currencies. In the next six years, we shall have to pay $20.4 billion to our official and private creditors. Net payments could average 5% of our total output. Close to 40% of government expenditures and over 45% of our projected merchandise export earnings, or 27% of all foreign earnings, will go towards servicing this debt. The bottomline, honorable members of Congress, is that we have been left little room for domestic error. It is for this reason that I have yielded more to prudence than desire in the reform measures I have enacted. I have aimed for modest successes to avoid a comprehensive failure.
Still, despite our disappointments in this sector, I am pleased to report certain healthy signs in the economy. Re­cession bottomed out in late 1986. GNP posted a modest growth at 1.5%; significant nonetheless because of the previous two years’ negative performance. Exports posted a volume growth of 21.7% and provided the much ­needed boost. To be candid, as we must always be, fortuity can account for these improvements as much as the reform measures we had taken. For the low 0.7% inflation rate in 1986 was largely a reflection of the drop in oil prices and the prevailing weak demand and purchasing power.
Our reform measures, however, started to pay divi­dends in the first half of this year. Our estimate of first quarter GNP is 5.5%. Unemployment declined from 12% last year to 11.2%. The exchange rate remained relatively stable. And gross international reserves at the Central Bank stood at about $2.4 billion as of the end­ of June 1987, or the equivalent of five months’ merchandise imports.
What is important is that this time it is not the world market but a reinvigorated domestic economy that is paving the way to recovery. Investments reversed their contrac­tionary trend of the past three years. The 23% growth rate in investments promise a respectable real GNP growth for the rest of the year.
The current budget has a definite bias for health care, education and social services expenditures. Some 6.9 million people received food assistance from the Food and Nutrition Program in 1986. We began to expand the coverage of Medi­care. Teachers’ salaries were increased, and a leaner and more relevant curriculum was adopted. Some 5.2 million poor availed of vital services such as self-employment assistance, job placement, and family planning. For 1987, we have made P4.2 billion available for long-term mortgages in support of the national shelter program.
National Defense and Security 
The price of security and national honor, no less than liberty, is eternal vigilance. And that too has a price. Our country is threatened by totalitarian slavery on the Left and reversion to fascist terror and corruption on the Right. Meanwhile, the bottom is threatened by secession. On the bomb-shattered reviewing stand of our military academy, I vowed to end all threats to our democracy by the end of my term. We shall make good on that pledge. Meanwhile, it should be clear by now that no one in these struggles has had a monopoly of anguish and no one in these debates has had a monopoly of moral insight. It is in that light that we ventured to settle these issues outside the battlefield. For, surely, in the words of an architect of conflict and peace, “a society becomes great not by the victories of its factions over each other but by its reconciliations.” To this end, we shall continue to exhaust measures and avenues that will involve all our people in the task of moral and material reconstruction and national unity.
Still our march towards nationhood must be unde­terred and any threat to its progress will be countered with all the resources available to us, wielded with as much pas­sion as self-preservation can muster.
The application of force will be as effective as it is judicious. The operational thrust of our Armed Forces is predicated on deterrence, preemption, and destruction. But the question is: Can we execute? If we have come to ask our soldiers to do battle to secure our way of life, then we have an obligation to equip them sufficiently for the fight.
Having exhausted the avenues of negotiation, we have armed them with the right. Now we must complete the complement with the material, organizational, and physical wherewithal to accomplish the task.
We have directed our immediate attention towards strengthening the chain of command, reinstilling discipline within the rank and file, and upgrading morale in the Armed Forces. We have placed renewed emphasis on training—on the physical and mental readiness of the troops. Area Unified Commands have been established to facilitate force augmentation and complementation within and across the major services, particularly in areas where military operations are either imminent or ongoing.
We do, however, have a dire need to improve our intelligence, logistics, and communication services. Given our limited resources, we must improve our ratio of patrols to contacts, and our capability to maximize such combat opportunities as present themselves. We therefore need ordnance platforms and air transports for ground support, troop mobility, and medevac. We need a truly effective navy to secure our coastlines against fresh infusions of arms to rebel or fascist forces, and to punish any further attacks on our territorial honor and integrity, especially in the south.
Our Armed Forces are asked to do more for less. De­fense appropriations are down 1-and-1/4% of GNP from an average of 2% prior to 1986. We have been able to afford this reduction because of the moral victory we gained in the February revolution. Still, our defense expenditures are the lowest in ASEAN, and yet no country’s security is so seriously threatened as ours.
Given the realities of our finances and our priorities, we will continue to press for efficiency in the Armed Forces. But we will need a sober assessment of adequacy.
Some will say that force does not address the roots of insurgency. I will answer: Indeed, for such roots are ad­dressed by measures of economic improvement and equitable distribution. But such measures also need time to bear fruit; time that only feats of arms and negotiating from strength can buy us.
We have chosen to improve upon our capability to effectively manage force not so that we who desire peace could wage war, but rather so that those who would war upon us will realize, by the deadliness of our riposte, the virtues of peace.
Thus: “we shall bear arms when the intent of bearing them is just,” and, if necessary, we shall mourn our dead by celebrating the birth of generations whose legacy shall be one nation, free, upright, and prosperous. [Applause]
I have spoken of our problems and I have sketched our programs, some of which have already borne appreciable results. A more detailed report will be submitted to this Congress. Succeeding messages to Congress will convey the legislative agenda of my administration, particularly the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, whose Congressional complement is eagerly awaited. We have prepared the ground for Congressional action on autonomy in the Cor­dillera, and we are determined to achieve genuine autonomy, and thus eliminate completely the issues that divide us from our Muslim brothers in a manner consistent with the honor and integrity of the Republic. [Applause]
In deference to the Congress, Executive Orders issued last week have 1-year, 90-day, and 60-day effectivity dates. While we believe these measures merit immediate im­plementation, Congress may want a second look.
I would also hope that our proposed revisions of the Tariff Code and the rationalization of the government corporate sector shall be among the Congress’ first con­cerns, these being two areas that I find require the common counsel of executive and legislature.
I have also spoken of our continuing vulnerabilities.
Now let me speak of our strength.
The source of the new vigor and energy in the land is the sense of pride and renewed self-confidence of our people; pride in their unmatched political achievements. And flow­ing from that pride, the renewed confidence that we can improve things given the will and the courage to do what is right.
That pride and that confidence rest, however, on their continuing faith in the one solid and undeniable achievement of the great moral exertion of our people: the establishment of a democratic government under an honest and dedicated leadership. In short, it rests on their continuing faith in a government that will lead them to permanent peace, free­dom, and progress.
All the assaults on our government have fallen flat and harmless because the people believe in our government, in its honesty and sincere desire to work for the common good.
When this session opened, the great powers of the State that were united in my person divided, and a portion has flowed to you. I have felt no loss but rather a great sense of achievement. The great work we set out to do, for which the nation made me its single leader, is completed. We have this day opened the door of Asian democracy’s most famous home: the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines. [Applause]
With the portion of power that has gone to you goes the shared responsibility to maintain the people’s faith in government.
While I held total power in my hands, and even after I had scattered the enemies of democracy, I kept ever in mind that power and glory are fleeting. That, in times to come, in the words of Gandhi, “the people will not judge us by the creed we profess or the label we wear or the slogans we shout but by our work, industry, sacrifice, honesty and purity of character.” [Applause]
Inthe great debates that will ring in this chamber, remember also those words of Gandhi: “Insist upon truth by loving argument, by the testimony of your own life. Once you are assured of the truth, refuse to recant even to death. “
You are blessed beyond all Congresses of the past or of any other nation. For here, ever to guide you, are the somber shades of the eternal Senators of our Republic: Jose W. Diokno and Benigno Aquino Jr. [Applause] Even as their memory continues to freshen our sorrow, may their sacri­fices ever nourish our idealism and commitment to our people, and remind us of the painful lesson that “a govern­ment that is evil has no room for good men and women except in its prisons.”
This day completes the circle of our democratic achieve­ments. Now Philippine democracy rests solidly upon the three pillars of freedom: the President, the Supreme Court, and Congress. Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, members of the Congress, join me now in expressing our congratula­tions and deepest gratitude to those who have this day by God’s grace given to the nation the fully ripened fruit of freedom: ang ating mga kababayan, ang mamamayang Pilipino. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

FULL TRANSCRIPT:
State of the NationMessageofHer Excellency Corazon C. AquinoPresident of the PhilippinesTo the Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 25, 1988]
Mr. President of the Senate; Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives; members of both Houses of Congress; the Vice President and members of the Cabinet; the Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:
In fulfillment of my pledge to uphold and defend the Constitution, I stood here last year and divested myself of the power and authority to govern this nation single-handedly. The act seemed premature to many. We had only finished lay­ing the groundwork for recovery. The objectives of our poli­cies had yet to be achieved; their real consequences could not be known. We had done more clearing of the rubble than building on the ruins.
We had freed the spirit of enterprise which has accounted, far more than the direction of government, for the progress of our neighbors.
We had laid with speed and care, the foundations for a stronger and broader-based democracy. We had applied the first measures for the resurrection of a virtually dead econ­omy.
Memory will bring more vividly to mind than a recitation of statistics the devastation of our country then, the deep and sweeping poverty of the great mass of the people, the trauma of a wounded nation.
Many said it was not the time for divided counsel and shared government. It was too soon to venture into the world without the protection of the extraordinary powers I had inherited, and which I had sparingly used to steer the nation to that first day of full democracy: the inauguration of the Congress of the Philippines.
I ignored these counsels of fear.
It could never be too soon for democracy. I was almost proved wrong.
One month after I stood here and sounded a call for unity, the Right made its boldest and bloodiest move against the new democracy. With characteristic treachery, it lunged in the middle of the night at the heart of the Republic. While the attack was repulsed, the August 28 coup attempt almost wiped out the hard-won gains of a whole year and revived the nagging doubt that this country could have any future other than turmoil.
I called on the people to gather the scattered stones of the edifice and build anew.
Despite the great losses sustained, I felt no regret that we had completely restored democracy. For I had not been called to power to achieve economic progress at the cost of the ideals of the revolution that swept me into office.
To Make Democracy Work
My mandate was not just to make a country rich, but to make democracy work: to make it work as a system of genu­ine popular participation; to make it meaningful to the lives of the common people by giving them jobs and justice, work with dignity, health, and education, and reason to hope that the future will be better for themselves and their children.
I believed that nowhere could you find more effective cures for the ills of our country—such as the habit of oppres­sion, the inclination to corruption, betrayal of the public interest—than in the blessings of democracy: freedom; rights; transparent dealings; and a government of the people by the people themselves.
Despite the difficulties of democracy, we would bring to the prosperous state we sought, the freedom and dignity with which we had started on February 25, 1986.
How well we have succeeded, it is my distinct pleasure and pride to report. How far we have fallen short of our needs, it is our unavoidable duty to acknowledge and rectify.
No one can deny the obvious: The economy has taken off.
The economic indicators show it; the general feeling confirms it. The economy is on the move—not fitfully anymore but in firm strides on the path of sustainable growth.
GNP grew by 5.7% in 1987; by 7.6% in the first quarter of 1988. The source of this growth, on the sup­ply side, was increased industrial activity; on the demand side, by vastly increased consumer spending. The industrial sector grew by 8% in 1987; by another 9.7% in the first quarter of 1988. Manufacturing posted the highest growth since 1981, mainly in electronics and garments. The steep rise in primary energy consumption confirms the dramatic increase in economic activities. Oil consumption grew by 15.8%, and by an additional 9.2% this year. Our energy capa­bilities have begun to feel the strain—a sure sign of increased economic energy.
Unemployment dropped from 11.1% in the fourth quarter of 1986 to 9.5% in one year. One million six hundred thousand jobs had been created in 1987; well over a million of them generated by the private economy.
We have tracked this growth and found it accounted for mainly by small and medium businesses and by Filipino-­Chinese entrepreneurs, sectors that made few demands on the public sector, other than to be left alone to work in the democratic economic space we have created. We are seeing people­-powered capitalism in action.
People-Powered Capitalism
Unavoidably, growth exacted the price of inflation, which grew from 6.9% in 1986 to 7.4% at the end, of 1987. But even these figures compare quite favorably with a peak of 64% inflation in the last years of the dictatorship, when workers’ real wages plunged. In sharp con­trast, improvements in real wages in the past two years have enabled the working classes to cope with it. In manufacturing, workers’ compensation increased by 21%; minimum wages of nonplantation workers—the poorest—by 23.2%. Real wages of government employees increased by 11.2%.
We do not gloss over the fact that the number of unem­ployed who do not partake of these gains remains significant. Still, the improvement has been marked enough to explain the drop in the number of strikes since October last year. This confirms our belief that only economic progress can pro­duce enduring harmony in the workplace. The relative self­-restraint exercised by the labor sector in allowing the econo­mic recovery to proceed with a minimum of disruption under­scores the maturity, wisdom, and patriotism of the working classes and their leaders.
We lowered the duty on crude, and revised taxes on petro­leum products. We rolled back prices four times. And there are at present ongoing studies which we hope will result in a future reduction of the prices of petroleum products, particularly of kerosene, diesel, and LPG, on which the greater mass of our people depend.
To keep energy supply in step with the demands of eco­nomic growth, we have put energy development among our highest priorities. I shall set up an energy coordinating coun­cil, composed of the Executive Secretary and the heads of the National Power Corporation, the Office of Energy Af­fairs, the National Electrification Administration, and the Philippine National Oil Company, to keep track of develop­ments in this area. This should allay fears that we may outgrow our energy capabilities and choke the economic take­off.
The 1986 Tax Reform Program has apparently worked.
The increase of revenues from 10.6% to 12.2% of GNP reflects this.
To cut overhead and inject energy into the bureaucracy, I have directed Budget and Management to trim excess personnel from the head offices of the departments; at the very least to put a lid on new hires of overhead items.
The Privatization Program has generated P11.2 billion in gross revenues. The Program has proceeded less swiftly than interested parties may desire, but due care must be exercised in the disposition of assets that belong to the people. We must get the most we can for the people, in as fair and transparent a manner as possible, leaving no room for the smallest doubt about the integrity of the procedure and the people involved.
In spite of the clear guidelines I have set of transparency and open bidding, and against the urgent deadline for the privatization of certain major assets, some people still try to gain undue advantages. Let no one delude himself on that score. Those who fought with us in the campaign and revolution must remember that we fought to stop corruption of public officials and privileges to special friends. Let us not cash in on our patriotism in 1986. Let us rather be grateful to the nation and to the historical moment for the privilege we had of being heroes.
Let me return to the measures taken to spur the growth of the economy.
Decentralization
The dramatic improvement in rural purchasing power was accounted for by the Community Employment and Develop­ment Program or the CEDP and, of course, by the unexpected improvement in copra prices. The regions are forging ahead. Three of them—Region IV or Southern Tagalog, Region VII, the Central Visayas, and Region XI, Southern Mindanao—­grew faster than Metro Manila. Their great potential is only waiting to be tapped by capital investments, such as roads and communications, and by the devolution of decision mak­ing to the local level.
Thus, we have decentralized the operations of the 16 major government departments, and increased private sector representation in regional and local development councils to one-fourth. Budgets are now released directly to local govern­ments and budget priorities are now determined in the first instance on the provincial level. An increase of revenue allot­ments and repeal of mandatory contributions by local units to the national government will place more resources at the disposal of the local governments.
We have given them, for the first time in history, the prin­cipal initiative in the development of their communities.
We have marked out certain pilot provinces—at present, Davao del Norte, Laguna, Negros Occidental, and Tarlac—to which greater development efforts will be directed. The idea is to see what can be accomplished by an integrated and inten­sive approach in a specified area, and apply the lessons learned to other provinces.
Debt Burden
Great as our gains have been, we could have gone twice as fast and twice as far if we did not have one foot manacled to the debt.
Our external debt burden must be dramatically reduced. On this I believe all Filipinos are united. It should be understood that we cannot indefinitely give more than 40% of the budget for total debt service. We estimate a net payment to creditors of around $12 billion over the next five years. This is intolerable for a country whose basic needs are as acute as ours. I hope that message is clearly heard.
Yet we understand the realities of power, the vulnerabili­ties of the underdeveloped, and the ways of international finance. Debtors with shorter tempers who had stormed out of negotiations have been forced to return to the table, their economies having cracked under the pressure of isolation from the international system.
We must grow, yet maintain access to the international financial system. We must find ways of funding our growth without being held hostage to our debt. If we are to meet our commitments to our creditors, the bankers must first meet our financing needs.
Our debt strategy will be rooted in the recent recognition of industrial democracies that the management of the debt crisis is too important to be left to bankers. At the Toronto Summit, they singled out the Philippines as a country which needed support in its debt reduction efforts. Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita and U.S. President Reagan argued strongly for the extension of such support.
The world economy is held back by the debt that coun­tries such as ours carry. In 1987 there was a negative outflow of $2.2 billion to our foreign creditors. It was blood from the veins of our economy, and took a heavy toll in missed output and lost employment. We need a transfusion to maintain our growth.
The international initiative for a consortium of donor countries to support Philippine development plans could give us that transfusion. I welcome the support of world leaders for the economic development assistance program for the Philippines. We see innovative and far-reaching debt reduc­tion as a vital component of this international initiative.
Few countries, if any, have hewed as faithfully to the con­ditionalities of debt restructuring as the Philippines has. Our people have endured the most rigorous austerities, yet received no better treatment than those of countries that resisted. Yet, even as the realities of power force us to seek a just solution to the debt problem within the international financial system, those same realities may urge us someday to find that solu­tion anywhere we can.
Foreign Policy Review 
This has been a year of action on the foreign policy. In addition to hosting both the ASEAN Summit and the Newly Restored Democracies Conference, we have made state visits to China, Switzerland, Italy, and the Vatican. These trips have been part of an active process of strengthening and extending our international friendships. Our foreign policy should promote our assets in a way that strengthens us poli­tically, economically, and in terms of our security. Through the two conferences held here, we furthered our goal of broadening our friendships and making common cause with those who share similar circumstances to ourselves. We are even now engaged in the periodic review of one of our oldest foreign policy commitments, our hosting of the U.S. military facilities on Philippine soil.
New Army for Democracy
This may be remembered as the year the insurgency was broken. For the armed Left, it has been a year of defeats and retreats; a year of propaganda by terror rather than the stra­tegic initiative of which it had boasted. The rejection of our peace efforts restored to government the moral basis for war.
I wish we could still pursue the path of peace. Yet until the NPA and their friends come to trust their doctrines to the ballot box rather than the armalite, government has no choice except to defend our people with the gun.
Five members of the CPP central committee have been captured, eight regional leaders, 19 staff officers and 397 NPA regulars. More than 7,000 regulars and tens of thousands of mass activists and supporters surrendered earlier to the National Reconciliation and Development Program and AFP special operations teams. About 2,000 of the CPP-NPA were killed in action over the last year.
To all of you in this chamber today who are here because you won at the ballot box, democracy is beating back the challenge of the totalitarian Left. We are winning because we have given back to the people control of their lives and faith in the future. To that renewed hope we add the fresh vigor of a new army for democracy. Above all, we now have a future.
With the victories come responsibilities. The first is to keep open the door of reconciliation. These are our brothers and sisters but for as long as fratricide must be a national policy, this nation cannot be whole.
The second responsibility is to ensure an adequate level of security to our people. This means our Armed Forces must be supplemented by unarmed Civilian Volunteer Organiza­tions or Bantay Bayan, and Citizen Armed Force Geographic­al Units. Our armies cannot be everywhere and be expected to achieve decisive victories. We need civilians to assist in defending their communities.
Yet they must do this with the same respect for human lives and disciplined restraint we expect of our soldiers in dealing with noncombatants. Let us not lose the moral edge in this conflict.
This morning I instructed the Chief of Staff to begin the process of disbanding all so-called vigilante groups in line with the Constitutional injunction against paramilitary groups. Every measure must be taken to protect the people’s security against communist terrorism while the CVO or Bantay Bayan and CAFGU sys­tems are put in place.
Of equal importance as security against insurgent violence is protection against common criminality. From armed robbery to carnapping, our citizens live in intolerable uncertainty about the safety of their families and their properties. I ex­pect the military and police to arrest, not abet, this slide into criminal anarchy taking place right under our noses. Targets will be set and I shall relieve those who fail to meet our peo­ple’s expectations of peace and order.
I am conscious that history will judge the achievements of this government and the usefulness of democracy not through the narrow perspective of the business centers in Manila, but by our success in making a better future for all Filipinos. It is in the fields and barrios, in the slums of our cities, that we will ultimately be judged. It is our duty as elected leaders of this nation to describe a vision of the future that lifts up the lives of this, the great mass of Filipinos: those whose voices are not raised in business councils, social hap­penings, and in the opinion pages of the newspapers.
For them we must build a future that is based not solely on issues of foreign affairs or the volatility of business confidence, however important. What is the good of international harmony if it does not put food in the mouths of hungry children? Of what value is a business confidence that is built on the suppression of the legitimate aspirations of the poor? Rather, we must have an action agenda that meets their ur­gent needs in a simple and direct way.
Action Agenda
That agenda is straightforward:

Education;
Jobs;
Alleviation of poverty; and
An economy that can sustain these goals.

Ours is renowned as the people-powered democracy. As we must live by the decisions of the people, we must ensure the quality of those decisions. Provision for education in the 1989 budget is increased by more than a third—an essential investment in the future. Free high school education led to a record enrollment of 2.3 million students. Yet, we have far from achieved a universal education. Only 70% of our children attend elementary school; of these, only 60% complete it. Unless we act decisively now, we face a future of rampant functional illiteracy. Then we shall have people with­out power.
This is the real national emergency, for what is involved here is not underutilized manufacturing capacity or insuffi­cient incentives for the rich, but the very quality of the Fili­pino who symbolizes the great Asian miracle: a revolution without blood; democratic restoration without tears.
The second priority is jobs. For this we must accelerate economic growth. We expect GNP to grow by 6.4%, and investments to pick up at a strong rate. The industrial sector is likely to grow 9% this year.
Central to our strategy for improving rural incomes is the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program whose highest aim, I must stress again, is not mere land redistribution, but higher productivity from the land and a higher standard of living for the farming communities that are the backbone of our nation.
I signed into law the fruit of your long efforts, the Com­prehensive Agrarian Reform Bill, reflecting your wide knowl­edge and experience of conditions in the countryside.
We are increasing the expenditure for infrastructure by 50% percent, most of it to be poured into the countryside. We expect to double our spending on water supply. P1.3 billion has been budgeted for school houses.
By 1992 we intend that

three-fourths of the entire road network will be all­-weather compared to less than 50% at the beginning of this year;
92% of the rural population will have clean water compared to 62% this year
there will be enough classrooms for all children of school age;
a multipurpose concrete road in each of the 46,000 barangays in the country, serving not only as a road but as a grain drying surface; a recreation area; as the first solid evi­dence in these difficult to reach places that here finally is a government truly their own.

Our fight against poverty includes meeting basic needs like health care. We will intensify public health programs and pursue the various drug policies that will make essential drugs more accessible and affordable.
We must achieve a viable consensus on an authentic family welfare program that is responsive both to the Constitutional mandate and the challenge of a growing population.
The provision of basic services also includes making tele­phones available to all communities. For a country separated by geography but driven by market forces, the social and eco­nomic cost of poor communications is too high.
With your congressional leadership I have agreed on cer­tain legislative priorities that reflect the national agenda I out­lined today.
On the economic front, we must provide long delayed in­centives to the sectors that have powered our recovery, particularly the small and medium enterprises.
On the peace and order front, the urgency of a national civilian police force is obvious, and is high on your agenda as well, along with measures enhancing protection of human rights. Our other priorities are improved civil service effective­ness, education, population, social justice, the environment, the establishment of an independent central monetary au­thority, and the issue of a metropolitan commission to assure basic services in the hub of economic activity in our country: Metro Manila.
Time for Action is Now
A more detailed list will be submitted. A common agenda should be easy to arrive at. What is more important is implementation of policy. The time for planning is over; the time for action is now. A lot has been done, but it has barely scratched the surface of the problems.
At the end of the year in which the middle class has be­come better off, I now say this to my department heads: Bring more of the new prosperity to the common people, produce concrete results on your department programs—or you are out. [Applause] Ours was a revolution for all Filipinos. Our poor have waited long enough. No sluggard will be allowed to stall the economic takeoff.
Rediscovering National Purpose
Let me sum up:
It is liberty that has brought us progress; freedom that has generated growth. It is democratic space that has brought the insurgents down. But there is another side to freedom, where abuse displaces responsibility.
We have too often descended to mutual abuse, suspicion, and recrimination in our political life. Far from respecting each other’s positions, we have been quick to question each other’s motives, We are losing the trust that held us to­gether and gave us the strength to prevail. We are forgetting that we stood together to win this freedom that is now too often demeaned. We must find again that trust and that strength, for the task is far from complete.
That trust comes from expecting the best of each other, and equally from giving our best. [Applause] Across our country, millions of Filipinos are doing that everyday: giving the sweat of their brows and the strength of their arm, above all their ingenuity and energy, to make a better future for us all. Those who stand on the pinnacles of power should be shamed by the more earnest commitments of those who labor anonymously below.
We complain of a lack of national purpose, but if we are big enough in ourselves and in our dealings with each other, we will rediscover it in ourselves and our countrymen.
It was a year when we faltered in this search; when losing faith in ourselves we listened to others, whether to those who say our nationalism is flawed or those who take it upon them­selves to instruct us that our future confidence as a nation rests entirely on whether we do, or do not, keep the Ameri­can facilities after 1991.
Our nationalism should stand upon a larger ground than the hectareage of the bases; it should turn on something high­er than the insults of short-time journalists.
Do not let anyone dictate to us where our national pride should be. We know where it lies: in a sense of our past and a sense of our destiny; in the confidence of what we can make of this nation when we are united again by trust.
We saw what can be. A vision was born in EDSA. A vision of the future, of a people standing together, not just for four days on a highway, but on and on as a nation.
Nakita natin kung ano ang maaaring maganap. Isang lara­wang diwa ang isinilang sa EDSA. Isang larawang diwa ng sam­bayanang nagkabuklud-buklod na nanindigan, hindi lamang sa loob ng apat na araw sa isang karaniwang lansangan … kundi isang bansa … magpakailanman.
Maraming salamat po. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Messageof Her Excellency Corazon C. AquinoPresident of the PhilippinesTo the Congress 
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 24, 1989]
Mr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; members of both Houses of Con­gress; Mr. Vice President and the members of the Cabinet; the Chief Justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:
Pursuant to the Constitution, I have come to report on the state of the na­tion. This recurring event, however, has another significance today. For it comes midway in my term of office. It is time to review what has gone before, how things stand today, and what must be done tomorrow.
Three and a half years have passed since the revolution. Recalling the perils we passed, and the ground we have covered, I marvel at the kindness of God and the strength of our people—at the fortitude and ingenuity of a race that did so much with so little, and in so short a time.
We revived a dead economy and in three years had it well on the road to recovery. The figures are well-known and unimpeachable, yet some bear repeat­ing.
Industrial capacity, idle for lack of capital, markets, and confidence under the dictatorship, has been fully utilized. In the past two years, investments have increased 25% annually. P30.97 billion was invested in 1988. Industry grew by 8.6% in gross value added last year, improving yet further on the already im­pressive growth of 7.7% in 1987.
The number of business enterprises increased by 38%, most of them small- and medium-scale and located outside Metro Manila.
More than 2.3 million new jobs have been created. Unemployment declined from 12.5% in 1985 to 9.6% in 1988.
Last year, we posted a 6.7% growth. This year, we anticipate less because of a slight contraction of the world economy and the shift from consumer-led to the more substantive but slower investment-led growth that we see as the safer course to take.
The economic upturn is reflected in the reduction of industrial actions. The exuberance of a suddenly liberated labor sector has made room for a deeper appreciation of the need for all sectors to work together—rather than against each other—for the general improvement. Let us not, however, use the reduction in strikes by itself as an invitation to more investments, but rather as a barometer of the more equitable distribution of the progress we are making. We are instructed by this welcome development to work towards even greater equity in the distribution of wealth as the surest means to social order and peace.
Our greatest investment in enhancing national productive capacity is in education—in developing the intelligence and the sinews of our people, as it were.
Thus, we have put 98% of school-age children in school; we are close to universal elementary education. The universal free high school program is also well under way. Ouantitatively, we are close to our targets; qualitatively we are far. A rigorous and high quality secondary education, the Japanese and Ger­man experiences teach, is the foundation of a modern economy.
Last year, 70.9% of all infants one year old or younger were immunized, representing 1,318,000 babies—a dramatic improvement over 30% in 1985; 7.7 million children were treated for various illnesses. Our aim, as we said, is shar­per minds and sounder bodies for the next generation of Filipinos.
Economic Recovery and Poverty
Yet poverty remains prevalent. The lowest 30% of our population remains mired in unchanging misery. They think nothing has changed and I don’t blame them. Liberty is a poor substitute for food. The economic improvement we have experienced has had some impact on the incidence of poverty, which declined from 59% in 1985 to 49% in 1988. But the 500,000 families who crossed the of­ficial poverty threshold may not even be aware of it.
The economic recovery has restored old fortunes far more significantly than it has touched the lives of the vast majority of our people. For all that, we can­not downplay our economic progress. For it has spoken more eloquently to the world than words ever could. It has earned us tremendous respect throughout the world. This was shown in the Tokyo Consultative Group meeting which paid tribute to the country’s growth with low inflation, despite the debt. A similar respect was evident throughout my European visit. My hosts were clearly en­couraged to support what they saw as a record of success against great odds. We have been working to translate this respect into concrete support to reduce those odds.
Yet nothing generated greater admiration than our political achievements.
In little over a year, we uprooted a dictatorship and planted the freest democracy in the world—with all its good and bad features. We held elections that were the freest and most participative in the history of this—perhaps of any—republic in the world.
Our swift democratization was done against the advice that I reserve emer­gency powers in the face of rising military adventurism and communist terrorism. But I believed then—and time has proved me right—that this nation shall find no greater source of strength to defend democracy than in the enjoyment of all its rights and liberties. Democracy is our faith and the root of our strength to defend it.
Added to that faith was the will to stand for no more nonsense from military adventurers who thought that failure to shave qualified them for national leader­ship. Some people don’t like the way I dress. Well I didn’t like the way they looked. I am in power and they are out. [Applause] Surely there is a lesson here to be learned about delusions of self-importance and the realities of power.
Peace and Order
My assessment of the peace and order situation is mixed. With regard to the insurgency, the tide has turned—I believe—permanently. The main weapons were democracy, a greater concern by government for rural needs, the economic recovery, a heightened respect for political and human rights, and a deeper commitment to their proper mission on the part of the Armed Forces. The AFP reports an 8% reduction in NPA troop strength. A better indicator is the brutality with which the Communist leadership has treated the common people and even their own ranks. This self-destructive course reveals a move­ment whose organizational and moral center has ceased to hold. This picture of disarray is both good news and bad. For we must brace ourselves for greater cruelties from a cause that is now indistinguishable from a common crime. In summary, we have beaten the insurgents less by fighting than by the example of our humanity, our concern, and the impact of our economic progress.
On the subject of common crimes, the situation is nothing less than terrible. What compounds it is the general distress occasioned by the prominence of military and police elements in the worst criminal activities. The first duty of the State is the enforcement of order. Until we—the executive, the Congress, and the judiciary—bring the situation totally under control, none of our accomplish­ments elsewhere will have a lasting impact on the opinion of the public. For criminality threatens the most basic rights of man—the right to live, to raise a family, and enjoy and bequeath the prosperity he has worked for.
The Challenges Ahead
I recall our achievements not to make the past compensate for the present nor to excuse inaction in the future, but so we do not lose faith in the essential strength of our race to rebuild, to recuperate, to grow, and to meet the challen­ges that lie ahead.
There is the challenge of rising world oil prices that threatens to undercut our continued growth.
There is the challenge of continuing debt service that eats 40% of the na­tional budget, or 7.7% of GNP. We are expected, in the next five years, to make a net payment to our creditors of $12 billion or approximately P260 billion at the current exchange rate.
There is the challenge of sustaining growth and meeting our medium-term targets.
And there is the age-old challenge and threat that poverty and under­development pose to the viability of democracies in the Third World. How long can we stay poor and still be free?
Poverty has lessened but 5.3 million households or 29 million people remain poor. Unemployment has been reduced but try telling that to the 2.9 million still jobless and the 7.2 million underemployed.
What Must Be Done
For these reasons, we critically need to sustain economic growth.
First, we have to strengthen the foundations of a vigorous market-oriented economy. This would involve continued adherence to prudent fiscal and monetary policies and reliance on market forces in the functioning of the economy. These policies have engendered robust growth of private investment, output, employment, and consumption. These have also kept inflation at accept­able levels and helped protect the real incomes of wage earners. Our record of high growth with low inflation is a singular achievement among heavily indebted countries.
We must steer away from the siren songs of quick fixes, easy spending, un­warranted subsidies, and irrational price controls, which elsewhere have contributed to bloated deficits, tailspin hyperinflation, and social instability.
Second, we must go on building structures essential to the efficiency and productivity of the economy. Government has improved or constructed 1,124 kilometers of major roads and 7,821 kilometers of secondary and feeder roads to bring markets and producers closer to each other. Yet this is a small part of the projects in the pipeline—numerous ports, power generation plants, and modern telecommunications.
Third, no less important than physical infrastructure, we must continue to strengthen our public institutions and find ways to do things better, faster, and with the greater appearance and substance of integrity. I have a few words to say on the subject of corruption. Yesterday, a pastoral letter was read in all the churches deploring the resurgence of official corruption. How can the Cabinet, the Congress, and the Supreme Court deny what is plain for all to see: that cor­ruption is again a way of public life?
I will not preempt a Congress that feels its time is better spent in investiga­tions of anything, nor a Supreme Court that has a longer backlog of unresolved cases than there are decisions in the casebooks from the turn of the century. I have my own responsibilities to face, and my own people to hold to account. [Applause]
The magnitude of unresolved disputes has frozen innumerable billions of pesos worth of assets in litigation. The staggering number of unsolved crimes has eroded the credibility of the state to be respected as such.
The problem is massive for having been left unattended by the branch of government, and the departments and agencies specifically charged with the dispensation of justice and the punishment of crimes. But a start must be made.
I have ordered a review of the structure and performance of the National Bureau of Investigation with a view to making it the lead arm in criminal inves­tigation. I have ordered a review of the prosecution service, and call upon the Supreme Court to do the same to the judiciary, with a view to relieving the in­competent and the passive who have allowed so many cases to languish unresolved.
A Clean and Honest Government
I am tired of being taken to task for the thing above all others that I wanted to leave as a legacy: the example of a clean and honest government. To my fel­low workers in government specifically involved in this area—and in all other areas as well—let me say that unless the public sees results soon, it will be good­bye for you. [Applause]
The compassion that marked my administration in the past may generate doubts about my resolve in this matter, but the actions that will be taken by me in the next weeks and months will dispel them all. [Applause]
Fourth, as the lynchpin of our efforts to lift the mass of our people from poverty, we must implement agrarian reform with greater vigor, doing our best to combine speed with the necessary caution. I would like to stress again the aim of agrarian reform. Our objective is not merely to subdivide the misery of the land, but to raise the living standards of our farmers to the level of their dig­nity as the backbone of our economy.
Fifth, for our development to be at all sustainable, we need to redress the years of degradation and neglect of our environment, and preserve what remains of our natural resources. We have embarked on projects to restore and conserve our marine and forest resources—among them the largest reforesta­tion program in history, covering 100,000 hectares a year to the end of the century.
Sixth, we must mobilize the resources, both domestic and foreign, neces­sary to sustain public and private investment and provide basic social services. To generate domestic resources, vigorous tax collection efforts, banking reforms, and the development of capital markets are under way. Measures to enhance public confidence in the stock markets are needed and I look to the Congress to study and initiate them.
Improving Tax Collection
I cannot overemphasize the importance of improving our tax performance.
We have one of the lowest tax-to-GNP ratios of any country in the world. No longer can we tolerate tax evasion as a national pastime, especially of the rich, when indeed our economic future is at stake. The place for tax evaders is not high society but behind bars. [Applause]
As regards external financing resources, except for one component we have installed a financing structure which will support sustained growth.
We are currently engaged in negotiations with commercial creditors for a package that will support our external financing program. An important ele­ment of this package will include debt and debt service reduction schemes inspired by new debt initiatives. By firm adherence to its strong record of economic adjustment and performance, the Philippines is particularly well placed to be favored by these initiatives.
With the endorsement of the multilateral institutions and foreign govern­ments—and in the conviction that we have done our part in keeping our economic house in order—we shall negotiate forcefully to secure the cooperation of the commercial banks in the Philippine recovery. In the riot-torn streets of Caracas, in the teeming barrios of Mexico, in our own barangays—no less than in Washington, Tokyo, and Paris—there is growing recognition that something real must be done about the Third World debt.
Let us not forget that we have come from a 20-year struggle between our people and a dictator, and that we are here engaged in the reconstruction of an economy and a polity as though from the ruins of war. Except the destruction has been more sweeping. We did not emerge from the Second World War with losses anywhere near the $28 billion being exacted by our creditors.
Rural Development
Our principal focus must be on rural development-the liberation of the economic, social, and political energies of the countryside. We need the physi­cal infrastructure to link rural production and consumption with the national and international economies. We need to enhance education and health to make the best use of our best assets—our people. We need to decentralize political structures to widen the people’s participation in national life.
A people-powered revolution must aim for a people-empowered democracy and economy. Rural development will best realize this aim. The al­leviation of poverty will come with the upliftment of the rural poor.
Unless we draw our rural areas into the dynamics of the national economy, turning hinterlands of decay into frontiers of progress, our growth and equity goals will not be attained, neither in the short nor the long term.
Law and Good Government
The great task that we have set ourselves will require two great instruments of social transformation: a just but iron-fisted law and good government.
There will be no progress in our communities without order, without secur­ing the lives and properties of our citizens against criminality and the insurgency.
I have already noted the progress that has been made against the insurgen­cy. The increasing isolation of the rebels has allowed military operations to succeed as never before. But such operations must take greater care to avoid collateral damage to the civilian population. For our moral ascendancy has ac­counted for the greater part of our superiority in this conflict. The protection of human rights even under conditions of conflict must be a key consideration in military operations and missions.
Our other great task is to deliver good government. This, I believe, consists of maintaining closeness to the people, honesty and efficiency in their service, and making a difference for the better in their lives. Thus, I have brought an active presidency to bear on the many issues that shape our lives from police work to women’s concerns, from improving customs collections to disaster relief operations. I have brought the physical presence of the presidency to 54 provin­ces, from Tawi-Tawi to Batanes.
Dedication and Discipline
I shall emphasize even further the standard of my example by exacting the same dedication and discipline—from my Cabinet, the bureaucracy, and the local governments. A quarterly review of departmental performance shall become the forum for diagnosing the strengths and weaknesses of programs and per­formance, and the basis for the proper remedies.
I expect to see the departments pull together in more coherent and focused efforts to advance policies and programs across the board, and to translate this address into action. The process should involve the participation of mayors and governors, and consultation with members of Congress.
On local autonomy and decentralization, it was never my intention to sub­stitute the abuses of overcentralization with widespread incompetence in local leadership. Our people will simply regard both as our failure. Thus, as we devolve greater authority and resources to local governments, we shall exact from them greater responsibility to their communities and more support of the national objectives.
I call also on the support of constitutional bodies, such as the Civil Service Commission, the Commission on Audit and the Ombudsman. Even as they per­form their duties with the required independence and integrity, let them be reminded that good government can be achieved as well by cooperation as by adversarial relations. The purpose of checks in government is not to induce paralysis but to achieve balance and foster progress.
As we emerge from a singular preoccupation with economic recovery, we must remind ourselves of initiatives that will have a major impact now and profound implications tomorrow. Three particular priorities are: the protection of the environment, the promotion of family planning and responsible parent­hood, and the development of science and technology.
While the lead in the environmental movement must be taken by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, responsibility must be as­sumed by all of us. While the Department of Health is the designated lead agency for family planning, we should all contribute towards building the fami­ly as a purposeful act of confidence in the future. The Department of Science and Technology needs to bring academe, government and business together in promoting science and technology.
Agenda for the Future
Our gains in the past three years serve as the base for launching a com­prehensive advance on all fronts. The scale of the effort and the importance of the outcome call for the wisdom of Congress to consider and affirm these in­tentions. I propose the following:
First, measures to alleviate poverty:
1. Tax and other incentives to small and medium countryside business enterprises;
2. Authorizing the bidding out to the private sector of BOT projects, or projects to build, operate, and transfer self-liquidating infrastructure projects; and
3. Promoting countryside investments.
Second, measures to improve peace and order:
1. Immediate creation of a civilian national police force;
2. Limiting discretion in the disposition of seized importations;
3. Penalizing the crime of plunder to deter the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth by public officials; and
4. Further protecting human rights.
Third, measures promoting honesty and efficiency in the government:
1. Devolution of more substantial powers to local governments;
2. Doubling the financial resources of local governments effective 1990 by increasing internal revenue allotments, granting incentives for im­proved real estate tax collections, and abolishing mandatory contributions to the PC-INP and hospitals;
3. Reorganizing and strengthening the Philippine foreign service.
Fourth, measures promoting social justice:
1. Defining ancestral domains;
2. Providing a more extensive program of urban housing development;
3. Setting ceilings and limiting deductions on travel, representation, and other expenses;
4. Encouraging cooperatives; and
5. Rationalizing small-scale mining.
Finally, measures for the protection of the environment:
1. Increasing forest charges;
2. Increasing penalties for pollution; and
3. Adopting a national land use plan.
Finally, I seek your support for the 1990 budget that I shall be submitting in the next few days. I ask you to consider our proposals in light of the priorities I have outlined, and the deep concerns that we all share for the upliftment of our people from poverty, and of our nation to progress. I ask you to regard with sympathy and understanding my deep desire and my unshakable resolve to give our people all that I have promised them. Let me make myself especially clear on this point: I shall complete the work that we have started, the work that God gave us to do—to make a new nation, strong, and free, and prosperous. I shall not rest from that labor until its fruits have been enjoyed by you, by me, and by all our people. Only success will stop my unceasing efforts, my undying commitment to the great task before us.
God bless us all. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! [Applause] [Standing ovation]

TRANSCRIPT:
MessageofHer Excellency Corazon C. AquinoPresident of the PhilippinesTo the Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 1990]
Senate President Jovito Salonga; Speaker Ramon Mitra; distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan and associate justices of the Supreme Court; members of the Cabinet; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; distinguished guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:
We gather today at a most crucial time in our history.
Seven days ago, a large portion of our country was rocked by one of the most serious natural calamities we have ever expe­rienced: an earthquake which registered at magnitude 7.7 in the open-­ended Richter scale, and intensity 8 in the Rossi-Forel scale near the epicenter. The tremor struck at 4:26 in the afternoon. After 45 seconds, 9 of our cities and 39 municipalities in 15 provinces lay damaged; some, almost totally devastated.
As of this morning, based on the NDCC reports, we have accounted for 899 fatalities, most of them from the cities of Baguio and Cabanatuan. We have counted 3,061 injured with Dagupan City suffering the worst—actual property damage recorded so far is P2.6 billion. But we estimate the total damage to properties to reach from 10 to 15 billion pesos.
I personally visited Cabanatuan, Baguio, and Dagupan, sites of the heaviest damage to lives and property. There I saw and experienced for myself the grief that death and loss summon from our hearts.
But it was not sorrow alone that was present in those disaster sites.
Amid the debris, I saw the strength and courage; I witnessed the selfless­ness and heroism of our people. In the midst of devastation, there is the will to survive; to help others; to rebuild; to start anew.
By the grace of God and the unshakeable faith of the Filipino people, I am confident we will pull through.
Yes, once again, we face a crisis.
But you and I and the rest of our people are not strangers to this. Since time immemorial, natural and man-made calamities have visited our land—bringing with them widespread death and destruction.
And always, our people would rise from the rubble. We would shake off the dust and wipe the tears. And while we mourn our losses, our hope for the coming of a new day never dies.
Earthquakes can destroy the strongest man-made structures; but they can never shatter the faith of the Filipino.
To this day, rescue and relief work goes on. But slowly and surely, our countrymen are gearing up for the next important task—that of reha­bilitation.
Our people are determined to go back to their normal lives within the next few days. Our farmers want to return to their fields. Our labor force wants to return to their workplaces. Our businessmen want to resume the conduct of trade and commerce.
Today they are no longer asking us for gestures of pity. They are asking for assistance—to help them get back on their feet.
I therefore come before you today to ask you to work hand in hand with me in the effort to restore the normalcy of our people’s lives.
There is, however, more that I would like to ask of you today. Let me ask you to look beyond rehabilitation and share with me instead the vision of the building of a much stronger nation.
For while this is a time for grieving, so is this a time to survey the opportunities arrayed before us—the opportunity to grow further in our maturity as a people; to leave the mistakes of the past and build on our strength; to abandon the hatred and the division and to start afresh as a people tested by suffering, faced with the options for a better tomorrow.
At this point, we must ask; where shall we draw the needed fortitude to maximize these opportunities?
From where I stand, I see four sources.
First, our gains over the past four years.
Second, the strength and courage that our people have demonstrated during this calamity.
Third, the avenues for partnership among people and government that we have established.
And fourth, our abiding faith in God who has always cared for us.
May I invite you to examine our gains.
Last year, our nation bustled with productive energy.
The 5.7 percent growth in our economy was well within target.
A total of 17 billion 480 million pesos in foreign investments poured into our country, 75 percent more than the previous year, evidence of the continuing confidence of the international community in our economic recovery.
We reduced our foreign debt by 4.3%—from $27,800,000 in 1988, down to $26,600,000 as of January of this year.
Our stock exchanges registered a business volume of more than P22 billion, unmatched in the history of our country’s stock market.
1989 was definitely a banner year.
Some 703,000 Filipinos gained access to new jobs as the unemploy­ment rate in our country went down to 9.2%, from the 9.6% registered in 1988.
The annual per capita income of our workers rose by 3.3% as we moved to ensure that no government worker would receive a salary lower than P2,000; and to increase the minimum wage in the private sector by P25 per day.
91,349 more Filipino families were able to build homes last year, the fruit of a vigorous housing program with an unprecedented record. Last year’s mark brought the total number of our beneficiaries from 1986 to 1989 to 193,735 families. This shows our ability to provide new homes for an average of 64,578 families every year, surpassing the record of 1975 to 1985, where an average of only 28,543 families were given shelter annually.
Over 1 million schoolchildren, including those living in remote barangays, benefited from the 26,406 classrooms. constructed last year.
2,503,794 high school students benefited last year from our free public secondary education program. In addition, 101,000 more young Filipinos were able to attend high school last year. These are the students who cannot be accommodated in our public high schools but whom we assisted through service contracts with private educational institutions.
In February 1986, the lowest paid teachers, or those in Teacher Level 1, were receiving only a measly basic salary of P1,096.00 plus allow­ances of P350.00.
In recognition of their crucial role in the upbringing of our youth, together we endeavored to raise this pay level. Today, our teachers in the lowest bracket are receiving a total of P3,102.00, plus additional compen­sation paid from the local funds of the local government units where they serve.
In February 1986, the highest paid teachers, or those in the secondary Principal 4 level, were receiving only a total package of P2,393.00. Today, that has been raised to P7,478.00.
Some 1,407more kilometers of major roads and 4,890 kilometers of feeder roads were constructed last year. This brings the total number of major roads built from 1986 to 1989 to 3,365 kilometers; and feeder roads to 18,120 kilometers.
27,530 more hectares of farmlands were irrigated last year, benefi­ting 18,500 more farmers.
Nearly 7,000,000 more Filipinos gained access to safe drinking water with the implementation of 51,820 water supply projects.
From 2,042 barangays all over the country, among them the remot­est, 2,700,000 more Filipinos now enjoy power supply. Last year, we added 349 barangays to this number.
In all of our efforts to sustain the forces in our economy, we have emphasized the use of science and technology. At present, we are transferring technology from those who generate them to the end-users, especially in our rural areas.
Thus, we are supporting the widespread use of organic fertilizers in rice culture. This would save us some P241,000,000 yearly if used to replace half of present fertilizer imports. This type of fertilizer will increase farm income by as much as P3,000 per hectare every crop season.
We are also studying the potentials of locally developed technology using agro wastes, such as coconut husks, corn cobs, and coffee hulls, for brickmaking, grain drying, and power generation. This is called the gasifier-combustor. If one-fifth of these agro wastes replace the 4 million barrels of bunker fuel we now use for power generation, we could save about $70 million yearly.
Our advances in these areas received further boost from our accomplishments in the peace and order scene.
Last year, over 3,500 rebels, from both the communist and secessionist movements returned to the fold of the law. Another 2,500 surrendered during the first semester of this year.
Sixty-three ranking communist leaders were neutralized. Of this, 12 were top ranking national leaders of the CPP-NPA.
We have reduced the fighting strength of the CPP-NPA by 19% by the end of 1989. And we brought down the number of communist­-affected barangays by nearly 2,000, or 25% of the total number in 1988.
We registered last year a combat fatality ratio of one to two-and-a-half in favor of the government, the highest such favorable ratio in six years.
Inall parameters of our counterinsurgency effort, we are ahead. Also in the interest of peace and security, we continued to engage in diplomatic moves to formalize agreements and treaties protecting our interests. We undertook serious efforts to resolve territorial disputes. Our diplomatic missions have kept our lines open with the Organization of Islamic Conference countries. We have consistently used this access to apprise these countries of our accelerated implementation of autonomy for Muslim Mindanao.
And as the century of Pax Pacifica beckons, we continue to strengthen our foreign relations through our commitments to pluralist democracy, responsible market policies, and development diplomacy—all within the Constitutional provisions on national sovereignty, territorial integrity, national interest, the right to self-determination, and the commitment to international peace.
These gains would have been meaningless without advances in the area of justice. Here, we directed our efforts over the past 12 months at further improving the investigation and prosecution processes, and at providing our less privileged countrymen with much better access to our justice system.
We initiated the prosecution of civilians who took part in the failed December coup, which cases are now pending in our courts. We also prosecuted and secured the conviction of the accused in such celebrated cases as the murder of Secretary Jaime Ferrer; the murder of NAMFREL volunteers in Quirino; the murder of Fr. Carl Schmitz; and the attempted large-scale smuggling of firearms.
We adopted measures to expedite preliminary investigation of cases by shortening the period for appeal and strictly imposing the period within which cases must be resolved. We have also weeded out corrupt and inefficient prosecutors .
We relentlessly pursued drug syndicates and gambling lords and busted their operations.
We gave 184,208 indigents free legal aid.
And because of the need for suitable and dignified facilities for our judges and other officials in the justice system, we are constructing halls of justice in various parts of the country. Twenty-three of these will be ready for occupancy by the end of this month; 16 more will be completed by the end of the year.
We also advanced our quest for social justice as 340,000 more Filipino farmers were given ownership of the land they till, 85% more than the number in 1988.
In the process, we have distributed 13 times more land to former tenants under our Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program than was distributed from 1965 to 1985.
We also ensured that the lands they now own will become more productive through financial and technical support. Last year, we released P820,250,000 in production loans to farmer-beneficiaries.
This sum brings to P1,170,000 the total amount of production loans we have provided to 220,368 farmer-beneficiaries since I signed the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law passed by this Con­gress in 1988.
Our determination to implement our policy of decentralization found concrete expression when you and I began the process leading to the creation of two regional autonomous governments.
The first to undergo this process were provinces in southern Philip­pines where most of our Muslim brethren live. This vesting of political autonomy underscores your firm resolve and mine to continue enhancing the lives of Muslim Filipinos through their more meaningful participation in our nation’s political life.
On November 19 last year, our countrymen from this region cast their ballots, making their voice heard in the proposal to include their respective provinces in the proposed autonomous region. Sulu, Tawi­-Tawi, Lanao del Sur, and Maguindanao chose autonomy.
In this autonomous region, on February 17, 1990, over 600,000 voters went to the polling places once more; this time, to select from 126 candidates the occupants of 23 elective positions in the regional assembly. By the first week of this month, all the winners have been proclaimed, thus completing this chapter in their bid for regional autonomy.
The second to undergo this process was the Cordillera region. On January 30, 1990, the proposed Organic Act for the Autonomous Region of the Cordilleras was presented to the voters there. The province of Ifugao accepted membership in the autonomous region.
Political and material progress are, however, not the sole measures of democracy’s success. That is reckoned, as well, in the quality of a people’s spirit—in their attitude to the present and hope for the future.
Over the past months, in my continuing visits to the countryside, including the remotest and poorest provinces, I listened to our people and examined their lives. Having watched them so closely, I am encouraged by their resiliency and determination. Spurred by the support given them by government, they have set out to fashion for themselves a new and bright future. They are relying on their resourcefulness and industry and on one another to improve their lives.
Last year, I felt this resurgent spirit enkindled in the people of Bataan and Bohol, Cavite and Laguna. I saw this again among our countrymen in Negros Oriental, Zamboanga City, as well as Cotabato City.
This year, I saw this among the garments and livelihood cooperatives of Bulacan; and among the farmers of the people’s livelihood foundations of Pangasinan and Tarlac.
This is evident too among the people’s organizations of Catan­duanes, Pampanga, Romblon, Negros Occidental, North and South Cota­bato, Rizal, Iloilo, and Camarines Sur.
In many parts of our country, I saw a new determination among our people to work hand in hand with us, to link arms with us, in our effort to translate our democracy into a better life for our people.
As we, however, were making real headway in our socioeconomic thrusts, the enemies of our democracy, who comprised some 2% of the military, struck on December 1, 1989, in a futile bid to blunt the impact of the gains of our democracy.
For a few days, these misguided elements waged war against our people, employing a terrifying fear strategy that unmasked all their pretensions to ideological inclinations. Before our people, they attempted to display brute force, hoping to create an aura of armed victory. By December 6, the show was over. True to form, the leaders of the failed coup deserted their men once more to face the consequences of their act.
Once more, our people, and the 98% of our armed forces who remained loyal to our Constitution, thwarted the evil design of this band of military adventurists and their civilian supporters.
Once more, we proved that we are a resolute people. While we have yet to fully recover from the consequences of the imprudence of these misguided elements, our resolve to move forward has not been diminished. This failed adventurism has underscored the fact that our restored democracy has gone past its fledgling stage. It has proceeded to mature and is now ready for a more profound expression in our life as a nation.
I am truly encouraged by what our people have proved themselves capable of. They have worked hard with us to give substance to the meaning of participatory democracy, not just in the political arena, but in the realm of our nation’s social and economic life as well.
As President, I have deemed it fitting to enshrine in. a people’s movement the transformation of democracy from concept to reality by our countrymen.
Hindi ako binigo ng ating mga kababayan. Sa pagtawag ko sa sambayanan upang magkapit-bisig, tumugon ang mga kababayan nating tahimik na nagpapatulo ng pawis upang bumuti ang buhay ng kanilang pamilya, kapwa, at komunidad.
Ang mga Kabisig nating ito ang nagbigay-buhay sa diwa ng EDSA.
Sa lahat ng dako ng ating bansa ay taglay pa rin nila ang diwa ng rebolusyon ng 1986. Patuloy silang kumikilos laban sa kahirapan, kagu­luhan, sakit, at kamangmangan.
Katulong natin sila sa pagpapabilis at pagpapalaganap ng ating mga programa: sa repormang pansakahan; sa kapayapaan at kaayusan; sa pangangalaga ng ating kalikasan at likas na yaman; sa pagpapatupad ng desentralisasyon; at sa paghango natin sa mga kapus-palad nating kababayan mula sa kahirapan. Kasama natin sila sa pagtulong sa mga biktima ng nagdaang lindol sa Cabanatuan, Dagupan, Baguio, at iba pang mga pook.
Binigyang buhay ng mga Kabisig nating ito ang diwa ng ating Saligang Batas; binigyang halimbawa nila ang tunay na kahulugan ng demokrasya.
The magnitude of our people’s involvement in the business of our nation today is without precedent in our history.
All these find expression in a national movement—a movement that recognizes the silent, enduring crusade of our people; and, their call for participatory democracy.
We shall count on the strength of this partnership as we take the next steps in the building of a stronger nation.
Now, the Filipino people must continue to lead the way.
Many have benefited from the example of our previous struggles.
Many more stand to profit from what we shall make out of our democracy and freedom. We have proven many things during the past four years.
There is still much that has to be done. Despite the limited time left, we have our gains of four years to build on.
And from where I stand, I see that our nation is ready to take that giant step forward. Many of the needed reforms are in place. Our democracy is tried and tested. Our people are firm in their commitments.
We, in the elected leadership, must lead the way. We must demonstrate the willingness to pay the price, to accept the sacrifice that accompanies these decisions. Above all, we must show the supreme example of unity—unity born out of our shared aspirations for the common good.
May I now invite you to examine the challenges involved in this important step forward.
The Nation’s Agenda: Greater Productivity 
First, it is imperative that we take decisive steps to continue enhan­cing our nation’s productive capabilities.
We recognize the reality that the sufficiency of food on our tables is an important benchmark of the success of our democracy.
We took a crucial step when we launched our national rice action program early this year. Through this program, we expect to achieve a sustained annual growth rate in our production of at least 3% to 3.5% in rice, and at least 5% in corn.
We expect, however, that despite the massive resources and support we are giving our rice farmers, we will still experience a heavy toll on our harvest due to the prolonged dry season that we just experienced. Fortu­nately, our earlier gains in the agricultural sector will cushion the effect of this drought.
The productivity of our industrial sector was increased because of the peace that now characterizes much of labor-management relationship. Our renascent democracy has helped our workers appreciate more deeply the value of the peaceful resolution of conflicts. The number of strikes and lockouts have significantly decreased. In the process, P1 billion in workers’ salaries and benefits, and about P5.7 billion in production costs were saved.
We are supporting our drive for greater productivity with a stream­lined but responsive infrastructure program that placed special emphasis on our countryside. Of the total 6,297 kilometers of roads we constructed last year, 95% were built in the provinces. We have also placed emphasis on infrastructures that would support livelihood in our rural areas. Much of the productivity of our countryside rests on our speedy implementation of our Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. The selflessness of a mature people could provide this program with the much­ needed boost.
We also need to enhance productivity by more responsive programs on energy. We recognize the setbacks resulting from the power shortage we all experienced this year. While we have already instituted the remedies necessary to bring our power supply back to normal, we are determined to put in place the needed long-term power infrastructure that will assure our people a permanently stable supply of electricity.
These energy programs must be complemented by our efforts in the areas of telecommunications and transportation. The archipelagic nature of our geography calls for a safer, modern, and more efficient system of interisland water transportation.
We must remember that the highest priority in our quest for greater productivity are our disadvantaged countrymen. If we produce more, those who have less shall have more to partake of. This is the rationale for the many reforms we have implemented to tilt the balance in favor of the less privileged; to tilt the balance in favor of the countryside.
Preserving Our Natural Resources 
Our efforts at increased production must be complemented by our reinvigorated drive for conservation. I believe an important expression of our maturity is our exercise of good stewardship over our resources.
I am pleased to report that we marked a milestone last year in our reforestation program. In 1989, we reversed the deforestation trend: We have now planted more areas with trees than the areas wasted by the irresponsible exploitation of our forest resources.
Linking arms with our people and with nongovernmental organiza­tions, we have created a vision of development without destruction.
To underscore this commitment, I directed the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on June 1, 1990, to blast all roads leading to virgin forests being used by illegal loggers. Furthermore, we have drastically reduced the number of timber license agreements from 142 to 75.
The Population Issue 
Our maturity must now also be reflected in our stance on the population issue. I am aware that this is an emotionally charged subject matter that some of us have opted to shelve, or even totally ignore in the past.
We must now face this responsibility squarely and address it as a crucial health issue—a health issue where the well-being of our children, mothers, families—in fact, of our whole society, is at stake.
Here, we would like to give life to Article 15 of our Constitution which upholds the importance of our families, and the right of our children to proper care and nutrition.
At stake here, too, is the very application of the principles of our democracy: where our people make the choice; where the final judgment on the morality of their choices is left to the freedom of their conscience.
The Youth
The magnitude of the rebuilding work that is before us calls for the involvement of many more hands. There is thus a need for greater involvement among our youth, especially in activities where they are given the opportunities to appreciate the value of hard work, love for country, and a mature sense of responsibility.
In calling for this, we uphold the provisions of our Constitution. For we thereby underscore our recognition of the youth’s vital role in nation-­building.
For two years now, we have provided our youth with a vehicle for participation in public and civic affairs through the President’s Summer Youth Program. Over 71,000 young people took hands-on jobs in the countryside, in private sector offices, and in our government agencies. We exposed them to the realities of life while encouraging them to keep their idealism and advocacy for reforms.
And this month we called on them to march with us in our fight against drug abuse. They have responded well with the launching of the Junior Drug Watch.
I hope that in the coming years, there will be even more participation by them in these activities.
The Fiscal Issues
Our maturity is also anchored on a citizenry whose sense of patriot­ism is expressed in their honest and active participation in our revenue generation effort. This was evident last year as we increased our tax collection by 35.4%: from P90,400,000 in 1988 to P122,400,000 last year.
The more important expressions of our maturity, however, are the policy decisions we shall make as we adopt innovations in our revenue generation scheme: as we shift the tax burden from our poorer countrymen to the more affluent sectors of our society; as we enhance the equity and progressive character of our income tax measures; as we promote local autonomy through stronger local financing; as we continue to improve our tax administration.
We shall also undertake even more decisive steps towards lowering inflation and bringing down our fiscal deficits. In connection with this, we are intensifying our revenue generation efforts; we are accelerating the sale of government assets even as we take all the necessary measures to minimize public spending.
We will not stop until we bring down the public sector deficit to the more tolerable 3% as a ratio to our gross domestic product. We are determined to bring this ratio further down in the next two years.
Safeguarding Peace and Order 
We continue to strive to make compassion a genuine hallmark of our society. But as we take the path of maturity, we see the greater need to balance compassion with the strength of the arms of justice. Painful though it may be, we must look at the options for heavier penalties for plunder; for heinous crimes; for crimes against public order, including rebellion and attempts at seizing the powers of the State.
Our maturity is anchored, too, on the commitment of our soldiers to our Constitutional democracy. While there are still a few within the AFP who continue to hang the sword of Damocles over our people, I am proud to say that, on the whole, the AFP continues to be the protector of our democratic gains. Even as they perform their mandate of keeping peace and order in our land, they are also our partners in our development goals.
I cite in particular our AFP Engineering Corps, whose engineering brigades undertake the construction of several vital infrastructure, par­ticularly in the areas threatened by insurgency.
I am pleased to note that even in our peace and order efforts, the partnership approach is applied. The civilian sector continues to play a vital role in our integrated strategy towards the attainment of these goals. This partnership is evident in our various interagency councils, such as the peace and order, the regional development, and the national reconciliation and development councils.
Relations With Other Nations
Our maturity is anchored on our ability to earn and maintain a place of honor and respect in the community of nations.
We acknowledge the support of our friends in our economic deve­lopment thrusts. Last year, we obtained pledges and grants totaling $3,500,000, 98% of which have already been programmed or utilized for specific projects.
This place of honor also rests on our credibility before our interna­tional creditors. Today, we still suffer from the burdensome legacy of the past. Our foreign debt continues to stare us in the face; and so does the responsibility of servicing all of these debts.
Since the time we inherited these liabilities, you and I have not stopped looking for better repayment terms from our creditors. We have also pushed back the terms for the repayment of the principal. Where opportunities are present, we have taken advantage of them so as to buy back debts at significant and favorable discounts.
I share with you the concern that a significant amount of our country’s foreign exchange receipts flows out to service our foreign debt. I share with you the strong desire to see the day when our precious foreign exchange shall be used instead to fund social development.
It is also my hope, however, that Congress would share with me the concern that any move we take on the manner of debt repayment must never jeopardize in any way our painfully built good standing with our creditors.
The systematic approach we have adopted over the past four years has been beneficial to our people, to our constituents. This approach has favored our economic growth; price stability; and our renewed access to the international financial market.
Our economy today is one of the best performing among nations with substantial foreign debt. And this has been possible only because our creditors believe that they can count on our word and commitment. You and I must work together to keep it that way.
RP-US Relations
Finally, we must address the issue of our relationship with the United States of America.
We are determined to chart a new course in our relationship with our long-time ally. I served the notice of termination of our military bases agreement. I have made sure that the provisions of our Constitution have been strictly adhered to. Above all, I have painstakingly endeavored to ensure that the national interest will be upheld whatever the outcome of our future discussions with the United States.
I served that notice of termination knowing the far-reaching conse­quences of that act. I declared our preparedness to look into other possibili­ties in our relationship with America. I underscored our desire to keep the friendship, whatever form our partnership may take in the future.
In this historic event, there is a paramount issue to address. This is the question of our ability as a people to live out to the fullest the true essence of sovereignty.
We must ensure that in making the decision as to whether the bases must go or stay, we must unite instead of divide.
Should we become a nation divided after this decision, then there shall be no sovereignty to speak of. To follow our national will, whatever option we might take, we must first agree to rid ourselves of unhealthy division. Only then can we stand up to any foreign nation and say, “This is our people’s decision; we shall pursue it by every means.”
Proposals For Legislation 
When the two Houses of our Congress therefore meet in this Fourth Regular Session, there are two things I shall ask of you. First, I ask you to consider and appreciate the significance of this time in our history. I ask you to consider the options for a giant step forward that are arrayed before us.
And second, I ask you to address a legislative agenda that will push our democracy further into that level of maturity—a higher level of maturity necessary to the rebuilding of our nation. A good part of this agenda is drawn from initiatives already taken by the two Houses of Congress. In adopting this agenda, we focus on the commonality of our goals and our shared vision for our country and people.
I recognize as well that most of the bills in this agenda have been passed by one of the two Chambers and accordingly transmitted to the other. It is my hope and urgent call that this agenda we have worked out together will be completely enacted during this Fourth Regular Session.
May I now propose the following:
First, to help our countrymen in the disaster areas: the immediate passage of House Bill 31448 appropriating P10 billion for aid, relief, and rehabilitation, and for the repair and reconstruction of permanent structures affected by the recent earthquake.
Second, to further hasten our poverty alleviation and countryside agro-industrial development thrusts, the passage of the following mea­sures:
1. Providing small and medium enterprises with capital of less than P5,000,000 with an integrated assistance package and services, including more accessible credit and financing;
2. Strengthening the social amelioration program for the sugar in­dustry;
3. Establishing a Magna Carta for small farmers which seeks to further improve agricultural productivity and income; and
4. Providing for a code governing the development and conserva­tion of our fishery and aquatic resources.
Third, to further strengthen local autonomy: the immediate passage of the Local Government Code; particularly, the provisions rationalizing the allotment system to increase funds at the disposal of local government units.
Fourth, to further emphasize our concern for protection of the environment, the passage of the following bills:
1. Providing for comprehensive anti-pollution measures, includ­ing increased penalties for violations thereof;
2. Increasing charges for the cutting of timber and other forest products to levels that better reflect their economic value; and
3. Updating the 53-year old Public Land Law to conform to new realities.
Fifth, to enhance the equity and progressive character of our tax system, the passage of a tax reform package which includes, among others, the following bills:
1. Increase in personal exemptions from income tax;
2. Imposition of the affluent consumption tax;
3. Provision of ceilings on certain business deductions;
4. Conversion of the ad valorem tax on oil products to specific tax; and
5. Gradual phaseout of the gross receipts tax on banks to help cut intermediation cost.
Sixth, to underscore our sovereignty and independent foreign policy:
1. The passage of the law creating the Baselands Development Authority to implement the bases conversion plan which will be submitted by the Legislative-Executive Bases Council; and
2. The passage of a law upgrading our Foreign Service Corps. Seventh, to accelerate the upgrading of our transportation system:
a. The passage of a law increasing the capitalization of the Philip­pine National Railways; and
b. A law increasing the capitalization of the Light Rail Transit Authority.
And eighth, to strengthen the safeguards of our democracy, the passage of the following measures:
1. A revised bill repealing Presidential Decree 1850 thereby strengthening civilian supremacy over the military;
2. The anti-coup and the anti-plunder bills;
3. A bill providing for a witness protection program;
4. Omnibus amendments to the Dangerous Drugs Act; and
5. The passage of electoral reform measures.
Acknowledging the Work of Congress 
I join our people in thanking the ladies and gentlemen of both the Senate and the House of Representatives for the continuing legislative support you have given to our nation’s aspiration for greater productivity and reform.
I cite in particular your work on the following legislation of national importance: Republic Act No. 6810 or the Magna Carta for Countryside and Barangay Business Enterprises; Republic Act No. 6763 on the con­struction of concrete barangay roads and multipurpose pavements; Re­public Act No. 6849 on the installation of municipal public telephones; Republic Act No. 6826 on the grant of emergency powers to the president; and Republic Act No. 6948 upgrading the benefits of military veterans and their dependents.
I also acknowledge your help in the passage of the following laws:
Republic Act No. 6846 creating the Abot-Kaya Pabahay Fund; Republic Act Nos. 6938 and 6939 on the Cooperative Code and the Cooperative Development Authority; Republic Act No. 6952 establishing the Petro­leum Price Standby Fund; Republic Act No. 6956 modifying the excise tax on certain products; and Republic Act No. 6957 on the financing of infrastructure projects by the private sector.
I look forward to our continuing cooperation as we endeavor to keep the agenda of our nation foremost in our list of priorities.
As President, I reiterate my commitment to institute greater reforms during the next two years of this Presidency. I am aware of the many obstacles strewn in our path by those who wish to waylay our march towards our goals. I wish to assure you and the rest of our countrymen that I shall never be intimidated; there shall be no rest from my work until the task is completed.
But our success would not be possible without unity among us. I therefore ask you, Honorable Senators and Representatives of this our people’s Congress, and the rest of our leaders, to renew with me our commitment to the dream that bound us together in 1986: democracy, freedom, sovereignty, economic growth, social justice.
Let us join hands with our people as we undertake the task of rebuilding, and as we resume our march towards our goals.
I should like to thank all our friends throughout the world—govern­ments, institutions, as well as individuals—for the humanitarian assist­ance given to our people and the victims of the earthquake.
I intend to properly thank and commend them, along with all those who acted valiantly to save lives, at appropriate ceremonies in the near future.
The National Disaster Coordinating Council is hereby directed to submit to me at the soonest possible time the full list of these friends and these heroes.
May katiyakan ang ating tagumpay kung tayo’y magkakaisa. Kung kaya’t hinihimok ko kayo—kagalang-galang na mga Senador, Kongresista, at ang iba pang mga pinuno ng bayan—na muli tayong manumpa sa pangarap na nagbigkis sa atin noong 1986: ibalik at panatiliin ang demokrasya, kalayaan, karapatan, katatagang pangkabuhayan, at katarungang panlipunan.
Mula sa halos ganap na pagkawasak na ating naranasan, tayong lahat ay magkapit-bisig upang magampanan natin ang ating tungkulin na itayong muli ang napinsala sa atin, nang sa gayon ay makapagpatuloy tayo sa landas tungo sa ating inaasam na mga layunin.
Magkaisa tayo. Magtulungan tayo. Maraming salamat po.

TRANSCRIPT:
The State of the Nation Message of Her Excellency Corazon C. Aquino President of the Philippines To the Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 22, 1991]
Senate President Jovito Salonga; Speaker Ramon Mitra; Chief Justice Marcelo Fernan; Honorable Diosdado Macapagal; distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; fellow workers in government; honored guests; minamahal kong mga kababayan:
In March 1973, six months after the declaration of martial law, Ninoy Aquino was taken blindfolded from Fort Bonifacio and brought to a place he did not know. He was stripped naked and thrown into a cell. His only human contact was a jailer. The immediate prospect, in such a place, was a midnight execution in front of a grave dug by himself.
The purpose was as clear as it was diabolical. It was not to kill him yet, but to break him first – and with him break the compelling proof that men can stand up to a dictatorship.
He came close to giving up, he told me; he slipped in and out of despair. But a power that must have been God held him together. He remembered the words of the epistle, God chose the weak to confound the strong.
On the third anniversary of his incarceration in Laur, the recol­lection of his pain gave birth to a poem of hope. This is the poem he wrote:
I am burning the candle of my
life in the dark
with no one to benefit
from the light.
The candle slowly melts away;
soon its wick will be burned
out
and the light is gone.
If someone will only gather
the melted wax, re-shape it,
give it a new wick—
for another fleeting moment
my candle can once again
light the dark,
be of service
one more time,
and then … goodbye.
This is the anguish of good men: that the good they do will come to nothing. That pains suffered in obscurity or sacrifices made away from the sight of men, amount to the same, and mock the man or woman who bears them.
Mr. Senate President, Mr. Speaker, members of the Congress, distinguished guests, my countrymen:
That is not true. None of the good that we do is ever lost; not even the light in an empty room is wasted.
From Ninoy’s burnt-out candle, and thousands like it in cells throughout the garrison state, we gathered the melted wax and made more candles. To burn—not as long in such loneliness—but much more brightly all together, as to banish the darkness, and light us to a new day.
You might ask, “When will the president stop invoking Ninoy’s name?” My answer is, “When a president stands here other than by Ninoy’s grace. And not while gratitude is nourished by memory. Not while we acknowledge that it was his sacrifice that gave us back our freedom. And restored the freely elected office whose incumbent must stand every year in this place.”
Five years have passed. My term is ending. And so is yours. As we came, so should we go. With grateful acknowledgement to the man who made it possible for us to be here. A man who discovered hope in the starkest despair, and has something yet to teach a country facing adversity again.
It would be foolish to ignore what is staring us in the face. Our march of progress brought us far, but such misfortunes have come upon us as to make us feel that we are not much farther from where we started.
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo is the biggest in this century. Abroad, its effect is so far-reaching as to lower the temperature of the Earth. At home, it is so devastating it knocked off 80,000 productive hectares from our agriculture, and destroyed the commerce of at least three provinces. Hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes and livelihoods, and thrown on the kindness of relatives and countrymen, and on the solicitude of the state. It was an event so powerful it wiped out the largest military base in the Pacific, and changed the nature of our relationship with an old ally. In the wake of the volcanic eruption, more has been revealed about that relationship than was covered by its ash.
Before Pinatubo, there was the typhoon that cut a wide swathe of destruction across the southern regions. And before that was the killer quake that cut off the northern parts of the country, destroying billions of pesos in infrastructure, causing the loss of billions more in foregone economic activities. It leveled the City of Pines and buried children in the rubble of yet another city.
But those natural calamities were preceded by another entirely the work of human hands: the massive December 1989 military revolt that cut short a second economic recovery, after the dislocation caused by the earlier August 1987 coup attempt. That one strangled the powerful rebound of the Philippine economy after the EDSA Revolution.
I mention these calamities not to excuse the perceived shortcomings of my administration nor to brag about my indestructibility. I mention them so that we know where we are, and why we are here, and the exact requirements of the task to build up this country yet again.
I mention them because I will compare them with what we had and lost, and then I will ask, “Was it all in vain?” And I will answer, “It was not; no more than a hero’s life is wasted.”
By 1985, the economy had contracted considerably, its rate of growth has been negative for two consecutive years. The country was at a standstill, as if waiting only for the last rites to be performed. By 1986, we had turned the economy around—in less than a year. We improved on that performance the year after.
The rate of unemployment was reduced, the volume of new investments significantly increased. New industrial projects were introduced, hitherto idle industrial capacity was fully utilized. The foundation of new regional industrial zones was laid. Public infrastruc­ture and services strained under the load of expanding economic activity.
I mention this, not to offset the shortcomings of the present with the achievements of the past. I mention it to show what can be done in such a short time, and how much improvement was made from condi­tions far worse than what we have today—the dictator’s apologists notwithstanding, that the country is worse off now than when he and his wife were stealing the country blind.
This progress was cut off by the August ’87 coup attempt. But the economy quickly rallied, and in two years recovered a great deal of the ground we had lost. We were on the verge of a second takeoff when the December 1989 coup broke out. It drained the last drop of confidence in our future from all but the hardiest spirits, and shat­tered our image abroad.
Still we persevered, achieving gains that, admittedly, continue to fall short of the galloping needs of a fast-growing population, but real gains nonetheless.
Improved health care, increased housing, and—one of the proudest achievements we share with the legislature—free secondary education: 660,000 youth immediately availed themselves of it; another 200,000 private school students received scholarship grants under another recent law; 80,000 new classrooms have been built—the first preparation of the nation for the future of economic competition, which will take place in the highly educated minds of the youth.
We have made the first serious effort to arrest environmental degradation—already so far advanced in the previous regime that it set up an agency that did nothing about it, anyway. We have pushed agrarian reform beyond the point of no return, almost completing its coverage of rice and corn. Its extension to other agricultural activities is proceeding at a pace consistent with our resolve to achieve for the farmer the prosperity promised by agrarian reform, and not just its bare legal implementation.
Indeed, we started to make up our losses, and kept on going through the Gulf crisis which doubled the price of energy and introduced the element of a tremendous uncertainty, not only about our economy, but that of the world as well.
You might ask, “Having lost so much so easily, what was the worth of all that effort?”
With such reversals of fortune, is progress for our country a hope in vain?
Paul says that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance character; and character hope. The good we do is never lost. Some of it remains, if not in material goods, then in a deeper experience, a more practiced hand, and a spirit made stronger by that which failed to break it—stronger to meet greater challenges ahead.
But in one thing we grew from strength to strength—in the enlargement of our democratic space and the strengthening of our democracy.
Every calamity tested the capacity of democracy to absorb distress, find relief, and meet the absolute necessities of the people without the least curtailment of freedom or compromise of rights.
Against our economic gains that are ever hostages to fortune, stands one steadfast, unalloyed achievement: our democracy. Destined, I believe, to outlive our problems and deck with the graces of liberty the material progress of our future. That achievement is better seen from the disinterested distance of foreign admirers, than from the myopic view of those at home who wish to destroy it. [Applause] It is an achievement entirely in our power to preserve and enhance.
Visitors from the new Germany asked me what things strengthen democracy. Economic progress, naturally, I said. But the attainment of that depends on external factors more than on the will of a developing country. But there is a way to strengthen democracy that is within any country’s reach. That is through the empowerment of the people. This is obvious to a government like ours that came to power by its means, as well as to a people like the Germans who attained complete freedom in the same way.
But empowering the people means more than just giving them elections every three years. It means enlarging their contact with government beyond elections to its daily workings—so that the vast resources of one support the initiatives of the other, and the policies of government are refined by the insights of the people. Ngunit ang pagkaloob ng kapangyarihan sa mamamayan ay nanganga­hulugan hindi lamang ng pagdaraos ng halalan tuwing ikatlong taon. Kailangan pagyamanin ang kanilang pagkakadiit sa pamahalaan—sa araw-araw na gawain ng pamahalaan—upang ang malawak na kayamanan ng isa ay makatulong sa mga pagkukusa ng kabila at ang mga patakaran ng pamahalaan ay paglinangin ng mga mamamayan. By this means the lives of the people shall be con­stantly improved and the people themselves empowered by the habit of directing their own government. The constant revision of flawed policies and the wider application of good ones are possible only by bringing together the people and the government. People empowerment, through people’s organizations, NGOs, foundations, and cooperatives, is the surest means we know to make government mirror the aspirations of the people. [Applause]
In the past, the idea was to give the people just enough power to elect their mistakes and suffer the consequences until the next elections. Elections were a safety valve. We want elections to be just one of other more effective means to bring the people into government and government to the people, to make it truly a participatory democracy.
This is the only way to end the character of total war that elections have assumed, where the aim is the division of spoils and the victims are not just the losers but those who voted for them too. Such elections are like Russian roulette where your chances are five to one your life will not improve, and one to five you will blow out your brains.
Participatory democracy will end the practice of punishing provinces and municipalities for the wrong vote in the last poll. It will separate elections, where the people vote for their favorites, from the provision of public service which every Filipino has a right to expect from the government, regardless how he voted.
This administration has made large steps in that direction. To the disappointment of those who marched with me against the Marcos regime, my administration has plowed resources into regions and provinces where I was cheated in the snap elections. The politics of revenge had had its day. [Applause]
The organized participation of the people in daily government may provide the stabilizing element that government has always lacked. Policies have radically changed with each administration, yet the basic needs of its unchanging constituencies have not been met: less bureaucracy for business, more public services and infrastructure support for agriculture and industry, and economic safety net for the common man. The active participation of the people in government will lend proper direction and continuity to policy.
This is what I wish for most. That after me, the continuity of our work is not broken. So that things well done shall be completed, and the same mistakes avoided by succeeding administrations. In this way, nothing done shall go to waste, and the light of a misplaced candle shall still be valued for the light it sheds on the things to avoid.
I am not asking that all my programs be blindly followed by my successor. God knows, we have made mistakes. But surely, our objective is right—the improvement of our people’s lives. And the new way is much better than those before. To give the people greater power over their lives is the essence of democracy that we must strive to bring out completely.
These ideas, articulated in the Kabisig movement, may not have been well received by this body. It was wrongly projected. I should make it clear that the Kabisig, and the whole movement of people’s organizations that I have tried to encourage, will be campaigning hard for one candidate only—the Filipino people and no one else. [Applause]
Give the people power movement another chance, for it will go on regardless. I ask you to consider that we have tried the politics of spoils and patronage for half a century, with no better result than the stagnation of the country in a region where everyone else is racing ahead.
The formula for success is said to be dictatorial government.
But we tried that already, with worse results than the most irresponsible democracy can produce. Besides, the spirit of our race will not accept a dictatorship; and memories, fresh as the scars it left, will not let us consider that option again. Democracy is the only way for us. We must therefore find the ways by which the pitfalls that go with its blessings are reduced, while its inherent strengths are brought to the fore. Of those strengths, the most promising is people power, a reserve for nation-building we tapped only once in our history with such marvelous result.
A detailed report of the performance of government is before you; the legislative agenda—principally the Local Government Code, the Civil Service Code, revenue enhancement measures, and electoral reforms—has been communicated to the Senate President and to the Speaker of the House.
This is the last time I shall address you on such an occasion as this. Let us clear the air between us.
I could have made things easier for myself if I had opted for the “popular.”
I could have repudiated the foreign debt, won the passing praise of a greatly relieved people, and the lasting contempt of a devastated country.
I could have opted for outright hostility towards the international banking system and invited its retaliation. But the only result would have been to weaken the present democracy against the conspiracies of the former government which contracted the miserable debt in the first place. I would have taken the chance, if I were the only one at risk, but I had a country to take care of. [Applause]
I could have called for an elected constitutional convention.
Surveys showed that an elected convention was the popular choice to draft a new constitution. But I believed it was more important to draft a constitution and submit it for ratification in the shortest time possible, and hold elections immediately. The people and the army needed a full elected government and a constitution around which to rally in defense of freedom.
I could not afford the luxury of the popular by waiting out the endless deliberations of an elected convention, like the 1971 Constitutional Convention. And besides, what was so great about that experience? After a year of talk and scandal, the final draft was prepared in Malacañang, approved by the frightened convention, and ratified in a fraudulent plebiscite.
I could have made things easier for myself if I had allowed the executive to influence the decisions of constitutional commissions. I might have spared myself deep embarrassments by interfering with the judgments of the courts. But I uphold the independence of these bodies. I am convinced it is in all our best interest to respect an independence that may thwart the government’s will from time to time—but is yet our best assurance of justice when we will need justice most. [Applause]
I firmly believe in the freedom of the press. And I accept the criticisms poured on me, painful as they are, as part and parcel of the hazards of public service, and conducive to its honest performance. True, I have sued for libel, but I did not use the power of the presidency to advance my cause. And this is shown by the fact that four years later my case continues to drag on. [Applause] I have not forgotten that what my husband wanted most in prison was for the public to hear the side of freedom, and no newspaper would print it.
I submitted myself to the judicial process as an ordinary citizen, and exposed myself to indignities a president should not endure. But I want to encourage people to seek redress in the law, despite the inconvenience, rather than in vindictiveness, which has no end. I want them to make the cause of justice for one, the cause of justice for all. [Applause]
I have consoled myself that great men like Gandhi were not spared criticism either, but—regardless of it—he pursued the path he believed was true, mindful only of harmful effects on the people, but not of the consequences to him. He believed that God demands no less of us than that we follow our conscience. God will take care of the rest.
I could have done the popular thing in the last admi­nistration, and arranged a nicer retirement for myself. But my instructions to PNB, DBP, GSIS, SSS, and Land Bank were explicit: no behest loans, and no special favors [applause] whether to relative, friend, or political supporter. This accounts for their sterling performance, for the unprecedented public faith in their competence and integrity, and for the incalculable contribution, particularly of PNB and the Land Bank, to the development of cooperatives and the financing of small and medium enterprises, wherein lies the strongest hope of progress in these times.
We can roll back prices at the drop of a hat and spare ourselves all the aggravation, but we learned that hasty rollbacks exacted a heavier, long-term cost on the economy, and, ultimately, on the people, than they had saved.
I could have done any of the things calculated to win a passing popularity at home. I could have thrown away by so-called popular solutions the goodwill we have built up in financial circles by the strict performance of our obligations. This is the goodwill that accounts for the continued support extended to the Philippine Assistance Program [PAP]. Anyway, most of the pledges to the PAP are redeemable in the next administration.
I could have said, “Let my successor be presented with the bill for my popularity today.” But it is the people who would pay the price, and I am not made that way. [Applause]
I did not always adopt the ideal solutions proposed by those who have the luxury of contemplation. Government often had to do what pressing realities compelled it. And if the government sometimes lacked better choices, it never lacked the sincere desire to do good. [Applause]
I could have promoted only military officers popular with the press, and ignored the experience of a democratic government that has been the principal military objective of the rebel forces and an insurgency that just doesn’t know when to quit. But I chose instead commanders of proven courage, leadership, and fidelity to the Constitution.
I could do the smart thing still, and do the things my opponents unfairly charge me of preparing—rigging the elections in 1992, the way I did not rig the ratification of the Constitution, the national elections, and the local elections. The way they rigged elections from 1969 to 1986. But my instructions to the military and police are explicit. Let them hear it again:
The right of the soldier and the policeman is merely to cast his vote; his greater and solemn obligation is to assure the right of others to cast their votes and get them honestly counted. [Applause] No soldier has the right to combine with his comrades to campaign for a person or party and deliver to them a block of the military vote. No member of the military shall lend his name, prestige, and the influence of his position to anyone’s campaign. The same holds true for the police. [Applause]
The military has earned the people’s trust as the spearhead of their liberation and the constant defender of their democracy. To these honors, it is my aim to add the distinction of shepherding our democracy through its first political succession, by clean and peaceful elections. [Applause]
I will not preside as Commander in Chief over the kind of military that cheated the opposition in 1978, and me in 1986. [Applause] That would insult the memory of the man to whom I dedicate this last address to the joint houses of Congress, and stain the proud achievement of this nation in 1986.
I specifically charge AFP Chief of Staff General Lisandro Abadia and PNP Director General Cesar Nazareno with the responsibility to assure clean and honest elections. [Applause] While they may not fear my displeasure because I will not be president then, they will face the judgment of the disappointed country.
Yes, I could have done all those things that win wide acclaim, exiting as grandly as any president could wish. But while my power as president ends in 1992, my responsibility as a Filipino for the well-being of my country goes beyond it to my grave. [Applause] A great part of that responsibility is to do the best I can today, according to my best lights, while I have the power to do it.
As President, I have never prayed for anything for myself; only for our people. I have been called an international beggar by the military rebels. Begging does not become me, yet— perhaps it is what I had to do. I could have kept my pride and held aloof, but that would not have helped our people. And it is for them that I was placed in this office. [Applause]
Someone who will do better may stand in this place next year, for I believe in the inexhaustible giftedness of the Filipino people. I only hope that he will be someone who will sincerely mean you well. [Applause]
I hope that history will judge me as favorably as our people still regard me, because, as God is my witness, I honestly did the best I could. No more can be asked of any man. [Applause]
On June 30, 1992, the traditional ceremony of political succession will unfold at the Luneta. The last time it was done that way was in 1965. I shall be there with you to proudly witness the event. This is the glory of democracy, that its most solemn moment should be the peaceful transfer of power. [Applause]
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat at paalam. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

MessageofHis Excellency Fidel V. RamosPresident of the PhilippinesTo the CongressOn the State of the Nation
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 27, 1992]
“Reform, Change and Growth” 
Mr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; Vice President Joseph Estrada; Chief Justice Andres Narvasa; the distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; Your Excellencies of the Diplomatic Corps; honored guests; fellow workers in government.
This afternoon my traffic escorts saw to it that the delay, because of bad weather, floods on the streets was exactly for one hour in order not to disrupt the schedule of the Joint Session of Congress.
Today we begin our joint and complementary efforts to discharge government’s sworn duty to our people and our country.
Ordinarily, this occasion has for its time frame the year just past and the year unfolding.
But for us, this gathering has a more transcendent meaning. For it also begins our terms of office. And that cannot but enlarge our horizon as we survey the state of the nation.
I stand here to ask for the support of Congress and to offer my hand in a partnership of patriotism and progress between the executive and the legislative. Our Constitution specifies separate powers and responsibilities for Congress and the presidency—as distinct and coequal branches of government. Yet our Charter also reminds us we are not rivals for power, but partners in serving the national interest.
Though there are tasks that only the executive or the legislature must carry out, we are both trustees of a common heritage, a common interest, and a common purpose.
We stand on the threshold of destiny. The end of my term will coincide with the centennial of our declaration of independence. Six years hence, the governments this nation has endured will pass in review and receive the judgment of history. They will be asked what they will do, what they did with the country’s independence. My administration will be the last before the centennial. That is my luck, for it will naturally receive the closest scrutiny. It is not only the spirit of independence that will demand a reckoning. In the next six years, the nation will commemorate other great centennials: the Cry of Pugad Lawin, the Battle of Pinaglabanan, the execution of Rizal. One hundred years of sacrifice and struggle. The ghosts of a generation of founding heroes shall step from their monuments to demand an accounting of the legacy they left behind.
In this spirit, I come here today to report to you on the state of the nation; and to tell you of the course I propose we follow in meeting our shared responsibility.
Twenty-eight days ago, I entered into the presidency. Since then, my principal object has been to know all that one can possibly know—in that brief time—of the problems facing the nation, the opportunities open to us, and the support we can count on from our people and from our friends in the world. I shall not pretend that my administration now knows all the answers. Nor that we now have all the requisites to meet every problem and every contingency. But this much is clear to me: Though our problems are grave, we are much better placed to address them than our predecessors were, a year or so ago.
Though obstacles may shadow our labors, we have the crucial requisite for surmounting them: and that is the combined resolve of our people and their elected representatives to join together and face all problems and all dangers.
I see our task not in terms of any specific problem but in the light of the purposes of union enshrined in the Preamble to our Constitution:
To build a just and humane society and establish a government that shall embody our ideals and aspirations, promote the common good, conserve and develop our patrimony, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of independence and democracy under the rule of law and a regime of truth, justice, freedom, love, equality and peace.
Some of these hopes have attained a measure of fulfillment under the past administration and the last Congress.
Certainly we are today a nation confirmed in our constitutional democracy: strengthened by the trials we have weathered.
Considerable stability has been attained in the economy—as efforts at stabilization, restructuring, and reform over the last six years have borne fruit.
But our people still live under the weight of many problems. The indicators of national life tell us just how heavy is this burden: The top 20% of Filipino families receives 50% of our country’s total household income; the lowest 20% receives only 5%. At least 5.8 million families—over half of all our households—do not earn enough to meet their basic needs.
In 1991, some 2.3 million of our workers were jobless; and 7.6 million of those who had jobs were working less than 40 hours a week.
Meanwhile, 860,000 young people join the labor force every year.
These severities of economic life translate into grave problems in politics and social life.
Today we are one of a few countries burdened with the combined weight of communist insurgency and other rebellions.
Crime makes our streets unsafe, and threatens our citizens in their homes.
Social services have lagged behind the rise of population and the mass migration to our cities of poor rural people. Neighborhoods are deteriorating and too many families are without adequate housing. Our education and health services are under unbearable strain.
And every day that we delay meeting these problems, they grow more intractable.
The test is whether we can act with dispatch to answer these challenges—not tomorrow but today.
Peace and security are the first urgent problem. For as long as instability and uncertainty characterize our common life, we shall not make any headway. This is why in my inaugural address I immediately raised the issue of amnesty to enable rebels to reenter civil society as law-abiding citizens.
Our goal must be to attain a just, comprehensive, peaceful, and lasting resolution of the internal armed conflict that has cost the nation and our people so dearly.
This effort must go hand in hand with the thrust of my government to institute basic reforms to root out the causes of rebellion.
After lengthy consultations within the government and the private sector, I am now prepared to take the following steps.
First, I am submitting to Congress today an amnesty proclamation that will cover some 4,500 former rebels—2,100 former members of the CPP-NPA and 2,400 former members of the MNLF—who have already applied for amnesty under Executive Order No. 350, promulgated on March 13, 1989, as well as those who may still wish to apply for amnesty under this Executive Order. I ask for immediate Congressional concurrence.
This grant of amnesty is the initial step in a comprehensive peace and unification process that shall address the problem of bringing back all other rebels to the fold of the law. I therefore invite both chambers of Congress to join the executive in constituting a National Unification Commission, that will include representatives of the private sector. This commission will undertake extensive consultations with concerned sectors of society, including rebel groups, in order to formulate a viable amnesty program and the process that will lead to a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace.
And before i proceed any further let me sign in your presence my Letter of Transmittal of Proclamation No. 10 to the Honorable Senate President and to the Honorable Speaker of the House as follows:
I transmit herewith Proclamation no. 10 titled “Granting amnesty in favor of persons who have filed or will file application for amnesty under EO no. 350 Series of 1989 for your concurrence pursuant to Sec. 19, Article no. 7 of the Constitution.
The committee must submit its findings and recommendations within 90 days.
I have also directed the Secretaries of Justice, Defense, and Interior and Local Government to review the cases of so-called rebels under detention or serving sentence and to recommend as soon as possible who can be released through administrative action, granted executive clemency, or recommended for release under bail, with the end in view of further creating a favorable climate for national unity.
Finally, I ask Congress to repeal Republic Act No. 1700, as amended, so that the Communist Party of the Philippines and similar organizations will no longer be outlawed but allowed to compete freely, openly, and peacefully in the political, economic, and social arena instead of their following the path of the armed struggle.
Peace is a process. And we must all join hands to bind and heal the conflicts that have so long divided and held us back.
Crime is the other problem that endangers our peace.
When public order breaks down; when men, women and children fear for their safety in the streets and in their homes; when contempt and mistrust characterize citizens’ attitudes toward lawful authority; then we all—young and old, rich, and poor—are victimized.
These past 28 days show what we can do once the will is there. The creation of the Presidential Anti-Crime Commission is only the beginning. More is required to eradicate this plague in our society.
First, I ask congress to restore the death penalty to cover heinous crimes, which of late have enjoyed a resurgence—encouraged, no doubt, by the weakness of our deterrents.
Second, let us deal decisively with the scalawags in uniform by doubling the penalties for law enforcers and military personnel who commit criminal acts. And let us in the same measure provide incentives and rewards for public servants in uniform who show dedication and skill.
I saw many of them out in the flooded streets of Quezon City and Manila as I was coming here this afternoon.
Third, let us improve our institutional and professional capability for crime prevention and crime suspension at both national and local levels. These measures should include a stricter firearms control law and more effective actions by our peace and order councils.
In the economy, let us move forward from stabilization and restructuring to measures and policies designed for growth. One step above all is essential: the formulation of a national midterm development plan for the six years from 1993 to 1998. In the framing of this plan, I invite the participation of Congress; and this can be facilitated by the speedy creation of a Legislative-Executive Development Council, which I recommend to you.
I shall soon submit to Congress the proposed national budget for fiscal year 1993.
Through the budget, we shall pump-prime the economy; stimulate growth by focusing public investments on programs with the highest productive and economic returns; and provide social services and productivity programs that will empower the majority among us who are now without the means to lead decent and useful lives, particularly the farming, fishing, and labor sectors.
Infrastructure building we must push aggressively. This will not only create jobs in the countryside. It will also give investors proof of our resolve to provide growth a solid foundation for sustainable development.
Our priorities are communications, arterial highways, local and national roads, major bridges, urban highways, and major water conservation and flood control projects.
For efficiency and continuity, all these should be provided multiyear funding. We shall also tap private resources under the build-operate-transfer and similar schemes. To liberalize the private sector’s entry into the transport industry, it will be necessary to amend the 50-year old public service law.
To finance this infrastructure program, we shall be unrelenting in collecting what is due the government in taxes, duties, and other revenues. This can be attained primarily by cracking down on tax evaders. Tax evasion can be curbed if we can show that tax evaders—whoever they may be—will not go undetected and unpunished.
But let me also tell you now that we cannot make do with our present revenue base. Development has a price that must be paid.
And we shall submit to you a set of revenue proposals that will enable us to pay this price equitably.
On debt management, we are adopting a growth-oriented strategy, to contain our obligatory burden of debt servicing.
I assure you we shall also be much more assertive in negotiating with our creditors to gain better terms.
Some members of Congress have expressed anxiety about my decision to sign the new restructuring agreement that the past administration had reached with private creditors. But let me tell you that to forego this agreement would have meant stalling our forward movement and going back to square one—without any assurance that we can renegotiate let alone get better terms.
To maintain economic stability, we need continued fiscal and monetary discipline. We intend to keep the budget deficit within manageable and acceptable levels.
By adhering to this austere monetary program, we should be able to keep down inflation to a single digit throughout the rest of the year and beyond.
Alongside the monetary program, we need to improve the fiscal position of the Central Bank.
These measures will set the stage for strengthening the financial system—and bring down the regime of high interest rates. We should then be able to mobilize development financing for both agriculture and industry—not just through government financial institutions but primarily through the private banking system, whose business that ought to be.
In energy, we have moved with speed to moderate the crisis. But a new Department of Energy is still imperative—to make sure our experience of long brownouts during the past several months is never repeated and our long-term energy needs are met.
This new department will plan, implement, coordinate, and supervise all policies and programs on energy. The law we propose will also establish an energy development fund to be sourced from the Oil Price Stabilization Fund.
In trade, we expect a rise in export demand as our major markets return to growth. You can count on the executive to do all we can to make our industries worldwide competitive.
This means gradually abolishing all remaining quantitative restrictions on trade, liberalizing the foreign exchange market, and adopting a more realistic foreign exchange rate.
In support of the Foreign Investments Act, I ask Congress to amend the Condominium Law and liberalize nationality requirements in the Omnibus Investment Code. The objective is to make foreign companies secure in the possession of their plant sites in industrial estates.
We shall also review the present system of incentives to make it more attractive and encourage the flow of investments into the economy.
All our policies for growth will have a deep concern for protecting our environment. Our natural surroundings must be the beneficiary of modernization, not its victim.
I urge this Congress to take up anew the ban on logging which should, however, consider the possibility of identifying the areas where logging can be permitted under the concept of sustainable development.
I am also submitting for your urgent action an Environment Protection Code and a new Forestry Code to institutionalize the control by local communities over forests within their territories.
These measures will in time move the economy back to growth. But let us not imagine that growth by itself will suffice to bring the poor majority of our countrymen and communities into the mainstream of development.
If we are to substantially reduce poverty in the Philippines, economic policy in the large must become sensitive to the well-being of the majority among us who are without the means to enjoy decent and useful lives.
Within the week, I will sign an Executive Order creating a President’s Commission to fight poverty, which shall gather under one umbrella all government activities designed to help our poor households and communities so that they catch up with the more progressive ones.
We shall undertake three main types of intervention against poverty: The first is to ensure the delivery of basic social services to the poorest communities and to make sure that every poor family has a decent minimum of health, nutrition, housing, and education. The second is to see to it that the poor gain access to agrarian reform, skills training, and extension services that will open up livelihood opportunities and jobs to them. And the third is to help poor communities organize cooperatively to empower them to play a greater role in their own development and to make their voices heard in the making of public policy.
We must, in sum, depart from the “trickle-down” policies of the past, which had only left our poor farmer and other communities farther behind, and move into a policy of “positive discrimination” to lift them up and equip them with the humanities of life. Government will set itself not just theoretical but measurable standards for gauging its success in easing poverty year after year.
To act in this way for our poor is to assert the timeless principle that if we are to develop, we must invest in people. For our nation can rise only to the level of our people’s competence. The most profitable human investment is in basic education. I urge Congress to pass a bill on elementary education for the purpose of insuring universal and higher quality elementary education to the end that every Filipino child has access to a quality public elementary school. It will also ensure exposure of our young to technical and scientific knowledge. There are still thousands of barangays today that do not have elementary schools. In addition, we must upgrade the quality of instruction, textbooks, and school facilities. In sum, we must give the highest priority to elementary education in our spending program. To stress this is not to ignore the requirements of public secondary and higher education. These also merit our attention. But we must recognize that to bring our educational system into the mainstream of national renewal, we must begin at the beginning by making sure that every Filipino child has an elementary school within easy reach and that our young people are exposed to technical and scientific learning. We have to learn to talk of growth not in terms of statistics, but in terms of people: in the child we save from hunger and raise to knowledge, in the citizen we raise to a life of dignity and well-being, in the woman we raise to her true place in our society, in the community that we transform from distress into a net contributor to national vitality, and in a national culture that truly reflects and appreciates the native talent and resourcefulness of the Filipino. It has become a cliche, but it is nonetheless true: Real development has a human face.
We have missed perhaps this human dimension in our labors because government has become too big and has spread itself too thin. Over the last 28 days, one thing has become plain to me. For us to get anywhere, we need to remodel the very machinery of government. We have to reorganize the civil service so that it can do more—and do better. We must rationalize the public corporate sector by privatizing those of its operations which are better undertaken by private enterprise. And we must devolve and decentralize more of national administration so that government truly reaches out to our citizenry, wherever they may live in our vast archipelago.
This effort can be propelled only by definitive support from Congress. Since the reorganization will affect most of the cabinet departments, it does not make sense for us to reorganize piecemeal.
I would urge Congress therefore to consider one comprehensive “Government Reorganization Act” that will enable us to streamline the entire executive branch, including the Office of the President.
Our goal here is to promote speed in decision making and action that yields quality results; and to increase effectiveness and impact in government operations despite funding constraints.
We envision the following as integral parts of this reorganization program: (1) implementation of the law on attrition; (2) realignment of agency mandates by abolishing nonessential functions including vacant positions; (3) integration of all attaches and offices abroad; and (4) reduction of the number of departments and agencies.
Some have mistakenly thought that this is a request for blanket authority for the president in reorganization. What we seek is a law that will fully enable us to reorganize the executive branch. Others fear that reorganization will result in massive layoffs. This is not envisioned at all. The only ones who have to fear displacement are 15 to 30 employees and all those who do not possess civil service eligibilities.
Reorganization and professionalization of the civil service will greatly strengthen our hand in checking graft. But we shall not rely only on these reforms, nor on the independent work of the ombudsman and the Sandiganbayan.
As I proposed in my inaugural address, we must take action against both the bribe-taker and the bribe-giver. Surely we must be more aggressive against those who pay grease money to facilitate transactions with government. We will provide the ombudsman all the assistance in carrying out a successful campaign against graft and corruption.
In aid of this campaign, I urge Congress to pass a bill which addresses economic crimes and heavily penalizes graft and corruption. The bill could be patterned after the well-known RICO statute in the United States.
The overriding principle we must establish in government is that only by joint action—at national and local level—can we ever hope to achieve our goals and aspirations.
While many of our problems are national in scope, they exist in neighborhoods and local communities. Hence, the solutions must in the end be tailored to local needs.
While our problems require a broad national strategy and the political will to attack them, our response must be enriched by local perspectives and private sector participation.
No program—no matter how generously funded—an hope to uproot problems if it is based or developed solely in Manila. It must be founded on the life and experience of our local communities and enhanced by private sector involvement.
This is why we must move with dispatch. This is why I have established extension offices of the presidency in the Visayas and Mindanao. We must translate into reality the principles embodied in the landmark Local Government Code of 1991.
Precisely because decentralization departs drastically from tradition, we must nurture the process of change to ensure our local governments are empowered to cope, not just by law but by our aid and intervention in Congress and the executive.
Finally, I want to endorse in the strongest terms the passage of an act strengthening the Metro Manila Authority.
To live in Metro Manila today is literally a punishment—to exist with garbage, smog, traffic congestion, flood, and substandard public services. The atomized jurisdictions in the metropolis cannot deal with problems that are collective in nature. The only answer is a metropolitan administration that will deliver basic services effectively to all of Metro Manila.
And it should be an administration headed by an appointive Metro Manila governor. No one should fear by such title the emergence of a new political personality who will dwarf elected Metro officials. His will be a strictly service-oriented office, nonelective, and fully subject to recall by the test of effectiveness.
In foreign relations, we must chart our course in a world—and an Asia-Pacific region—much changed by recent events. The end of the Cold War may have eased the danger of a nuclear confrontation. But, ironically, the loosening of big-power tensions makes more likely the breaking out of quarrels within the region—which the superpowers once restrained, for fear of getting involved in them. Fortunately, there are few such quarrels threatening our part of the world. For the moment, securing continued access to world markets and technology must become the most vital concern of ourselves and our regional partners.
We have started reorienting our diplomatic service, to focus it on foreign trade and investment—in a word, to make it a tool of our effort at export-oriented development.
To the extent consistent with our constitutional responsibilities, let us together frame our foreign policy in a spirit of bipartisanship. And let it be truly national in character.
Our external defense we had implicitly entrusted to the Americans, under an a military assistance agreement and a military bases agreement with the United States. This had enabled us to get away with the smallest defense investment in ASEAN. Those agreements have already lapsed.
Now we must take up the responsibility for our own defense. Most urgently, the capabilities of both our Navy and our Air Force must make a quantum leap. And we shall have to accelerate our entire self-reliance program for the armed forces. Fortunately, this program will have beneficial side effects that are more than just military—in the transfer of technology, in job generation, and even in the potential export of defense products.
I believe—with all my heart—that our people and our country can be sure, now more than ever, of the loyalty, dedication and efficiency of their armed forces and national police. Let us give our soldiers and policemen the support they deserve.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: It is time to view our nation afresh—to see it the way our revolutionary heroes must have seen it at its birth—as a nation in which the common good is attainable. For too many years, we have defined our national life in ways contrary to our unity and progress. We have defined our politics in terms of conflict and competition: it is time we defined it in terms of cooperation and union. We have defined economic effort in terms of profit and self-interest: It is time we defined it in terms of sharing and caring. We have defined our culture in terms of jealous provincialism: It is time we defined it in terms of pride and linkage—taking what we can from the best of others, and giving what we can of our best to them. We the Congress and the executive can provide the example and the leadership for such cooperation, sharing, and linkage. You and I can act separately—and achieve very very little. Or you and I can act together—and achieve much, much more. The time is short and our responsibility is clear. In our hands, ladies and gentlemen of Congress, is the opportunity to turn the remaining years of this century into the resurgence of the Filipino nation. We have it in our power to achieve this goal. We also have it in our power to lose this chance—and condemn our country to continued decline and failure. I know we shall not fail. I know that we shall do all we can—severally and together—to make our stewardship of government a good one for our people and our country. The need is here. The need is now. Let us not allow our troubles to disperse our men and women all over the world—to be the housemaids and janitors of more fortunate peoples. Let our problems rather bind us together in one concerted action to banish the sorrows of the past, confront the difficulties of the present, and redeem the promise of the future. And when our collaboration shall have produced the prosperity and well-being of our people and our country, then might we say we have lived up to the sacred oaths with which we entered office. And our people will say to us—well done. Thank you and good day.
Maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat.

MessageofHis Excellency Fidel V. RamosPresident of the PhilippinesTo the CongressOn the State of the Nation
[Delivered at the Batsang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 26, 1993]
“Let’s Seize the Moment!” 
Mr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker of the House; ladies and gentlemen of Congress; Your Excellencies; special guests; mahal na kababayan:
Noong isang taon, ang ating mga kababayan ay naghahangad ng panibagong pagsisimula. Ngayon, tapatan nating masasabi na nabigyan natin ang ating bansa ng bagong pag-asa.
A year ago, our people asked of us a new beginning.
Today, we can truly claim we have given our country that fresh start.
We have arrested the decline—of the economy and the national spirit—which had so demoralized our people.
We are concluding a just and honorable peace with the military rebels, the insurgents, and the southern secessionists.
A new spirit of cooperation existing between Congress and the presidency has avoided the gridlock which obstructed policy making in previous administrations. And this is as it should be. Executive and legislature are not meant to function in confrontation with each other.
Our investors and businessmen can almost take political stability for granted once again. The stock market index has reached a record high.
Window of Opportunity
It is true that in some of our concerns—as in the economy—the forward movement has barely begun. There is still so much to be done. But today I can report to you of a country and people renewed in purpose.
Analyzing our situation in April, the World Bank noted:
The Philippines now faces its best prospect for sustained development in almost two decades. A window of opportunity exists for the new government.
This optimism about our prospects is not unusual. It is shared by many—here and abroad. But “a window of opportunity” is only that. A momentary opening—which can close sooner than we expect.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress:
I invite you to join me in taking advantage of this opportunity and to seize the decisive moment together.
This is the challenge to leadership. Everywhere the old politics is in disfavor—because it has failed to respond to the transformations taking place in the world.
We must learn new ways of looking at the world. We need new answers to our problems. In this spirit, we offer a strategic framework for Philippine development.
The Strategic Framework: “Philippines 2000”
Modernization in our time requires the guidance and direction of a stable and resolute government.
Compare the Philippine State with the East Asian dragons. The East Asian States are able to assert their countries’ strategic interests because they are relatively free from the influence of pressure groups. The Philippine State, in the past, had been unable to act consistently in the national interest because it could not resist the importunings of oligarchic groups. And the economy had been governed largely by politics instead of markets.
Because of this experience, we now know that development cannot take place in our country unless we put our house in order. And this—to me—means accomplishing three things: One, restoring political and civic stability. Two, opening the economy: dismantling monopolies and cartels injurious to the public interest, and leveling the playing field of enterprise. Three, addressing the problem of corruption and criminality.
These three tasks—once completed—shall secure the environment for self-sustaining growth—and enable the government to positively and consistently act in the national interest.
Our strategic framework to establish effective government—of putting our house in order—so that our drive for development can begin—we call “Philippines 2000.”
“Philippines 2000” has two components.
The first is the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 1993-1998 [MTPDP 93-98]. Guided by the principles of people empowerment and global excellence, it proposes specific policies and programs to stimulate economic activity and mobilize the entrepreneurial spirit in ordinary Filipinos. I strongly urge your approval of this medium-term Philippine development plan.
The second component of “Philippines 2000” addresses the larger environment—the political, social, and cultural climate—in which economic growth must take place.
The crucial question is: Can we reform an undemocratic economy by using a democratic political framework?
Authoritarianism eased the way to economic power and higher living standards for our East Asian neighbors. In contrast, we are working to reconcile our democratic politics with an oligarchic economy left over from the colonial period—not by changing the political system, but by democratizing the economy.
The time for authoritarianism has passed—in our country and in the world. Instead of the discipline of command, we must invoke the self-discipline of civic responsibility.
We Filipinos have always accepted that people with more are obliged to help people with less—in the name of a common, compassionate humanity. This traditional moral code we shall make a principle of public policy.
The few who have can never be secure in their possessions for as long as they live among so many who have not. Let me now take up our most urgent sectoral concerns one by one.
A. POLITICAL STABILITY AND PEACE AND ORDER
1. Stability and Civic Order
Examples from East Asia teach us that the first—and foremost—requirement of economic development is stability, which is the long-term predictability of the social system. This is why we are seeking a comprehensive and lasting peace. As proposed by the National Unification Commission, we will pursue the “paths to peace” by undertaking social, economic, and political reforms that address the root causes of armed conflict; by encouraging people to participate in the peace process; by working for a negotiated settlement with the armed groups; and by establishing programs for the reintegration of rebel groups into the mainstream of society through a general amnesty program. At the same time, let us effect the modernization of our Armed Forces. The cooling down of tensions in the region enables us to set new priorities in defense spending.
2. Peace and Order
Peace and order are the other face of national stability. If we are to release the full energies of the nation, people who live, work, and produce must be secure in their persons, in their property, and in their homes. We have enhanced our institutional capability to cope with crime—through the overhaul of the command-and-leadership structure of the Philippine National Police. To this end, I propose that the PNP law (R.A. 6975) be amended to correct its many weaknesses. We will dismantle the private armies that remain. We will not allow any more criminal brotherhoods, as in Calauan, to exist. This includes purging local police forces of scalawags and bullies. Last year, I proposed we restore the death penalty. I ask you to enact that measure as soon as possible. We must show determination to prevent any reversions to barbarism. In particular, I see the merit of bringing the anti-crime effort to the level of the barangay and the neighborhood—by evolving new forms of collaboration between citizens and law enforcers. This way, we can steadily constrict the space where crime can operate. The challenge is clear: Crime can only come under full control when criminals—in or out of government—know we’re going to catch them, convict them, and jail them.
B. THE ECONOMY
Opening the economy is, likewise, a political task. In order to level the field of competition, we need to dismantle the structure of protectionism and controls, and restructure the monopolies and cartels that operate against public interest. On the other hand, we must encourage and support Filipino and Philippine-based corporations that have proven their efficiency, competitiveness, and civic consciousness. the critical question is no longer whether we will grow. It is how we can sustain and speed up this process. We have experienced a full year of steady, although unspectacular, growth. In the first three quarters of this administration, our GNP in real terms increased by an average of 1.3%. This is indeed modest—compared to the galloping growth of our neighbors. But this is no mean achievement, given our crippling power crisis. You gave me powers to break some of the barriers to the construction of generating plants that prolonged the crisis. We, in turn, ploughed through the maze of regulations and opened the gate.
Today, new plants are operating and others are under construction. The economy will soon have the power needed for growth. The power crisis is on its way to resolution because of the united actions of Congress and the executive branch. This is where our strength lies, in unity of purpose and harmony of actions. But these alone will not be sufficient for the economy to be strong and resilient for global competition. We therefore also have introduced reforms to restructure the system in favor of efficiency away from protecting the inefficient. We will continue policies of sound monetary management and containment of public sector deficits to ensure that private sector enterprise will invest, expand production, generate employment, and realize fair returns, particularly for exporters. As the power crisis eases, and as we carry out structural reforms, the economy should accelerate. The indicators are increasingly hopeful, such as:

Inflation went down to 6.7% and interest rates declined to 10.2% in June.
The foreign exchange rate is at a level that spurs exports.
Gross international reserves were at an all-time high of US$6.7 billion early this year.
Investments registered with the Board of Investments grew by 111% in the first semester compared to the first semester of 1992.

But against these, we must admit these undeniable shortcomings:

Revenues of the national government have fallen short of our goals.
Expenditures in public investments fell short of programmed levels.
Unemployment and underemployment have been reduced only minimally.

1. The Test of Reforms
What must we do so reforms will result in a robust and expanded economy? First and foremost, we must not relent in our campaign to level the field of business competition: Global competitiveness must begin at home. Government will not retreat in its campaign against injurious monopolies and tax evaders. And so, I ask for the urgent passage of anti-trust and anti-racketeering legislation.
Let us recognize that an economy controlled by rent-seekers cannot produce free competition and efficiency. The economy must be open to all who bring in new capital, new knowledge, new ideas, and new levels of efficiency. We must broaden the base of economic participation. Let us, therefore, make this Ninth Congress the instrument to free and democratize our economy. By all means, let us join hands in an economic summit—the sooner, the better.
2. The Financial System
The independent Central Monetary Authority assures us of a new regime of price stability. Opening of the financial system to foreign banks should bring more foreign investment and expertise. We have substantially recovered from the balance-of-payments crisis in the mid-eighties. The 1992 commercial bank restructuring package largely put to rest our problem on commercial debt. This year, we reentered the international capital market. Our two bond issues have been oversubscribed—confirming our credit-worthiness and international confidence in our future. But we must be prudent in availing of such credits. Instead, we should turn more to grants, concessional credits, and long-term loans. These will help fund our development projects. In response to recent reports on a supposed change in debt policy, let me state very clearly that it is in our national interest to maintain our current policy. Let us not risk curtailment of credit flows and cut the lifeline of business and commerce.
3. The Budget
I will soon submit to you, ladies and gentlemen of Congress, our proposed budget for 1994—detailing how we intend to finance our development plan. Our spending plan clearly states our priorities on how to do more with less. We will put the highest priority in those activities that pay the most dividends in productivity and growth. And we must resist the usual temptation to spend merely on what is popular just to win votes. The 1994 budgets should be approved by Congress well before Christmas 1993, well before the lights go on again at that time.
4. Resource Mobilization
To meet the requirements of the development plan, we must mobilize resources through greater revenue generation rather than excessive borrowings.
We have to increase revenues to cover current shortfalls and fund public expenditures.
Our tax base has been eroded by proliferation of exemptions, infirmities of tax laws, deficiencies in collections, and widespread evasion. Tax exemptions, while well meant, are often abused by the underserving. The revenues lost from the exemptions have escalated from P3.3 billion in 1986 to P25 billion in 1992—or two-thirds of the capital budget of the national government for 1993. This amount does not even include exemptions which have not been monitored.
So let us review existing exemption laws and replace them for those deserving beneficiaries with direct budget support—so that the whole system will be transparent, accountable, and manageable.
We also have to cure infirmities in tax laws—such as deductions for married couples with joint incomes.
In your last session, this Congress passed laws to strengthen the enforcement powers of our revenue agencies. For these I am truly grateful.
I have ordered both Commissioners of Internal Revenue and of Customs to use these powers to go relentlessly after evaders, smugglers, and dishonest collectors.
I am convinced that citizens will faithfully comply with their tax obligations if there are no free riders on their backs. But because of existing contractual obligations, the payoff from tax reforms may not be sufficient to finance the needs of development. I therefore ask the support of Congress for a new revenue package for urgent enactment. This will widen the tax base and rationalize the existing structure.
Reforms in tax administration must aim to achieve simplicity, uniformity, and efficiency. This is the best way to arrest the present epidemic of tax avoidance and evasion.
Growth cannot take place without some sacrifice from everyone of us. But let us agree that the tax burden must fall heaviest on those who can best bear it.
But we must not tax at levels that will become a drag on the economy. Consequently, I also ask your help to tap other public funds in special and trust accounts, such as those of the Philippine Tourism Authority and the duty-free shop, and make these available for our budget program. The law creating the Central Monetary Authority adds to the heavy demands on scarce fiscal resources that cannot be entirely covered by additional tax revenues.
For our part, we will accelerate sales of public assets and shares in private corporations, and get government out of the business of the private sector. I therefore ask you to extend the life of the committee on privatization and the asset privatization trust, which otherwise will end this year.
I also urge Congress to set guidelines for the Presidential Commission on Good Government in making compromise settlements on ill-gotten wealth cases—on terms fair to the government and only with those who have demonstrated commitment to help in the development of our country.
My vision of a tax system is a broad-based one with just a few exemptions and at rates that yield no premium to tax evasion, where all enterprises and citizens carry their equitable share.
5. Promoting Investment
Congress has acted quickly—and decisively—on the framework for investments.
We now have a real opportunity to secure a fair share of the investments flowing into the ASEAN region. What is important is that we continue to improve our country’s attractiveness for investments—by emphasizing our comparative advantage.
6. Industry
Manufacturing and other industrial activities can proceed with greater vigor as the power situation improves in terms of competitiveness and productivity. We will champion exports as the key to sustainable economic growth.
And we will redouble our efforts to disperse industries to the countryside with emphasis on the small and medium enterprises.
The former military baselands—which were the cause of so much concern on the departure of the U.S. military—have now become attractive sites for economic expansion.
Subic has become one of our brightest areas for foreign investment. Similarly, we have been able to move substantially to transform Clark Air Base and Camp John Hay from calamity areas to growth centers.
7. Agriculture and Agrarian Reform
We have identified key production areas [KPAs] for specific commodities—areas where not just soil and climate but also markets are most suitable. For example, if we concentrated on growing rice and corn only where they will best grow, with adequate irrigation we can produce as much grain—as we have been producing on 5 million hectares—on only 2 million hectares.
We can then free some 3 million hectares now devoted to marginal rice and corn growing to other uses—to pasture, to aquaculture, and to high-value crops. These efforts in agriculture must be matched by equally resolute efforts at agrarian reform. This reform has been often pledged, but only half-heartedly redeemed.
My administration has stepped up the pace of the CARP implementation. During this first year, we have acquired, distributed and titled some 382,000 hectares, with nearly a quarter of a million farmers benefited. This is 41% of all land titles distributed by the Department of Agrarian Reform during the last 30 years.
But you and I know agrarian reform is more than just the redistribution of land. We have therefore taken decisive steps also to ensure that the land remains productive for farmers. We increased agricultural support services and livelihood assistance to CARP beneficiaries. We encouraged them to organize cooperatives and to take advantage of economies of scale to enhance their productivity.
Last year we launched 257 agrarian reform communities [ARCs] nationwide—with at least one in each congressional district in the countryside—where farmer-beneficiaries can better feel the impact of localized support services in terms of higher incomes.
Our goal is to have 1,000 of these ARCs of progress by 1998. This is not enough, however, for the kind of rural transformation that we seek. We have to conserve agricultural lands. That is why our tax package includes a land conversion tax.
8. Tourism
In tourism, we are beginning to reap dividends from our efforts to improve the country’s image and develop “environment-friendly ecotourism.”
Tourist arrivals reached 1.15 million in 1992—up by nearly 200,000 compared to 1991. These generated tourist receipts of some $1.7 billion, an increase of 30.6% over the previous year’s.
Tourism arrangements made with our ASEAN neighbors and new tourism estate development will boost our earnings from this source.
9. Infrastructure Development and Energy
In infrastructure, we have requirements long neglected. Our network of roads, bridges, air and sea ports is grossly overloaded and poorly maintained.
Since the funding for our infrastructure development needs is immense, I propose the amendment of the Build-Operate-Transfer law to encourage greater participation from private capital. Such participation must now be motivated by risk reward for efficiency and without the guarantee of government.
In energy, the dark time is almost over. By year-end, we shall have added 900 megawatts to the Luzon grid. This should—once and for all—put an end to the brownouts in households in Luzon.
By the second half of 1994, we shall have reliable power service for industry.
In the Visayas, power has been adequate, and projects are ongoing to be sure that no deficiency occurs.
In Mindanao, the National Power Corporation has just announced the complete restoration of power normalcy effective today.
In rural electrification, we have energized 94% of all our towns and cities, and 63% of our barangays. But we should strive harder so that more of our countrymen shall have electricity. There are bills in Congress which we support to strengthen the NEA to enable it to carry out its mission better.
We continue to develop geothermal energy—a competitively priced, indigenous, and environment-friendly option. PNOC’s additional plants between now and 1998 will increase baseload geothermal capacity by 150%. More geothermal resources must be found. We therefore urge Congress to enact the Geothermal Bill to encourage more exploration.
Our development program in power is indeed designed to provide comprehensively for our industrial future.
C. ENVIRONMENT
In the past, many nations—ours included—tried to attain wealth by withdrawing from their ecological capital. We are all now paying dearly to restore what we took out of our forests in the past.
So while we still can, we must seek growth that does not exploit our country’s natural wealth. Thus, we strongly uphold our commitment to the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21—which is the global blueprint for sustainable development.
Over the past year, we banned logging in virgin forests, and restricted harvesting to second-growth timber. We continue to pursue a no-nonsense campaign against illegal loggers.
We strictly enforced the interim guidelines on land use conversion to preserve prime agricultural land.
We initiated the use of low-lead and sulfur-free gasoline.
And we closed down Smokey Mountain while providing alternative livelihood options for its residents.
Nevertheless, we need to provide an environmental protection outlook on old and new problems. We are therefore submitting new codes covering mining, land management, forestry, and fishery. In addition, we need laws to improve solid waste management and to set up a nationwide potable water program for our communities.
D. THE QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT
1. The Bureaucracy
A bureaucracy that is mission-driven, and manned by a well-motivated and innovative workforce, provides the foundation upon which we can pursue our goals vigorously. This is a critical requirement for securing our environment for development—a civil service honest and efficient to facilitate the workings of the free market.
One of my first moves was to issue Memorandum Order No. 27, ordering all departments and agencies to eliminate duplication of functions, achieve greater cost-effectiveness, and rechannel resources to priority projects.
But our efforts have been hampered by multiple barriers to change—which are, ironically, engraved in the civil service law. Although it was not so intended, the civil service law sometimes acts as a brake on efforts at reform.
It is time we addressed this issue together. Give me the authority to reorganize the bureaucracy—and I assure you that we shall achieve the kind of organization required for efficient, effective, and quality administration.
By the same token, let us recognize that an efficient bureaucracy depends on decently paid civil servants. I ask Congress to amend our existing compensation laws—so that government can begin to attract into and retain talent in the service—especially from among our best and brightest.
2. Administration of Justice
I know you are as concerned as I am about our people’s perception of the judiciary. I have said it before and I say it to you again. I have no doubt the majority of our judges are as honest, hardworking, and dedicated as they have solemnly sworn to be. But we cannot permit the erosion of people’s faith in the judiciary, which is the indispensable third pillar in our democratic system of government.
The most urgent problem is how to deal with our clogged dockets, with over 300,000 undecided cases in our Regional Trial Courts alone.
And so, instead of just blaming our judges for the delay, let us find practical ways of helping them along. Thus, I urge the passage of laws which will relieve the Supreme Court of the burden of reviewing decisions of certain administrative agencies. Likewise, the jurisdiction of the municipal trial courts can be broadened. And we should also strengthen the barangay justice system and pass the Legal Education Reform bill and the proposal for an academy for judges and prosecutors.
The establishment of this academy is part of our program of professionalizing our prosecution service. One must now pass a qualifying examination as part of the requirements for entry into the national prosecution service. The performance of our prosecutors’ field offices is now monitored and evaluated on a quarterly basis.
For a more focused rehabilitation of our prisoners, we are now reviewing a program to regionalize our prison system, which will also free a vast and valuable asset in Muntinlupa.
3. Local Government
The improvement of administration at national level must be matched by a similar advance in local government administration.
The expectations are high in our local communities because more resources, powers and responsibilities have been devolved to local governments. But the objectives of the Local Government Code of 1991 will be realized only with the proper use of these powers by local authorities.
We need to correct the law so that the mismatches in internal revenue allocations and the cost of devolved functions, which have disadvantaged some local government units, will be solved.
Effective governance will depend on the harmony of actions between national and local governments as well as among local governments themselves. Inconsistencies in their respective areas will disrupt day to day affairs of commerce and economic life. Devolved powers have to be exercised judiciously without conflict with national policies. And the use of resources has to be subject to the same discipline of prudence and accountability. The national government will extend assistance in enhancing the management capabilities of local authorities.
E. HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
Development is impossible if it is not people-powered and people-centered. Whenever foreign observers look at our country, their principal wonder is how we have managed to languish in underdevelopment in spite of our tremendous human resources, especially our labor force—their literacy, their competence, their resourcefulness, their high sense of moral values.
It is time we fully harnessed this precious asset to bring about greater productivity and social cohesion.
1. Population Policy
We have embarked on a clear population policy that recognizes the need to moderate our population growth rate. At 2.3%, it is the highest in our part of the world. This rate of growth impairs our capability to improve our quality of life. It strains both our natural environment and our resources for providing jobs, education, housing, health, and other social services.
Government has committed itself squarely to a family planning program based on choice—and with the goal of bringing down the growth rate to under 2% by 1998.
For this, education and advocacy are our principal tools. And we look to partnership with the private sector and nongovernment organizations in reaching out to our people.
We must achieve an appropriate growth and distribution of our population consistent with sustainable development. We must reduce—and eventually reverse—migration into cities and uplands and thereby check the congestion in our major urban centers and environmental degradation in our uplands.
2. Education
Ensuring full and unimpeded access by all to both primary and secondary schools is the most effective way of empowering ordinary people.
Education reform must also develop a curriculum strong in science, mathematics, and languages. It must include the enhancement of the conditions of teachers—in both their livelihood and their work.
Vocational education and technical training should keep to their basic purpose, which is to prepare young people for worthwhile jobs, and to teach new technologies that our economy needs.
College- and university-level education should focus on developing competent professionals and on nurturing a culture of scientific excellence.
We will expand the public school network to the rural barangays which are still without public elementary schools, and all municipalities still without any high school, public or private.
All these require fundamental reorientation of our values and a continuing review of our education and training policies.
3. Health Care
Of all government public services, we have reason to be proud of our National Health Care Program. For several years now, health care stood high in our people’s esteem because service delivery is sustained and dedicated. We have moved to improve these services further.
In particular, government has implemented new policies and programs to increase life expectancy by extensive immunization, improved nutrition, and environmental sanitation.
4. Housing
We look at the housing problem not only as an opportunity to propel economic activity but more as a challenge to alleviate the sad plight of our people in our slum dwellings.
The challenge is to ensure continued investments in low-cost housing through stable financing and by devising new and imaginative arrangements that will maximize the private sector’s role.
I will certify to Congress a bill that makes contributions to Pag-IBIG mandatory beyond a certain salary ceiling and taps other sources for socialized housing. This will help raise funds for the housing effort.
F. FOREIGN RELATIONS
In foreign relations, we too, are striking out in new directions.
The visits I have been making to our neighbors are meant to signal the priority we are giving to ASEAN and the larger Asia-Pacific region.
With the United States, we are entering a new era based on partnership and cooperation—while further strengthening our relationships with Europe and the countries of the Middle East.
Now more than ever, we must place our diplomacy in the service of our economy and our external security.
Our foreign missions have focused on attracting investments, developing export markets, promoting tourism; gathering economic information, and facilitating the inflow of development aid.
In cooperation with our partners in ASEAN, we are promoting confidence-building measures among the claimants to the disputed areas of the South China Sea. And we are taking part in our cooperative arrangements to advance regional security.
In addition to our preferential trade arrangements, we in ASEAN have also come together to give our six countries the economic weight, the cultural variety, the talent pool, the technological resilience, and the attractiveness to investors that we need to become a major player in the world.
G. FIGHTING POVERTY
The central thrust of all our programs is the alleviation of poverty. We must fight poverty in ways that will not merely wait for the economy to develop.
We must make sure that growth is broad-based and socially equitable—that growth leaves no social group behind.
Particularly vulnerable are our marginalized sectors—subsistence farmers and agricultural workers, marginal fishermen, cultural communities, the elderly, the disabled, the street children, the urban underclass of unskilled workers, squatters, and their families.
The economy’s return to growth shall by itself help ease poverty. But we shall also be needing focused, targeted, and specific safety nets for these vulnerable groups. We are therefore partial to policies and programs that encourage community organizing to attain self-reliance for the poor communities. And we will match their self-organizing initiatives with more social expenditures, food and education subsidies, rural credit, and livelihood programs.
All of these we should do. We cannot leave our poor to wait for the benefits from economic growth to trickle down to where they are.
Toward Self-Sustaining Growth
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress:
In closing, let me declare that I do believe we have started creating the conditions for self-sustaining growth. We can end once and for all, by our cooperative efforts, the cycles of boom and bust which have characterized our economic performance.
But this much we must realize: reform will not come easy. Some reforms may bring difficult adjustments and even hardships before they do any good. The most we can do is to ensure that reforms hurt least our most vulnerable social groups.
The ultimate truth is that we cannot afford to fail—in our venture of reform and development. The consequences of failure will be grave.
Radical insurgency should never flare up all over again: These last 18 years, it has already cost us 40,000 dead.
The roots of Philippine rebellion lie deeply buried in the poverty, inequality, and injustice of our social system; in the inefficiency, corruption, indifference, and arrogance of those in power. Again and again, the violence of rebellion has broken out—in leftist insurgencies, military mutinies, and separatist movements. We cannot keep using force and violence to suppress these outbreaks. We must try to recognize their root causes so that we can apply lasting solutions. To do that, we must understand how far rebels are motivated by people’s frustrations over their inability to break through the barriers and patterns of oligarchic power that control their lives.
Only then can we redress, once and for all, the imbalance in national society between the few who are rich and the many who are poor. Only then can we make economic growth meaningful to the masses of our people.
We are at a critical hour in our life as a nation. Depending on how we act, our country shall either prosper or falter. Depending on how well we match our words with deeds, our nation shall enter into its second century dragged down by crisis and factionalism—or raised by achievement and pride.
Our history teaches us that the exercise of power must be guided by principle. For power exercised without principle is ruthless, and principle without the exercise of power cannot move our nation forward.
Mga mahal na kababayan, sa tulong at gabay ng ating Panginoon, magsimula na tayong kumilos upang harapin ang dakilang kapalaran na ating inaasam.
Invoking God’s blessings, let us move forward and fulfill our destiny.
Mabuhay ang “Philippines 2000!!!”
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas !!!
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat.

“From Growth to Modernization” 
Sa nakalipas na dalawang taon, malayo na ang ating narating—na magkasama—tungo sa ating nagkakaisang pangarap na mabuting buhay para sa lahat ng mga Pilipino sa pagsapit ng ika-dalawampu’t isang siglo. Ang unang taon ay iniukol natin sa pagsasaayos ng ating kabahayan—ang pagbabalik ng katatagang pampulitika, pagpapalaganap ng pambansang pagkakaisa, at pagpapalakas ng panlipunang pagsasama-sama—na kinakailangan ng pag-angat ng ating ekonomiya. Ang pangalawang taon ay iniukol natin sa pagluluwag ng ekonomiya—pagbubukas nito sa tunggalian, ang pagbibigay ng pantay-pantay na pagkakataon sa mga kalahok sa ating ekonomiya.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress:
Over these two years, we have come a long way—together—towards our shared vision of a better life for Filipinos as we enter the 21st century. The first year we devoted to putting our house in order—to restoring political stability, enhancing national unity, and strengthening social cohesion—as the requisites for economic recovery. The second we devoted to liberalizing the economy—opening it to competition, and leveling the playing field of enterprise. Already we are beginning to enjoy the modest fruits of these first reforms.

The insurgency no longer exacts the toll of dead and wounded it did over the last 10 years.
Approved investments over the first semester of 1994 have totaled P240 billion, more than double our expectation for the whole of 1994. Tourist arrivals are growing at 19% on an annualized basis.
The Philippines has reestablished its credit worthiness with the international financial network as well as regained the confidence of the world’s donor community.

If we began under a smog of skepticism, we have proved to ourselves how much we can do—if only we put our act together and pulled as a national team. Now that we have met our minimum goals, we can look beyond economic growth to the full modernization of our country. Laying the groundwork for modernizing our economy and our political system is the central task of this government and this Congress. And our end-goal must be to secure social equity for the poorest among us, particularly the basic humanities of life: to enable every single Filipino to develop his or her capabilities to their farthest limits.
The record of those first two years is appended to this report, which I submit for the Congressional record. Let me sum up its highlights before I move on to our legislative program for this Third session. First, political stability. To restore civic order was our most pressing commitment. That commitment you and I have redeemed. Armed with reason and goodwill, we are well on our way to a lasting and honorable peace with dissidents and insurgents. All-out war we reserve for criminals, terrorists, and plunderers. We have broken the back of the biggest crime syndicates, dismantled the most notorious armed groups, and effected changes in the leadership and chain of command of our police force to improve its credibility and efficiency. We will not consider this work done until every citizen can feel reasonably safe—at home, in the workplace, and on the streets. Second, the economy. We have begun dismantling the mechanisms of protection and privilege which have hobbled our economy these past 30 years, while also focusing it on exports and global competitiveness. The country now feels a surge towards growth that is fully supported by such indicators as low interest rates, single-digit inflation, a stable peso, sufficient foreign exchange reserves, rising investments, and the vigorous development of growth centers nationwide. Our GNP grew at the rate of 4.8% in the first quarter of 1994, and we are confident it will hit 5% this year.
Thanks to the statesmanship of this legislature, we in the executive branch were able—under a grant of temporary emergency powers—to end last year’s energy crisis. Through innovations like the “build-operate-transfer” [BOT] schemes, we are better able to rebuild our long-neglected infrastructure. We upgraded our science and technology manpower capability. By 1998, we shall produce around 3,000 competent scientists and engineers. We have also established two additional Philippine Science High Schools in Visayas and Mindanao. We will continue to fast-track the improvement of science and technology foundations of young Filipinos. Already these efforts have begun to pay off: not only in higher GNP growth and increased productive activities in the countryside, but—what is more important—in restoring to ordinary Filipinos the sense that life can truly become better, for themselves and their children. Third, the environment. Here our guiding principle is that future generations should not have to pay for the needs of the present. We intend to leave this Philippine spot on Earth cleaner and greener than we found it. Out of Smokey Mountain and Payatas—notorious symbols of our environmental degradation—will eventually rise new greenery, and new lives.
Fourth, social reform. In poverty alleviation, we have moved away from the old “trickle down” policies to “positive bias” for our poorest provinces and the numerous pockets of poverty that are to be found even in our richest cities. Our object is to help the poorest of our poor help themselves by expanding their access to health care, basic education, decent housing, credit, jobs; and by raising their productivity in their traditional occupations. The “Kabuhayan 2000” program alone should create 2 million jobs all over the archipelago these next two years. In land reform, we shall have redistributed, by the end of this year, more than 800,000 hectares of land. That is as much as the previous administration distributed in six years, and 12 times the hectareage the Marcos regime distributed in 14 years. Fifth, the bureaucracy. In our efforts to streamline the civil service—to improve the quality and speed up the delivery of public services—we have started right at the top: in my own office.
Sixth, foreign relations. Our country’s emergence from under America’s wings has given us Filipinos the chance—after centuries of colonial passiveness—to make our own history. We are renewing and expanding our contacts and friendships—in East Asia and North America—so that we can once again become attractive to foreign investment, trade, and tourism. I shall be visiting Western Europe in September to promote our trade, tourism, and investment programs in the European Union. The message I carry wherever I travel abroad is clear and simple: The Philippines is back in business in the heart of the world’s fastest-growing region. And we have committed ourselves unequivocably to ASEAN and its ideal of open regionalism. Together with our immediate neighbors and partners, we are building the regional architecture for our vision of a peaceful, neutral, and nuclear-free Southeast Asia.
How did we accomplish all of these things? We were able to do what we did—not by emphasizing ideology, but by seeking consensus and taking actions. Not by setting people apart, but by bringing them together. Not by charisma, but by quiet competence and patience, patience, patience. The lesson to us is clear: Without hard work, there are no miracles. We must perform as we pray, and pray as we perform.
Even as we consolidate our gains, we can now look toward the full modernization of our country. Three modernizations we must achieve: First, modernization of the economy—increasing productivity and competitiveness. Second, modernization of our politics—making people empowerment work in place of political patronage. Third, social reform—modernization of the Filipino family and the national community. We must prepare our economy for the new trading order ordained by the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Our survival in the evolving World Trade Organization will depend on how competitive our export industries can become. In politics, our task is to raise the national capacity of the state. Power must come not from force but from legitimacy. People power must be put to work productively. This I have always believed: We can develop as a working democracy—and not in spite of it. The electoral process we need to focus not on patronage and personalities but on public policies. And we must see to it every citizen develops as great a care for his civic duties as for his civic rights. In social reform, we must never forget we seek growth not for its own sake but only as a means to enlarge each citizen’s enjoyment of the benefits of our democracy, because no amount of growth will mean anything—unless it improves the lot of the common tao. The key reform is to give the ordinary Filipino an inherent stake in our system—the chance to own and manage an honest livelihood and to win his own future.
Let me now take up our tasks of modernization in more detail. The first modernization is that of the economy—to make it more productive; to make it competitive in the world; and to make room for the small- and middle-sized industries which are the building blocks of economic democracy. Export orientation is the only way to self-sustaining growth in our time—whose controlling element is an emergent global economy. In the first five months of this year, our exports reached $5 billion at a growth rate of 16.1%. This growth rate is expected to further increase in the years ahead. Protectionism for us had produced only retarded “infant industries” and a generation of political entrepreneurs who fattened on unearned income from tariff barriers, tax holidays, import licenses, and behest loans. Thus, both self-interest and international commitments compel us to turn our economy outward—toward participation in humankind’s shared adventure of development.
We signed the Uruguay Round of Agreements to improve our market access to the rich countries and to qualify for special treatment in world trade. The reduction worldwide of both tariff and nontariff barriers should benefit initially our exports of agricultural products, as well as of textiles and garments. In return, we commit ourselves to bringing down in a calibrated manner the barriers we have set up against the import of specific agricultural and meat products.
We have taken the following initial steps to improve our export competitiveness:

Through the Monetary Board, we are easing exporters’ credits by lowering reserve requirements; liberalizing outward dollar investments, and widening exporters’ access to loans from the foreign currency deposit units of banks.
The Export Development Council I have asked to implement strategies and programs to enhance productivity in export industries.

I have already reduced import duties on a long list of capital equipment our export industries need.
All the bills proposed by our cabinet clusters are listed in the annex to this address. Nearly half of them were previously certified as administration bills at the 1993-1994 session year. Others were agreed on at our first social pact of September 1993. I realize you may not have the time to decide on every one of them. We submit them all, nevertheless, as an indication of our priorities and concerns in the executive branch—while also indicating the ones which are, in our view, most urgent. The Public Works Act and the anti-pilferage of electricity measure which are in bicameral conference committee should now be acted on including the Magna Carta for Exporters which was earlier passed by the House and now on second reading in the Senate. In agri-industrial development, we place the highest priority on the bill on high-value crops, the mining and environment codes, and the House bill awarding protection to the ancestral domains of our cultural communities. In other areas of the macroeconomy and finance, we propose various bills to simplify our tax and tariff structures, enhance the investment climate, encourage the flow of credit to our rural areas, and promote long-term savings.
Our whole tariff structure, we mean to rationalize—to remove distortions brought about by differentiated rates, which have worked only to protect inefficient industries and penalize exports. We will continue, if not accelerate, the program to reduce tariffs until these reach one uniform rate. Simplifying and bringing down the tariff level is the best way to stop smuggling and corruption at the Bureau of Customs. We also need to recast our laws on trusts, monopolies, oligopolies, cartels, and combinations injurious to public welfare—to restore competition where it has disappeared, and to preserve it where it still exists. In a word, we need to perpetuate competition as a system to regulate the economy and achieve global product quality. To carry on structural reforms, level the playing field, and dismantle monopolies and cartels, we seek the urgent passage of various bills. These include the anti-racketeering and anti-trust/anti-monopoly bills already with you.
To improve government’s capability to provide adequate services and infrastructure for the economy, we seek an amendment to the Public Transport Service Law—last revised in 1952—to rid it of its restrictive regulatory framework and to foster a new competitiveness in our land, water, and air transport industries. Efficient transport must complement our breakthroughs in the telecom industry which has served to link our archipelago more closely by high-tech means. In energy development, we seek your authority to increase the capitalization of the National Electrification Administration [NEA], and develop geothermal energy fields. We must create indigenous power reserves to serve our expanding economy.
The second modernization is about politics and governance. Ultimately, modernization is about good government. If we are to improve the quality of our national life, we must first improve the quality of our governance. In our part of the world, the economic success of less-than-democratic societies is being used to cast doubt on the prospects of countries like ours, which seek to modernize as functional democracies. We have already given our reply to this false wisdom. But we cannot neglect the core of the authoritarian challenge. We must prove democratic government is not necessarily inefficient and ineffectual. We have gained much headway in preventing constitutional gridlock and in legislating reform. But we have not yet achieved the level of political will and national capacity that enable a nation to transform its dream of modernization into reality. The true measure of national capacity is neither the size of a country’s army, nor the way power is centralized in one man or group of men. It is how effective political institutions are at solving problems, mediating conflicts, carrying out policies, and implementing programs for the people’s welfare. To this end, we seek approval of bills to modernize the armed forces and the national police.
If, in the economy, we speak of the physical infrastructures for development, so in our political life, we must lay the administrative infrastructure for effective government. Of this infrastructure, no element is more important than the bureaucracy. Let me be the first to say it: We are not getting the full worth of every peso we spend on each government agency. But, then, we cannot make the bureaucracy do better just by scolding it—as we are often inclined to do. Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: I ask you again: Give me the authority to reorganize the executive branch, or significant portions of it such as the Metro Manila Authority [MMA], so that it can become the efficient administrator of our public life that it is meant to be. I fully support our local government units [LGUs] in their untiring efforts to deliver basic services despite financial difficulties. We are committed to bring to completion and full implementation the Local Government Code of 1991. I shall certify as urgent the bill that intends to allocate internal revenues more equitably to LGUs.
I take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the Supreme Court for its statesman-like handling of recent “hot” issues. Just as the country longs for administrative efficiency, so I feel it welcomes judicial statesmanship. We all know how major projects have escalated in costs—or even abandoned—because of lawsuits by rivals or critics. Judicial review of executive or legislative action is a basic legal and constitutional recourse. But the guiding principle for all—the legislative, the judicial, and the executive branches—should be to act expeditiously to avoid unwarranted delays which cost money and result in lost opportunities.
Step by step, we can make government more and more effective. I commend to this Congress the electoral reforms proposed by the Commission on Elections [COMELEC]. Said electoral reforms seek to modernize the entire electoral process, to include extending the mechanisms for voting of those absent from their voting centers by availing of the new electronic technology to contain electoral fraud; to speed up voting, counting, and canvassing; and especially to severely punish election terrorism. Our democracy is far from perfect, but it works well enough for us to be able to move it away from the politics of patronage, guns, goons, and gold.
The third—and most important—modernization we must accomplish is to bridge the gap between the few who are well-to-do and the many who are poor. Equality cannot wait until after the economic pie has grown much bigger because gross inequality by itself enables the powerful few to override the interests of the powerless majority in the making of public policy. Contemporary history teaches us that, in countries with vast income inequalities (as in parts of Latin America), substantial growth can take place—for prolonged periods—without easing mass poverty or liberalizing the political system. In East Asia, by contrast, sustained economic growth was typically preceded by some social leveling—through land reform, health care, and basic education—which released people’s energies for the national drive to development. Growth with equity is the kind of development to which we aspire.
Our social reform agenda is a systematic, comprehensive, and coordinated package of initiatives that addresses the minimum basic needs of the Filipino poor. This agenda was defined not by government alone, but in consultation with the social sectors adversely affected. Our agenda has both a geographical and a sectoral focus. It zeroes in on our 19 poorest provinces, which have historically received less than their due in government attention.
Ang ating repormang panlipunan rin ay nakatuon para sa mga partikular na grupo ng mga mahihirap na mamamayan. Dahil sila ay hindi iisang uri, ang antas ng kanilang pangangailangan ay nagkakaiba rin. Kaya’t ang mga tugon sa kanilang kalagayan ay dapat lamang na kaagad nilang madama at upang maging angkop ay maaaring magpamalas ng panibagong kakayahan. Ang aking tinutukoy ay ang mga magsasaka at iba pang manggagawa sa bukid, ang ating mga mangingisda, ang ating mga katutubong Pilipino, ang ating mga maralitang taga-lungsod, ang ating mga manggagawa na kulang sa pormal na kaalaman, mga kababaihan at iba pang sektor na nangangailangan ng tulong: mga kabataan, mga may kapansanan, mga matatanda, at mga biktima ng kalamidad.
It will also focus on specific groups of the Filipino poor. Because the Filipino poor are not homogeneous, the nature and degree of their needs are diverse. Thus, the solutions to their predicament must also be direct and creative. I refer to our landless farmers and rural workers; our coastal fishermen; our indigenous cultural communities; our urban poor; our unskilled workers, especially in the informal sector; and other disadvantaged groups: women, vulnerable young people, the disabled, the elderly, and victims of calamities.
After consultations with all these sectors, we have determined the need for three basic types of intervention. The first is to give the poor access to quality basic services—the very imperatives of survival for people living on the margin. The flagship programs under this agenda include socialized housing for the urban poor. The second is to give the poor better means to earn their own living. Priority programs under this agenda include intensified implementation of agrarian reform and a sustained “credit for the poor” effort. The third major item on our social reform agenda is a package of programs that will enable ordinary Filipinos to take part effectively in decision-making processes that directly affect their interests and their welfare. This includes a comprehensive and integrated shelter and urban development financing act, the setting up of a national health insurance system and a policy for intelligent population management. This agenda shall encourage the formation of people’s organizations, the strengthening of cooperatives, and the push to carry out local government code provisions on sectoral representation. It includes the grant of absentee voting rights to overseas workers.
The last item in my report to this Congress concerns the costs of modernization. The 1995 budget complements our objectives of consolidating our economic and political gains and deepening social reform. Our proposed expenditure of P384.7 billion is only 6.4% bigger than the budget you approved for 1994—just about enough to account for inflation. Yet we propose to spend 14% more than we did last year for social services. We are increasing investments in our flagship infrastructure programs as well as in “human priorities”—primary health care, basic education, safe drinking water, environmental sanitation, as well as family planning and nutrition programs. We shall also be spreading safety nets for those social sectors disadvantaged by economic restructuring. Fully 27.8% of the new budget will be spent on social services. Our eventual target expenditure for these human priorities is 5% of GNP. From a crippling 42% of the whole budget in 1986, we expect debt service to drop to 28.7% in 1995. In spite of the Central Bank debt and the continued borrowings made by the National Power Corporation, we hope to bring down the public sector deficit from 2.2% to just 1% of GNP. This greatly reduced public sector deficit is possible because the proposed budget of the national government for 1995 which I am submitting today aims to generate a surplus of ₱15.5 billion. Our children should not pay for what we now enjoy, rather, they should enjoy what we now pay for.
We are enforcing belt-tightening and rigid fiscal controls everywhere in the executive branch—including our public corporations—because we realize how precarious and fragile our economic recovery still is. You and I know development exacts a price—which all those who seek it must pay. That price we Filipinos have paid only reluctantly. Our current tax effort—14.7% of GNP, compared to the 18% average for ASEAN countries (Malaysia is at 22%)—is totally inadequate for paying the costs of development. In 1995, we intend to raise the tax effort to at least 17% of GNP. Without a stable revenue base, the Philippine state will remain weak and dependent. And for as long as our structural problems persist, we shall remain vulnerable to outside pressures and external political and economic shocks. You and I know there is no free lunch in the world out there—just as there is no freedom for the weak. Taxes are a necessary burden citizens must carry, and the best that government can do is to see to it the burden falls heaviest on those who can best bear it. Yet this judicious spreading of the burden, government in our country has not even been able to ensure. The Filipino middle class—and the poor—actually bear disproportionately the burden of paying for public administration. And, ironically, it is also they who suffer most grievously from the lack of basic social services which has substantially resulted from the very high rate of tax evasion by the powerful and influential.
This government is sworn to simplify our tax system, broaden its base, lower its rate, and make it more progressive. The system we propose is also economically efficient—and socially equitable. In the past, tax reform had largely been patchwork—meant only to plug the perennial fiscal deficit. As we move towards the 21st century, we need to establish a progressive tax system capable of consistently meeting the costs of development and modernization. Government also owes conscientious taxpayers the duty of prosecuting tax frauds and tax evaders—all those who seek a free ride on the public good without contributing to its provision. We will be especially severe on tax evasion by the powerful and the freeloaders—and on corruption among our tax functionaries. In exchange for lower overall rates, we propose to minimize the discretion of taxpayers and tax examiners.
The newly expanded value-added tax is meant to be a vital part of our tax reform package. It is designed to be more equitable, and easier to enforce, compared to the complex of 73—yes, 73—sales taxes it replaces. Those who propose to “kill VAT” denounce it as unfair and unjust. But, from government’s side of the fence, its main oppositors are mostly individuals of means who seek to evade their rightful share of the tax burden.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress: How then should we resolve this dilemma of development—of finding the money to invest in our country’s future? We must first of all resist the populist pressures being generated within our paternalistic political culture which looks at government as the exclusive source of goodies in our society—lest our representative system degenerate into what Peter Drucker calls “the pork-barrel state.” Thus, I think we should all get together quietly—you in Congress; we in the executive branch; with representatives of business and industry, the professions, labor, and the peasantry; as well as the churches, academe, media, nongovernment organizations [NGOs], people’s organizations [POs], and consumers—to reach a consensus on paying the unavoidable costs of development.
I shall be calling a second social pact—to bring together all those who oppose the expanded VAT law and those who are for it—to discuss comprehensive and progressive tax reforms—openly, frankly, and I hope, with civility—so we can jointly agree on where the resources to pay for community development and nation building are to come from. Together let us explore every possibility of where to find this money—whether by paring government to the bone, raising the penalties and punishments for tax evasion, privatizing public corporations and other assets, cutting your countryside development funds, or a combination of all these painful options—but let us together find the money to pay our way to progress.
Now to sum up: ladies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress: These, then, are the civic tasks for which we need your expertise, your industry, and your dedication. Our end-goal must be to lay the groundwork for the Philippines to become a thoroughly modern country, at peace with itself and with its neighbors, and where the least among our people have the decent minimum of material goods to realize the full possibilities of their lives. For a brief period in the early 1950s, the Philippines was second only to Japan in the vigor of its economy. and at an earlier time—now almost exactly a hundred years ago—we Filipinos had also proclaimed East Asia’s first Free Republic. Today we are struggling to catch up with our vigorous neighbors in economic and technological growth. But, perhaps, we are more than abreast of them in one key component of modernization. We Filipinos have already won our democratic revolution. History has made our culture of freedom proof against tyranny. Of course, freedom by itself does not bring about progress. But it provides the most enduring foundation stone for the good society we are trying to build—for ourselves and for those who will come after us. To lay that foundation and to move the country forward to sustainable development are the primary goals of my government. We face this task with optimism—confident we can bring the economy to takeoff, and complete a profound reform of the Philippine State—raising its political will, increasing its national capacity, and strengthening its social cohesion—before the dawn of the new century.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Ninth Congress: These past two years we together have achieved a great deal—in restoring political stability, in turning on the lights once again in our homes and factories, and in returning the economy to the path of growth. But surely, my beloved countrymen, our greatest achievement has been to restore our faith in ourselves, and in what we can do together as a national team. I have always believed we Filipinos are hardest on ourselves: We tend to dwell on our weaknesses, rather than build on our strengths. Perhaps it is because the kind of democracy we have known—for the better part of this century—has emphasized the individual over the community, private gain over the public good, and civic rights over civic duties. But, in truth, the concept of civic duty is the core of the historic tradition of democracy everywhere. If we as a nation are to endure, we must return to this self-discipline of democracy. As individuals and as a national community, we must embrace this principle of civic duty. Only by so doing can we attain the good society our revolutionary generation of a century ago had placed almost within our reach. The momentum of our economic takeoff must be fueled by every Filipino’s ardent desire to see our beloved Philippines returned to her rightful place in the community of progressive nations by the time of the centennial of our independence in 1998. I like to believe these past two years have brought out the best in us. We refused to be intimidated by the power crisis, natural calamities, and new challenges. Instead, we drew on our deepest reserves of spiritual strength, not only to survive and get by, but also—as I said two years ago—to win the future. Finally, my beloved countrymen, the future is dawning upon us.
Naniniwala ako na tayo ay nagpamalas ng ating kahusayan nitong dalawang taong nakaraan. Hindi tayo pumayag na humina ang ating loob dahil sa mga kagipitang ating dinanas—sa kakulangan ng kuryente, sa mga kalamidad, at mga bagong hamon. Sa halip ay humugot tayo mula sa nakalaan nating lakas na espiritwal, hindi lamang upang tayo ay makalampas sa kahirapan kung hindi—tulad ng sinabi ko noon—upang makamit natin ang magandang kinabukasan. Sa wakas, mga minamahal kong kababayan, ang magandang bukas na yaon ay unti-unting sumusikat na sa ating bayan.
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!
Salamat sa inyong lahat.

MessageofHis Excellency Fidel V. RamosPresident of the Philippines To the CongressOn the State of the Nation
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 24, 1995]
“The Best is Soon to Come”
Mr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; distinguished members of Congress:
Ang pag-unlad sa alinmang bagay—upang makamtan—dapat ay may sapat na puhunan. Ang ilan dito ay ang taos-pusong pagsisikap, tiyaga, at pakikipagtulungan. Noong lumipas na panahon, hindi natumbasan ang kinakailangang puhunan upang mapaunlad ang buong Pilipinas.
Development—we are often told—has a price that must be paid by those who want it. In the past, because we had been unwilling to pay that price, our nation could only falter and decline. Today we are a more capable people—and a more capable country because these past three years. We have paid a substantial down payment on development. The reforms we have dared to carry out; the hardships we have endured; the gains we have won—all these will reap benefits of progress.
Again and again, over these three years, we have shown ourselves—and the world—that the Filipino can succeed in the struggle for development, carry ambitious programs to their conclusion, and succeed, not by taking the authoritarian road but by democratic consensus and collective effort. The story of our turnaround I have detailed in an accompanying technical report, which I submit for the Congressional record. I also submit today the proposed 1996 General Appropriations Act with my budget message. The budget we see as our country’s bridge to the 21st century. In preparing it, we were guided by two things: First, that the only way to deal with limited resources is to have infinite resourcefulness. Second, our concern is not just to count every peso but to make every peso count.
Our economy is growing. This time, growth is driven by investment and exports, not by consumer spending. Inflation we have kept at single-digit levels and interest rates are decreasing. And for a change, we see the peso rise instead of decline. Political stability underpins our turnaround. We held two successful elections these past three years—proving Philippine democracy is no longer fragile as it once was. And we have gone some way in placing the common tao at the center of our development efforts—both as agent and as beneficiary. We have made diplomacy a tool for development. We are riding the wave of globalization—and winning for ourselves a place of respect in the family of nations.
Yet, these are only foundations to build on. Our work is far from over. The suspension of civil conflicts is not peace. The containment of crime is not order. Two years of growth do not add up to modernization. And the free-market economy does not necessarily work like the rising tide which equally lifts all boats.
Over these next three years, we have six major tasks:

One: We must adapt to the competitive world economy.
Two: We must reform our electoral system to cut down the power of money politics and to bring together, in the words of Pope John Paul II, “the realms of private conscience and of public conduct.”
Three: We must stamp out criminality—and its associated evils—corruption in the bureaucracy and police, and laxity in the justice system.
Four: We must prevent poverty from perpetuating itself.
Five: We must acquire the capability and self-reliance to account for ourselves in the world.
Six: We must raise the quality and integrity of our governance because only the competent and responsible exercise of authority can bring about our country’s modernization. Let me elaborate on these top priority tasks.

The continued expansion and modernization of the economy must be our primordial concern. This early we must ask ourselves: Can we catch up—and then keep in step—with our vigorous neighbors? If we fail to adapt to new economic realities, we will lag even farther behind. Worse, we may fritter away the gains we have already won. How then do we squarely face this challenge? How do we stay on track and accelerate our advance? God helps those who help themselves. Our economic turnaround is an achievement created—with God’s help—by our people’s labor and will. All that government can justly claim is that it has begun to create the environment in which business can flourish, and workers can create wealth, and secure for themselves a just share of it. We must press on with deregulation and liberalization and bring down the last of our self-imposed barriers to economic growth left over from the age of protectionism.
The other day, I issued Executive Order no. 264 promulgating a tariff reduction program that accelerates our economy’s outward orientation. Now I propose this Congress repeal the remaining laws—some enacted almost half a century ago—that still limit economic growth and deny consumers access to quality goods at lower prices. For example, in retail trade, the restriction designed (in 1954) to protect Filipino businessmen from non-Filipino competitors had long been overtaken by events. The once-alien competitors have all become fellow Filipinos. Yet, the old law ironically protects them from potential competition from the outside—to the prejudice of our consumers. Five other laws that should have been repealed or amended long ago include the Investment Company Act of 1960, which contains a provision requiring all directors of investment companies to be citizens (although, strangely enough, the same law does not restrict foreign equity in these companies). For 35 years, this restrictive provision of law has prevented foreign investors from establishing mutual funds in our country. With the lifting of foreign exchange controls, the Uniform Currency Act of 1950 should now be repealed to allow a free market in international financial and trading transactions. I also ask Congress to repeal the minimum capital requirements for foreign investors in wholesale and export enterprises under negative list “b”, and to delete entirely negative list “c” of the Foreign Investments Act of 1991. I further ask Congress to amend the Financing Company Act of 1969 and the Investment Houses Act of 1973 to allow unrestricted foreign investment in finance companies and investment houses. Moreover, we must take the necessary steps now to ensure the rapid development and expansion of our domestic capital market.
With this further economic liberalization, Metro Manila can now compete to become a financial and trading center in Southeast Asia and our archipelago can aspire to become a landmark in the borderless world of the future. Let us not delude ourselves: It is a brutally competitive economic order emerging out there. Many lean and hungry peoples are being integrated into the global economy. Competition is particularly fierce for trade and investments. And the countries most likely to capture these investments are those that set out the appropriate policies. We are fully committed to meet our commitments under the World Trade Organization [WTO], including the upholding of intellectual property rights in accordance with international conventions.
Ultimately, the pace of growth will depend on how solidly we build our platform for takeoff. That platform will be stable only if it is built on the rock of peace, civil order, and social harmony. This is why we have offered peace with honor to the military rebels, radical insurgents, and southern secessionists. We knew from the start the road to peace would be long and hard. But the alternative of bloody conflict and terrorism is worse. The initial successes of our peace initiatives are evident—the chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] campaigning peaceably in our southern provinces for a Muslim autonomous region—and the commander of the military rebels now belonging to this August body as an elected senator of the Republic.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: If the peace process is to be a test of government’s patience and forbearance, then I assure you we have patience and forbearance enough—and above all, the will to forge a just settlement that will endure. And if it is to be a test of our courage and steadfastness, why then, we have that courage and steadfastness, also!
In our pilgrimage for peace, you can count on government to walk the extra mile. But with the misguided few among our countrymen who have associated themselves with international terrorism, we will be much less patient and definitely more firm. Political fanatics no one can reach through reason and compromise. This is why I ask this Congress to pass an Anti-Terrorism Act, which defines terrorism as a heinous crime and penalizes it with life imprisonment or death. On still another front—in our war on criminality—we will be just as unrelenting. Crimes against women and children are particularly abominable. I ask this Congress to pass without delay bills which impose harsh penalties for rape and for child prostitution, pedophilia, and child pornography. You and I know criminality coexists with and is emboldened by corruption in the bureaucracy, especially in the police. This is why we have undertaken—once again—a comprehensive reform and reorganization of the national police. As we continue to rid the Philippine National Police [PNP] of misfits, we must strengthen the hand and improve the lot of those who bear the burden of protecting us in our homes, in the streets, and in our workplaces. I ask this Congress for the early passage of the PNP Modernization Bill and the amendments to Republic Act no. 6975. This will enable the PNP to further professionalize, upgrade salary and other benefits, acquire adequate communications and transport systems, and set up state-of-the-art crime laboratories. These measures must be complemented by your passage of the Crime-Control Act of 1995, which will harmonize the operations of our law enforcement agencies, particularly our campaign against loose firearms, private armed groups, and criminal syndicates.
We also need to raise the efficiency—and safeguard the integrity—of our judicial system. The executive and the judiciary have found the courage to cooperate—to reform the criminal justice system—through a recently established National Council on the Administration of Justice [NCAJ]. Congress has already done a great deal to help along this process by setting up a fund estimated at P2.0 billion for reforms in the judicial and prosecution service.
Even as we seek peace and justice for all, we must reassure our people that our political system works, and give them a stronger voice in the affairs of our nation. But this, our people cannot have—unless we change the mainspring of political power in this country from money, influence, and patronage to talent and merit. The most urgent measures are to

clean up the electoral system, so citizens can be sure that their votes are counted;
open the positions of political power to all who aspire and are willing to compete; and
ensure that the wielders of power are accountable to the electorate.

Our difficulty in achieving political reform arises not only from the lack of enabling laws but also from the weight of our traditional culture of “palakasan” and “palusutan.” Most of the rich and powerful still demand—and often receive—preferential treatment in the transactions of daily life—beginning with exemption from traffic rules to tariff walls for their monopolies. This focus on special privilege and special treatment we must remove from our culture. We cannot enter the 21st century with one foot stuck in the feudal era. As we speak of a “culture of excellence,” so must we cultivate a “culture of responsibility and accountability.”
Those who deride our economic performance and social programs as not having improved the lives of the poorest Filipinos use one of the oldest logic tricks in the book—building a straw man only to knock it down. Growth in a free-market economy favors the better-endowed regions, and the better-equipped segments of the economy—but only initially. As is well known, the long march to prosperity is measured in years and even decades. It is a journey we Filipinos have barely begun, although we can take comfort in the thought that each step taken brings us closer to our goal. But because the poor cannot wait—because, in Gabriela mistral’s phrase, the child’s name is today—we have intervened to put poverty alleviation at the center of government’s concerns. We reject the “trickle-down” approach. Our social reform agenda focuses directly upon the 19 poorest provinces and on specific sectors who are the poorest of the poor.
We are a long way from wiping out poverty. Right now, our more realistic goal is to prevent poverty from perpetuating itself. Our war against poverty must be fought by a strong army of citizens. We must mobilize not only government but the entire citizenry on the rallying cry of self-help and self-reliance. All hands—not just government’s—are needed to win this war. The impetus for any winning strategy should come from below—by harnessing the energies of the poor themselves. Thus, our approach to eradicate poverty is founded on three major interventions:

One: We need to build up the absorptive capacity of the poor by enhancing the capability of nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] and people’s organizations [POs]—such as cooperatives, livelihood associations, and self-help groupings—that are dedicated to them. I ask Congress to formulate innovative ways to provide resources for training, organizational development, and capacity building of NGOs and people’s organizations focused on poverty alleviation. We have allotted P74 billion in the 1996 budget for our social reform program.
Two: We need to improve our mobilization of financial resources—raised both here at home and from official development assistance—that are meant for the exclusive use of the poorest sectors.
Three: We need to synergize, consolidate, and streamline all of government’s strategies, programs, and agencies that address poverty alleviation into a more focused and better coordinated collective effort that reaches down to barangay level. We do, however, realize that the ultimate solution to poverty is providing enough productive and remunerative jobs and livelihood to our people. On my instruction, the National Economic Development Authority [NEDA] and Department of Labor and Employment [DOLE] are currently working with representatives of Congress on a comprehensive employment strategy, to create one million jobs a year and reduce unemployment to 6.5% by 1998.

As we pursue our economic development efforts, we will also improve the delivery and coverage of basic services to provide the minimum basic needs of our people—water services, electricity, housing, jobs, and livelihood opportunities, credit support, among others. We will further accelerate easy credit support for small- and medium-scale enterprises [SMEs] even as our financial institutions have provided some P47 billion worth of credit to them over the past two years or about three times more than the previous 10-year period. Our legislative agenda also includes urgent proposals for increasing family income and enhancing the welfare of our farmers, fisherfolk, industrial workers, and urban poor. We seek legislation to improve the urban poor’s easier access to decent and affordable housing. And I ask this Congress to continue its predecessor’s work of setting the framework of agrarian reform and modernizing agriculture—as the foundation of industrialization and sustainable, broad-based development. I ask you to give maximum legislative support towards the increase of the Agrarian Reform Fund, and to pass the Irrigation Crisis Act, if we are to make our small farmers competitive in the world. Furthermore, I urge Congress not to pass any legislation exempting more lands from the coverage of agrarian reform. I also ask Congress to pass the Fisheries Code, a law long delayed and eagerly awaited by our fisherfolks. We must also reach out to our indigenous peoples, so they can take part in our communal effort at development without losing their cultural identity. I ask this Congress to establish a Cordillera Consultative Commission to pave the way for a Cordillera Autonomous Region, and to pass the bill on ancestral domain, so that we can respond to our indigenous peoples’ clamor for the recognition of their ancestral lands. Our Muslim communities we must bring faster into the nation’s mainstream by providing a greater share of the resources for infrastructure and human resource development. On environmental protection, I ask this Congress to enact the proposed codes on forestry, the environment and land use. We must institutionalize our common conviction that nature is not something to be abused—but God’s blessing to be enhanced. God intended man to live in harmony with nature—not to ravage it. But protecting nature and fighting pollution starts with the citizenry—by keeping our homes, premises, and communities clean and green.
Our foreign policy today rests on three pillars: political security, economic diplomacy, and protection of Filipinos overseas. In recent weeks, I have ordered policy and procedural reforms to all government agencies and foreign missions concerned so that we can respond more promptly, adequately, and effectively to the concerns, problems, and difficulties of our new heroes—our overseas workers, of whom there are 4 million. Our “diplomacy for development” has brought dividends in trade, investments—and goodwill—while renewing our friendships in the world. We initiated Southeast Asia’s newest growth quadrangle—the East ASEAN Growth Area [EAGA]. As a founding member of the World Trade Organization, an urgent task of Congress is to further harmonize our trade, investment, agricultural, and industrial policies with our commitments under the Uruguay Round Agreement. This year we chair the Group of 77 consisting of 135 nations and we have a key role in the Non-Aligned Movement [NAM]. Next year, we shall host the leaders’ summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC], at which venue, we will continue to champion the development of the human resources of our 18-member economies, believing that every economy should make human beings the center of its concerns.
The Armed Forces Modernization Program enacted by the Ninth Congress enables us to improve our capability to defend our national territory, and to enhance our influence in promoting regional security cooperation. In undertaking the program, self-reliance will continue to be our guiding principle. This we will push to new heights by matching research with technology upgrading and production expansion in-country. But far more than merely acquiring or installing the latest equipment, the development of our human resources is the most meaningful component of our defense modernization. We need dedicated soldiers and highly trained, forward-looking men and women in the ladder of command.
Our relations with the United States, we must place on an even keel—on the basis of “trade, not aid”—removing the residual bitterness of her departure from Philippine bases. On our dispute with China over Mischief Reef and the conflicting claims on the South China Sea, we have worked consistently to prevent this issue from breaking out into open conflict, while proving to the world that we are prepared to defend our borders. In recent weeks, our diplomats have pushed for consensus on a code of conduct in the South China Sea that all claimants will respect. In Japan, far-reaching economic changes seem imminent, which should further open its markets to our products and bring a fresh wave of Japanese investments into our country. In Southeast Asia, recent events carry forward our hopes for the eventual integration of its 10 countries. Vietnam is poised to become a member of ASEAN. Laos is already an ASEAN observer country. Cambodia has acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. And with the encouraging developments in Myanmar, we hope it too would soon be drawn into the ASEAN process. Together with our friends in the world, we must work for the reform of the United Nations system—to make it a more effective instrument for multilateral peacekeeping. We seek the Senate’s concurrence on various treaties—all aimed at enhancing our economic, social, political, technological, and cultural contacts in the global community.
Finally, let me say a few words about the importance of good governance which is the foundation of sustained development. We have turned around precisely because we first put the house of government in order, and created a better climate for cooperation between the legislative and executive branches. I cannot overemphasize our need to improve government’s capacity and effectiveness. Our ultimate object is to assert the rule of law—to replace privilege with effectiveness, and establish the social cohesion and legal equality that characterize a working democracy.
The Ninth Congress passed into history without acting on the bill on emergency powers to streamline the entire executive branch. I trust this Tenth Congress will have the will to do so. Management teachers remind us that there is a difference between efficiency and effectiveness. The public agency and the public servant can be efficient for as long as they fulfill their mandate within the law—even if that law is already outdated. Effectiveness, on the other hand, has to do with meeting objectives at the appointed hour. Effectiveness is doing the right thing at the right time. In its present condition, our bureaucracy is saddled with structures and systems fit only for a bygone age. An old bureaucratic joke asks the simple question: “If it takes two ditch-diggers two days to dig a ditch, how long would it take four ditch-diggers?” the logical answer should be one day. but—in real, bureaucratic life—the correct answer is probably “four days” or perhaps forever. Indeed, we have made government the employer of last resort. By constant addition without regard to objectives, we have assembled a workforce too big to be effective—a workforce that spends an increasing amount of its time reworking rather than working, and undoing rather than doing. To fully support local government units in their effort to deliver basic services, we ask Congress to correct the imbalance between their financial resources and the actual cost of devolution to local government units [LGUs] under the Local Government Code.
I turn now to the key legislative reform I commend to this Congress for 1995 which is tax reform. As we move towards the 21st century, we must establish a Progressive Tax System capable of funding the inevitable requirements of development and modernization while simultaneously relieving the burden from our poorer sectors. We must simplify our tax system, broaden its base, lower its rates, make it more progressive, economically efficient, and socially equitable; and eliminate areas of discretion that all too often lead to graft and corruption. In this reform effort, we need not adopt new tax measures. We can efficiently enforce or modify existing ones, rationalize our convoluted incentives system, improve collection efficiency, and strengthen our capability to prosecute and put behind bars tax cheats and tax frauds.
Tax reform will also generate a recurring flow of funds we need to invest in human capital—in improving the health, housing, education, skills, and productivity of our workpeople. Families stranded in low-income occupations cannot prepare their children to be the productive citizens of tomorrow. We must help those children gain access to opportunities for self-improvement. In practice, the “equality” the Constitution guarantees becomes a mere abstraction without a minimum amount of economic equality in terms of housing, of health care, of basic education. The poor are the focal point of government’s social services, which are of course financed through the taxation of the more comfortable and affluent among us. Those of us who still regard the state as no more than a night watchman—whose only duty is to safeguard private property—live in an era long gone. If Philippine society is to become just and stable—if Philippine society is truly to transform itself—then we must ease the extremes of poverty and wealth left over to us from the ironies of history.
Mr. Senate President; Mr. Speaker; ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: On the eve of our Centennial of Philippine Independence, we find ourselves at the threshold of far-reaching change—change that promises to fulfill the dreams of our heroic generation of 1892-98. Not only the world has changed. The very basics of human and economic development have changed. The ability to create knowledge is rapidly replacing manufacturing power as the crucial factor among competitive economies. Information technology [IT] is the highway of the future, which compels the enactment of laws to promote this new sector of opportunity and challenges our science and business leaders to create our export niche for information technology products. We cannot remake this country without tearing open the old blinders and throwing away the old formulas. We will continue to develop only if we adapt and innovate continuously.
Many so-called “thinkers” make a profession of predicting the collapse of all our endeavors. The best reply to these prophets of doom is the continued success of our programs. Once upon a time, democracy was a millstone around our neck. Both those who sought to subvert the Philippine State—and those who sought to stop reform—used democracy’s means to bring Philippine democracy down. Philippine-style democracy is our competitive edge today, because democracy—by awakening and mobilizing ordinary people to the possibilities of their lives—enlarges tremendously our talent pool of enterprise, knowledge, and productivity. But let us not forget that the democratic way—by enlarging the latitude for debate and dissension—also demands harder work, greater cohesiveness, and social responsibility from everyone of us. If our democracy is to adapt to the dynamism—of society, culture, and politics—which is the wave of the future, then it must become more pervasive, more participatory. And government itself must become “user-friendly.” Its ruling principle must be to devolve, decentralize, deregulate, and democratize.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: In the drive to make our democracy work, we of the executive branch and you of the legislature must lead and achieve. I also urge those in media to enhance public awareness of our reform programs while they continue their support and impartial reporting of national issues. Let us remind ourselves that to achieve great deeds, we must not only plan and act—we must also believe in a shared vision towards which all our energy, talent, and time must converge. At our centennial in 1998, I want to see, as surely you do, our people in command of their destiny, secure in their values—yet creative enough, audacious enough to meet new challenges with productive solutions. I want to see, as surely you of the Tenth Congress also do, the beauty and richness of our land and our seas fully restored—a gift from this—our—generation to the future ones. And I want to see, as we all do, the glow of peace and hope and joy light up the face of every Filipino.
Mga mahal na kababayan: Pagsapit ng sandaang taon ng ating kasarinlan sa 1998, pangarap nating magkaroon ang ating mga kababayan ng sapat na kakayahang hubugin ang kanilang kinabukasan—matibay ang loob at malikhain ang isipan upang tugunan ang anumang suliranin. Pangarap nating maibalik ang ganda at yaman ng ating lupain, kabundukan, at karagatan bilang ating pamana sa mga darating pang salinlahi. Pangarap nating makita muli ang liwanag ng kapayapaan sa ating bayan at pag-asa, sigla, at karangalan ng bawat mamamayang Pilipino.
Salamat sa inyong lahat.
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!!!

Message  of His Excellency Fidel V. Ramos President of the Philippines To the Congress On the State of the Nation
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 22, 1996]
“Uniting for Peace and Development”
Four years ago, when I first stood before this legislature to report on the state of the nation, we could only see the future dimly—and not just because our provinces and cities were darkened by an electric power crisis. All that you and I knew then was that there are no easy answers—no quick fixes—for our ills. And the only things that sustained us were our belief that crisis can make heroes out of ordinary people—and our faith that we Filipinos can be greater than the sum of all our problems. Today, the challenge is to complete our victory over pessimism, stagnation, and decline. Today, the challenge is to give our next generation of leaders a firm foundation on which to build peace and prosperity for all our people. The correctness of our reforms so far has been validated by the growth of the economy and a new tempo of nationwide self-reliance, even at the grassroots, as expressed in our battlecry:
“Kaya ito ng Pinoy! Kayang-kaya!!”
We have demonstrated our own capability to manage our economy towards stability and sustained growth—earning the respect of the global economic community and making it unnecessary for us to depend on the IMF’s “Seal of Good Housekeeping.” Next year, we shall end 30 years of stringent economic programs under the IMF’s watchful eyes—and asserting full responsibility and credit for managing our economic growth and development into the 21st century. The IMF cites three reasons why our economy has overcome its historical cycles of boom and bust: First, growth today is being boosted by exports and investments—and not by consumer spending or government pump-priming. Second, growth is being accompanied by some increase in private savings and not necessarily by increasing external debt or foreign loans. Third, the economy has become more resilient to economic shocks.
Is our story to be told only in terms of these economic indicators? I say it is written even more vividly in the lives of individual Filipinos and their communities. Growth corridors, clusters, and centers all over the country are stirring ordinary Filipinos to new vigor, new ventures, new lives for themselves and their children. There still is great poverty among us, but every time we touch one family with our livelihood and social service programs; every time a quality job gives one worker a higher sense of dignity; every time we transform a Smokey Mountain into a decent place for human beings, then we loosen the iron grip poverty has on our people. The work of completion—of policies, programs, and projects—will define these last two years of my term. We must keep accelerating growth and social equity until they become self-sustaining.
In agriculture, to guarantee productivity and profitability of our primary producers, we must speed up building irrigation systems, farm-to-market roads, postharvest facilities; increase the flow of credit to our farmers, fisherfolk, and rural entrepreneurs; and optimize the role of women in agriculture. These must go hand-in-hand with our continuing effort to equip our farmers and those who make their living from the sea with the latest in technology. All these efforts should assure our food security and self-sufficiency. In energy and water, we must deliver electric power and potable water to our remotest barangays and humblest households. In this regard, we need more time to get the build-operate-transfer [BOT) and privatization proposals in place since water-related projects are much more complicated and take more time to put together than those in electric power. We can continue to fast-track needed water projects if certain provisions of the Water Crisis Act are extended. We Filipinos do not subscribe to the “grow now, clean up later” approach of some of the countries that have industrialized ahead of us. We are cleaning up as we grow: We intend to live up to the distinction given by Newsweek International last May of being the world’s first emerging “green tiger.” I therefore ask Congress to pass the Environment Code that is still pending in the two chambers. As we strive for development compatible with the carrying capacity of our ecosystem, we shall need a clear basis for allocating our lands to various competing uses. I urge Congress to pass—within this session—the National Land Use Bill. Likewise, I call the attention of Congress to the need for a continuing population program. You will recall that four years ago, we adopted the Philippine Population Program that aims to improve the quality of life through rational population growth balanced with the sustainable capacity of the environment and resources to support.
We are also reviewing the institutional, policy, and funding support for our small and medium enterprises [SMEs]—which have long been the “missing middle link” in our economy. The Magna Carta for Small Enterprises increased the loanable funds set aside by the banking sector for SMEs from about P16 billion in 1992 to some P80 billion during the past four years—but this has not been quite enough. Our export gains show we can compete globally. While our traditional markets—the United States and Japan—still account for more than half of all our exports, the volume and value of the goods that we ship to ASEAN and to East Asia are rising notably. Last year, our exports to ASEAN increased by 66%, and those to South Korea by 51%. Government must, in tandem with the private sector, upgrade our research and development facilities in the emerging technologies to enable us to add higher value to our export products. Over these next two years, we should complete our efforts to shift our exports from so-called high-volume standard products to high-value customized goods and services. We now project exports to grow not anymore at an average annual rate of 20% but at 25%—to reach $50 billion by the year 2000.
Employment levels too have been growing steadily since 1992. But since our workforce is growing at virtually the same rate as we are creating jobs, all our efforts have cut down unemployment and underemployment only marginally. We are, however, seeing improvements in the quality of jobs, and industrial peace keeps on getting better. The marked decline in strikes continues: Nationwide, they dropped below the 100-mark in both 1994 and 1995. But we must pursue a renewed, more vigorous, more focused effort to generate new jobs of the kind that assure our workers and their families stable incomes and improving quality of life. As for our overseas workers, we have made it a primary mission of our embassies to safeguard their persons and their rights. Our foreign office is even now engaged in several bilateral and multilateral negotiations on their behalf.
We have expanded our social reform agenda to cover not just the 20 poorest provinces in the Philippines but all 78 provinces and 16 administrative regions because we are giving special attention also to fifth- and sixth-class municipalities, where the bulk of our poor are to be found. In addition to being responsible for cleaning and greening their frontyards and backyards, I have also made local government executives accountable for the reduction of poverty in their respective provinces, cities, and municipalities. By the end of this year, we expect to graduate at least four provinces from the “poorest” category. For the first time, we are using an anti-poverty yardstick which we call the MBN [minimum basic needs] to measure how much is actually spent on poverty alleviation. Our budget proposal for 1997, which I am submitting today, contains explicit anti-poverty provisions. In public health, we have raised average life expectancy from 67.5 years in 1992 to 69.1 years in 1995; and cut down infant mortality, which is the most sensitive index of socioeconomic development from 53 per thousand live births in 1992 to 47 in 1995, and malnourishment among children of preschool age—from 14% in 1992 to 7% in 1995. In addition to our “Doctors to the Barrio program” to insure the delivery of health services to distant areas, we have pursued innovative and preventive health care programs which have gained worldwide recognition. In basic education, we have achieved almost universal access to elementary and high schools over the past four years. Now we are beginning to modernize our school system—both by providing them high-tech means to broaden pupils’ access to information and knowledge, and enhancing teacher training processes, especially in mathematics, science, and technology. But we still have a long way to go by the standards of our vigorous neighbors. While we have provided 3,500 scholarship slots per year to train students to become technicians, scientists, and engineers, we should at least treble this number in the next two years. In agrarian reform, we have achieved significant progress during the last four years in the distribution of agricultural land to our landless farmers. Nonetheless, we are only halfway to our final target for land distribution. We have to speed up the land distribution and productivity program between now and 1998, and Congress must both increase the ceiling of the Agrarian Reform Fund and expand its sources, and improve the adjudication system for agrarian reform. Other priority measures long awaited by our basic sectors include the proposed Fisheries Code for our fisherfolks, the Bill on Ancestral Domain for our indigenous peoples, and the repeal of Presidential Decree 772 which would decriminalize squatting and address the issues regarding the resettlement of the urban poor.
We seek stronger protection of the integrity of the Filipino family as the building block of the national community, and to guard the basic rights particularly of women, children, and young people, indigenous katutubos, the handicapped, the aged, and our veterans. In our programs for human resource development and as a prerequisite to sustainable development, we consider protecting Filipino children and empowering Filipino women among our highest priorities. As part of these efforts, we ask from this Congress the passage of the comprehensive juvenile justice system and a total approach against dangerous drugs—from education to prevention to law enforcement to rehabilitation to international cooperation—with the Department of Justice [DOJ] as the lead agency instead of the Department of Health [DOH]. We also seek the establishment of child and family courts to facilitate the speedy disposition of child abuse and family relations cases. Protection of the family and social integration of the marginalized sectors, especially disadvantaged women, also call for the passage of several other bills, including one long overdue which reclassifies rape as a crime not only against chastity but against a person. We are the first country, in fact, after the United Nations Conference on Women held in Beijing last September 1995, to direct all government agencies to set aside at least 5% of their budgets for gender equality concerns for the benefit of Filipino women.
In our drive against crime, we are making some progress—in reducing crime incidence, in improving our crime-fighting capabilities, and in fighting violent crimes. We have also made substantial gains in further reducing kidnapping and bank robberies, with better cooperation now resulting from community participation in crime prevention and information gathering. On the other hand, there is no longer any reason to delay action on the pending bills modernizing the Philippine National Police [PNP] and the Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP]. More than just replacing aging equipment and providing our units and personnel with the wherewithal with which to carry out their missions, boosting their morale is even more important. We are therefore committed to upgrade the equipment, training, and pay scales of our military and law enforcement personnel, including those of the National Bureau of Investigation and the state prosecution service. To this, I add: Let us not forget to fulfill our obligations to our veterans and their survivors whose pensions must be fully paid pursuant to existing laws.
Our country’s opening to the global economy and the uncertainties raised by big-power configurations emerging in our region and in other regions—all these have made necessary a broadening of our contacts and friendships in the world. The strength of our external security depends, above all else, upon good relations with our immediate neighbors. This is why we have placed the highest priority on reinforcing our relationships with our ASEAN partners; with Japan, with China, and all others with whom we share common borders. We have urgently brought the issue of the Spratlys to the world’s attention—at the councils of ASEAN; the Non-Aligned Movement; the ASEAN Regional Forum; and the ASEAN-China dialogue—and are now able to sit down comfortably with China at the highest as well as working levels to ensure that conflicting claims in the South China Sea do not anymore disrupt the peace of the Asia-Pacific region. And we are taking active part in the endeavor to build one Southeast Asia. All the 10 countries of this dynamic community are now either members—or observers—in ASEAN. All have acceded to the Bali Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. Last December we, their leaders, signed a treaty to keep Southeast Asia free of nuclear weapons. We shall be submitting this treaty to the Senate for its concurrence. Philippine-United States relations must continue to be anchored on our long-range policy of “trade, not aid” for mutual benefit and on our mutual defense treaty.
Over the foreseeable future, we see East Asia’s security interests as best served by a security balance among the great powers, and by their increasing economic interdependence. This is one more reason we are pushing for liberalization of the trading system through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Beyond trade and investment, APEC is also about cooperation to develop our human resources, strengthen our small and medium enterprises, and share technology and knowledge, among others—all these leading to a regional community anchored on mutual benefit and mutual respect. The 1996 APEC leaders’ meeting in our country this November will have great significance for our people—in terms of new jobs, higher incomes, and opportunities for technology transfer and market access in an interdependent Asia-Pacific.
In this government’s search for peace, we have made a solid breakthrough. Within two years, I am confident we shall leave our country and people a legacy of better social cohesion and political unity—on which future governments can build greater national capacity, stability, and prosperity for all Filipinos. Erstwhile military rebels have been reintegrated into civil society—even as the process of dealing with their grievances continues. Many of the reforms they suggest—in our electoral practices, for example—have been incorporated into our proposals to Congress. I therefore ask you, the ladies and gentlemen of Congress, for your concurrence to the pending proclamations granting amnesty to members and supporters of RAM-SFP-YOU as part of our General Peace Agreement of October 1995, and reopening the application period for all categories of rebels. With the dissident National Democratic Front [NDF], our peace talks have finally moved on to substantive issues. But we are no more than cautiously optimistic, because of the ideological issues involved and the hard-line positions the NDF has taken. Fortunately, that 60-year-old conflict has substantially declined in its intensity, partly because our amnesty program has enabled individual rebels to return to the ways of peace.
The Davao City consensus of last month with the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF], which envisions our 14 Southern Provinces and the cities therein being brought into a special Zone of Peace and Development [ZOPAD], with a Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development [SPCPD] to promote it, moves us closer towards the resolution of the conflict that has cost more than 120,000 Filipino lives, with so many more dislocated from their homes these past 27 years. I credit the patient diplomacy of our government panel chaired by Ambassador Manuel Yan, the new statesmanship of MNLF chairman Nur Misuari, and the consistent support of the Organization of the Islamic Conference [OIC] and our partners in ASEAN, notably Indonesia, for this accomplishment. From hereon, with our vision for a peaceful and progressive Mindanao clear in our hearts and in our minds, let us manifest together, my beloved countrymen and countrywomen, in all communities in the southern Philippines, and at the level of the national leadership, that same spirit of accommodation and mutual benefit displayed by the negotiating parties. Let me underline briefly the points that are being misconstrued in the rush to judgment on the Davao consensus:

One—No new area of autonomy has yet been established. The Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao [ARMM] continues to be the only area of autonomy in the southern Philippines.
Two—The SPCPD is not a provisional government; it is not a governing authority; and it has no lawmaking power. It has no power of governance over local government units. Neither will it have control and supervision over the local police and the military.
Three—The SPCPD is neither an autonomous region nor a political subdivision of government; it is not a public corporation; it has no separate juridical personality. It is simply a transitory administrative arm under the control and supervision of the President of the Republic of the Philippines. Its powers and functions are derivative and extensions of the powers of the President, which he may lawfully delegate.
Four—The new area of autonomy—after Congress shall have amended the ARMM Organic Act—will include only those provinces and cities which vote to join it, in a plebiscite to be called for the purpose.

Ladies and gentlemen of the Congress: Peace is a process and it must be carefully nurtured. So is development. Peace and development always go together. Together, both are our best weapons to alleviate poverty in Mindanao and everywhere else, because the lack of either one breeds deprivation and foments tension and armed conflict. Mindanao—as well as the rest of the Philippines—needs peace if it is to achieve the sustained, broad-based development its people deserve. Of the various proposals associated with our southern Philippines peace process, the most vital is ZOPAD, not SPCPD, because that is where all—especially Congress—can take part to make maximum use of a three-year period of respite and collaboration leading to sustainable development. Many voices—pro and con—from Congress, sectoral leaders, media, and from the affected communities themselves have been heard about our peace process, and I have taken counsel of them. But the decision to go forward rests on me as your President. To paraphrase an American President,
Now there are many, many people who can recommend and advise, and a few of them consent. But there is only one who has been chosen by the people to decide.
Now, I ask all of you for your support to give our government and our people in our southern regions—Christians, Muslims, Lumads, Filipinos all—the MNLF, our soldiers, our policemen, and the people of our divided communities included—this long-sought opportunity under our transitory arrangements to convert swords into plowshares. From every part of the globe, we do not lack examples of the futility of armed conflict as a way of settling ethnic, religious, economic, social, and cultural differences.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress: On this issue of bringing peace and making development happen in the Philippine south, I will continually ask you for your confidence and steady support. our quest for peace and development in Mindanao is more than a journey of a “thousand miles,” as the Chinese proverb says. Our forebears had made the first steps. And we, at this time, are now near the end of this long journey. I invite you now, ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, to join me in taking the last step. As your President, I enjoin everyone to exorcise the ghosts of history. Let us cast aside our fears and our hurts. Let us give peace and development a chance in the southern Philippines.
Resolution of our homegrown conflicts will free us to focus on sharpening our competitiveness in the Asia-Pacific and world markets, as well as in the delivery of social services to our people. Competitiveness goes beyond GDP and other macroeconomic measures. It encompasses the entire spectrum of the political, social, cultural, scientific, and value systems of a country. And the lesson from East Asia is clear. Competitiveness comes from an open economy, from a stable political system, and from a united, hardworking people. Competitiveness comes from modern infrastructure, and from workpeople trained in cutting-edge technology.
The 1995 World Competitiveness Report praises the extreme openness of our national culture: the availability of competent senior managers and skilled workers, the way we have internationalized the Philippine economy, and the way our exports have grown, in both goods and services. But it identifies our country’s biggest liabilities as the inadequacy of its infrastructure, its still-primitive transport systems, and the inefficiency of its distribution of goods and services. These, despite the gigantic strides we had made in the last four years in building roads, bridges, airports, seaports, power plants, and other public facilities. The report also warns how dangerously our human development lags behind those of our competitors—our lack of physicians, the continuing drain of our skilled workers, and the high pupil-teacher ratio in our public school system. In addition to this, we must worry about our severe lack of scientists, engineers, and technicians. Thus, we must work on the things that will make us competitive in the world. We must become more efficient in our social processes and in our educational institutions. We must continue to make substantial investments in infrastructure, but this time not merely depending on purely government expenditures but on wider private sector participation. We must make not just our business enterprises but the whole of national society competitive in the world by expanding research and development [R&D] in the emerging technologies and in education, especially in science and technology at all levels. We must raise the productivity of our farms, our factories, our small and medium enterprises, our workers, and our managers—for we are now just recovering from the inefficiencies that marked our economy in past decades. In this regard, we shall soon be completing a national action agenda on productivity which I have instructed the National Economic Development Authority [NEDA] to coordinate, bringing together efforts of all sectors who are involved.
Ladies and gentlemen of Congress—I urge you to act now on economic measures I commended to this legislature last July 1995—one SONA ago. To complete our liberalization of the economy, let us repeal the remaining laws—some enacted over 40 years ago—that still limit economic growth and deny the Filipino consumers access to quality goods at lower prices. Development, indeed, exacts a price that must be paid by those who want it.
This is why I regard as urgent and crucial Congressional action on our Comprehensive Tax Reform Package [CTRP]. The CTRP is the cornerstone of our government’s effort to put the Filipino house in order and to gear up our economy for the coming era of free trade. Beyond these, tax reform is also the key component in our effort to compel the irresponsible rich to take up their rightful share of the civic burden. Right now, it is our salaried employees and the middle class who bear the bulk of the tax load. We must simplify our tax system—broaden its base, lower its rates—making it economically efficient and socially equitable; and remove from it areas of discretion that all too often lead to evasion and corruption. Our other urgent need is to generate more internal savings. Our savings rate of 19% of GNP is still well below the East Asian average of 30%. Our landmark reforms in the banking sector are designed to increase the mobilization of domestic savings, but our social insurance schemes need to be restructured and their applications to health, housing, education, and counterparting broadened. This is why I have ordered an in-depth study of a National Provident Fund System—possibly consolidating the Social Security System [SSS], the Government Service Insurance System [GSIS], and others into one, and moving the entire combination towards private enterprise. Privatization will allow an enlarged provident fund system to widen its coverage, increase management flexibility in investing its portfolio, increase statutory minimum contributions, and decentralize its operations. Privatization and the spread of share ownership to ordinary Filipinos are at the heart of our thrusts for economic progress and social equity—by the democratization of wealth and opportunity. We are determined to shed the state’s discretionary economic interventions so that government can concentrate on its proper function—which is to provide the framework of law, civic order and infrastructure within which private enterprise can flourish.
The same World Competitiveness Report also notes the need for streamlining the bureaucracy and for reforms in our justice system. To accelerate such reforms, we need above all to improve dramatically the effectiveness of public institutions. We must simplify the system of regulations, licenses, and permits accumulated over generations of big government that have often become opportunities for corruption. The entire public sector we must transform from a regulatory into a promotional and developmental paradigm serving and urging the private sector to become globally competitive—similar to those that led to East Asia’s amazing transformation these past 30 years. Most crucial of all, we must pursue our earlier efforts towards a more disciplined, cohesive, and convergent bureaucracy, and make our civil service an effective instrument of the modern state. We must improve government services to the people by cutting bureaucratic red tape. A professional bureaucracy requires government to compete with the private sector for talented people. Although we have increased the salaries of civil servants below undersecretary level by an average of 40% since 1992, even now our levels of pay cannot approximate those paid by business and the professions. Improving the desired efficiency of public agencies and especially their effectiveness will not be cheap—but it will be public money well-spent.
That same 1995 World Competitiveness Report dealt also with the slow disposition of cases, which is most conspicuous in criminal proceedings. This has contributed greatly to popular frustration and marked erosion of people’s faith in the administration of justice. The strengthening of the barangay justice system and the designation by the Supreme Court of 56 special criminal courts required to conduct daily trials are giant steps forward. That this improved procedure can work, we see in the Ongpin kidnapping case, the trial of which took only 20 days. We need many more reforms—not only in speeding up procedures. We also need to increase the number of metropolitan trial courts and prosecutors. We should also upgrade the salaries of lower-court judges and those of the prosecution service to make their pay commensurate with their workload.
Finally, we shall need to continue reforms in our political system so that it can keep pace with our economic modernization. Generally, we need to keep down the violence, the vote-buying, and the cheating that still characterize our electoral process. Several other proposals for electoral reform which I support and are still pending include bills which would prohibit political dynasties and which would authorize absentee voting. We should also shorten reglamentary periods for our tribunals that decide electoral protests.
Ladies and gentlemen of this Tenth Congress: Again, I call upon you to pass the bills in support of our five priority programs, namely: greater political stability and national unity; economic and social development; energy development and infrastructure modernization; protection of the environment and natural resources; and energizing the bureaucracy. I am submitting to Congress the complete list of our priority legislative measures.
Our problems are far from solved. But we have definitely made headway in dealing with them. Even more important, we have proved to ourselves that our difficulties do not arise from some deep-rooted cultural flaw. They have arisen from policy mistakes against which we have exerted collective effort and political will to set them aright—today. Our heroic generation of 1896 animated our people’s ideals and aspirations. Surely, we, who are today’s leaders, can move our national community closer to the ideals of democracy, freedom and fraternity—of which our national heroes dreamt. Surely we can organize for ourselves a society where ordinary people need not depend on any patron’s charity, where they need not defer to anyone’s superior status, where they can realize the possibilities of their lives in a peaceful and progressive national community.
The 19th-century French scholar Ernest Renan defined a nation as
[a] community with a common memory—a people that has suffered together.
We are such a community. Before the political persecutions of 1872, there was no Filipino nation. We were merely a collection of indios, moros, mestizos, creoles, and katutubos—and the archipelago we inhabited was merely the name of a place. But after the execution of the martyr-priests Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora in February of that year, no further repression could prevent one Filipino nation—in Rizal’s words, ang Sambayanang Pilipino—from being born.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: Today our country calls us, not to die but to live for it. The patriotism borne of revolution and war must give way to citizenship for peace and development, which means personal commitment, social obligation, civic responsibility. If each of us pulled his or her weight, then we as a nation can be bound together not only by the common memory of our past sufferings but by the progress we can enjoy together. As leaders of our country and as its loyal sons and daughters, such is the pledge we must renew on this the 100th year of the Philippine revolution of 1896 and of Rizal’s martyrdom. In the solemnity of this chamber—keenly aware of the tasks laid upon our hands by our people and by our fundamental charter—let us seize this chance to give flesh and realization to our national beliefs and aspirations. On this the dawning of our centennial of Philippine independence, if there is one paramount achievement to which we Filipinos must dedicate ourselves, it is this—that by 1998, we Filipinos must show and prove to the world that we are finally a nation united.
Sa madaling salita: Sa taong sanlibo siyam na raan at siyamnapu’t walo (1998), taas-noo ang Pilipino na haharap sa buong mundo!
So, in this work we are to begin anew today, let us ask for God’s guidance and support—so we can win the new challenges of peace and development.
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat.
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!

MessageofHis Excellency Fidel V. RamosPresident of the PhilippinesTo the CongressOn the State of the Nation
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 28, 1997]
“The Challenges Still Ahead” 
Thank you Mr. Speaker. Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Vice President Joseph Estrada; Senate President Ernesto Maceda and Speaker Jose de Venecia; the distinguished members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives; honorable members of the Supreme Court and of the judiciary; Your Excellency Archbishop Gian Vincenso Moreni, Dean, and their excellencies of the diplomatic corps and the heads of international organizations; the ladies of the Tenth Congress of the Office of the President and of the Office of the Vice President; my colleagues in the Cabinet; leaders and representatives of nongovernment organizations and of the basic sectors of our civil society; the leaders of business; local government executives; the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the major service commanders; the Chief of the Philippine National Police; fellow workers in government; ladies and gentlemen:
Mga mahal na kapatid at mga kababayan, mga kagagalang-galang na bumubuo sa Ika-Sampung Kongreso: Ito na po ang aking huling pagkakataon na mag-uulat sa kapulungang ito hinggil sa kalagayan ng ating bansa. Mga kasama, maaari ring ito na ang huling pagkakataon para sa maraming kagawad ng Ika-Sampung Kongreso na makinig sa ganitong pag-uulat.
This is the last time I shall be reporting to this legislature on the state of the nation. It may also be the last time many of you in the Tenth Congress will listen to a State of the Nation Address from within these sacred halls. As we wind up, it is time we examine our political consciences by asking ourselves the bottom-line questions: Have we improved the lives of our people during our terms? Are our people better off today than they were five years ago? To these questions, self-serving answers will never be acceptable to political opinion. As for my administration, we are content—in any judgment of its record so far—to stand on the evidence of the economic and social indicators, the testimony of the experts, and best of all, the verdict of ordinary people.
Let us look at the key indicators over these past five years.

The growth of our gross national product (GNP) is perhaps the best-known indicator. And the record shows that GNP growth accelerated from 1.5% in fiscal year 1991-1992 to 6.8% in 1996.
Over the same period Filipino per capita income grew from US$840 to US$1,250 per head.

We have come a long way in stabilizing prices. Inflation is down, from 18.7% in 1991 to 4.6% this June. And this rate is well within the ASEAN norm, and we will remain well within single-digit in 1997. In 1992 our exports increased by 4.3% compared to their value in 1991. By 1996 our exports were expanding by 23.9% over those of the previous year.

Investment approvals in 1996 reached some P490 billion—increasing by 20.2% over the investments generated in 1995. In my much-criticized foreign trips—apart from their other benefits to our foreign relations—by themselves have generated an estimated US$21 billion worth of investments from 36 countries according to our Board of Investments. [Applause]
Foreign tourist arrivals grew by 16% yearly over the last five years—the highest growth in the Asia-Pacific region, while domestic tourism grew from 2.7 million in 1991 to close to 10 million in 1995. The prestigious International Retirement Global Index based in Geneva named the Philippines in 1996 as the number one retirement destination in the world.

In 1992, 781,000 new jobs were created. In 1996, almost double that number were generated—close to 1.5 million jobs—reducing the national unemployment rate from 9.8% to 8.6%. From 1993 to 1996, we helped 763,000 families own their own homes. And by June 1998, we shall have provided housing assistance to our targeted 1.2 million families including those in Smokey Mountain, those along “da riles” and those on top of the Pasig River. [Applause] Over the same period, we shall have distributed lands to 1.5 million farmers under our Agrarian Reform Program. In health, life expectancy increased from 62.5 years in 1992 to 69.5 years in 1997. And over the same period, the infant mortality rate declined from 53.6 to 45.8 for every 1,000 live births. And functional literacy increased from 75.2% in 1989 to 83.8% in 1994.
The sum of all of these indicators of development is that, over these past five years, poverty has declined—from 40% of all Filipino families in 1991 to 35% in 1994; and this targeted to go further down to 30% by next year when the next universal measurement shall be made. The results of the administration’s liberalization and deregulation program have been particularly gratifying. For example, in place of a monopoly in telecommunications, we now have nine major players with more wanting to come in. This has improved the national telephone density from 79 persons per telephone line 1992 to 19 per one line as of June 1997 or a 450% increase. In interisland shipping, we have many new routes and 556 new vessels. In civil aviation, we have more airlines, more flights, more routes, better service, and lower fares. And two years ago, we had all of five Internet service providers. Now we have 115.
Let us now turn to the judgment of the experts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) pronounces our country’s macroeconomic situation to be “very sound”—except for the lack of a few but critical components in the legislative program—specifically, the completion of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Package (CTRP), which we urgently need in order to exit from the IMF umbrella. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the OECD), the exclusive club of 29 rich countries, last February, invited the Philippines to take part regularly in the group’s dialogue with the so-called Dynamic Non-Member Economies. And the major international rating agencies are expected to upgrade the Philippines to investment grade over the next 12 months. And top executives in 10 Asian countries—responding to a recent survey by the Far Eastern Economic Review, said they expect the Philippines to be the third best-performing East Asian Economy in East Asia in 1997—after China and Malaysia. Yet the ultimate judge of how well a pair of shoes is made is not the shoemaker’s opinion, but the customer whose feet will hurt if the shoe pinches. And the ultimate measure of how well government works is in ordinary people’s own judgment of how its workings have affected their daily lives.
And so how many Filipinos have benefited personally from the programs of the Ramos administration? The prestigious survey institution, the Social Weather Station (SWS) which all presidentiables for 1998 want to quote—asking its respondents this key question—got this short answer: SWS says, two-thirds (65%) of Filipinos testified that they have benefited personally from this administration’s policies. [Applause] Reporting on the SWS survey results on July 7, 1997, SWS summarized the significance of these findings in three points:

One: A clear majority of Filipinos feel they have benefited from the administration’s programs;
Two: For quite a number of them, the scale of benefits has been large; and,
Three: All areas of the country and all social classes have benefited more or less in a measurable way. [Applause]

So, as we can see, all three: the socioeconomic indicators, the testimony of the experts, and the verdict of ordinary Filipinos agree that these past five years have made a difference in the lives of our people. But to me, these indicators signify not just incremental changes but a qualitative transformation of our and of our people country. In their totality, they tell us the Philippines is no longer trapped in its old cycle of boom and bust. And best of all, they prove to us our problems do not arise out of some deeply rooted cultural flaw—not out of a so-called “damaged culture“—but from policy mistakes that our due diligence during the last five years and from hereon as well as political will can correct. That past is now over; and a great era dawns upon us and a greater Filipino future beckons.
Kaya mga mahal kong kapatid at kababayan: Marami na tayong nagawa subali’t higit pang marami ang kailangan nating gawin. May kasiyahang dulot ang mga tagumpay na ating natamo nitong nakaraang limang taon. Ngunit, ang hamon ng kaunlaran ay naghihintay pa rin sa atin lahat mga Pilipino. [Applause] At ang darating na siglo ay magiging kakaiba kaysa panahon natin ngayon.
We can take satisfaction in what we have accomplished these past five years. But the challenge of development still lies ahead of us. And this coming century will be different from the one about to end. The future world will be shaped by at least two revolutionary changes. One is the adoption—on a global scale—of market-oriented strategies of industrialization. And the other is the phenomenal spread of information technology. Our reforms these past five years have moved our country into the mainstream of global commerce—into the middle of the profound changes taking place in the world. The opportunities—and the dangers—inherent in this new situation are many; and one of these contingencies hit the economy three weeks ago. Together with other ASEAN currencies, the peso came under intense speculative attack, forcing its depreciation. The peso-dollar rate has, however, largely stabilized if we look at the market today as of noon time, the peso-dollar rate stabilized and the PHISIX index went up—and why? Because our economic fundamentals are sound and strong. But there is no telling when another disturbance will occur. Let us be clear about what we should not do. We must reject all calls for a return to the closed, stagnant, and inward-looking economics of the last 40-45 years.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: The answer is not to retreat from the challenge of globalization. Let us not delude ourselves. Global integration is here to stay, whether we like it or not. The answer is to ensure our economy remains vigorous and sustainable—and resilient enough to resist outside manipulations and strong enough to compete in the world. At the same time, we must reinforce the safety nets that we have put in place for our disadvantaged sectors, our poorest classes in the archipelago. We must work hard to win our place in the world—because the world will not stop for those who stand idly by on the roadside of development.
Now that we can afford to think beyond our people’s immediate needs, we as national leaders must learn to look beyond the politician’s perspective. We must learn to plan and prepare—not just for the next election, but for the next generation. [Applause] We must learn to look to what the world, the region, and the Philippines would be like—not just over the next presidential term but over the next 10-15 years. These years that I mentioned will be crucial. Because they may turn out to be the last years of the post-Cold War era—the last years of the superiority which America and her allies enjoy. Just now, no new superpower is likely to challenge the United States. But this period of stability underwritten by America’s economic and military strength would not last forever. The future simply holds too many uncertainties. China’s intentions in the South China Sea; how a new Russia will evolve from the ideological ruins of the Soviet Union; how peace can be organized once and for all on the Korean peninsula; and how Japan will respond to the challenge of helping ensure peace and stability in our region—all these remain unclear. China’s rapidly expanding economy will unavoidably press politically and militarily on East Asia. And in the not-too-distant future, China will once again become a great power—and it is unrealistic for anyone to think that outsiders can prevent this from taking place. How China exercises its potential political, economic, and military clout must concern all countries of the Asia Pacific—and none more so than we who are closest among its neighbors, especially the Philippines. With our partners in ASEAN, we agree that our best approach to China is to draw her into the network of economic and diplomatic collaboration—for our mutual benefit.
The organization of an ASEAN-10 has been set back by recent events in Cambodia. But Southeast Asia’s compulsion to unity is so strong that it cannot be stopped. ASEAN’s Regional Forum (ARF) has drawn the great powers with interests in East Asia in a continuing dialogue to deal with regional security concerns, and among the most critical being—that the south strategic sea-lanes of the China Sea should remain an international freeway, open to all innocent passage. Toward this goal, I officially proposed in 1994 the demilitarization of the South China Islets claimed by six littoral states, and the cooperative development of their resources. In the face of this uncertain security environment, the wisest course for us to follow in our foreign relations is

First—To strengthen our bilateral relations with every friendly country; and our commitment to ASEAN, the United Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation or APEC and other international fora.
Second—To join with the so-called “middle forces” in the Asia-Pacific—our ASEAN partners and Australia and New Zealand—in moderating and calming the regional security environment;
Third—To support the continued presence of the United States in Asia-Pacific as a force for stabilizing the regional power balance; and
Fourth—To shift our Armed Forces of the Philippines from counterinsurgency to external defense and to develop a credible air and maritime capability to the fullest extent that our resources will allow.

Ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: We must take every advantage of these next 10-15 years to complete modernizing our beloved Philippines—to pull out by the roots the causes of internal dissidence—to shore up our external defenses—and to consolidate our unity with our neighbors in Southeast Asia. Only by so doing can we hope to assure the safety, the freedom and the prosperity of those who will come after us.
And how do we assure for ourselves the place we want to have in the future world? How can we find our competitive niche—and then defend it? The 1997 survey of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), a United Nations agency, forecasts the region’s gross domestic product (GDP) to grow within the range between 5.1% and 6.7% over the next 20 years. This is at least double the world’s average GDP growth over the same period. We were at 5.5% by last we report. Our economy must at least match this growth rate. If our country is to become a significant player in the Asia-Pacific, then we must now prepare the place we want to have in this future world. We must find our competitive niche—and nurture it. What are our basic strengths and distinct disadvantages? They lie in our democratic and open society; our archipelagic setting; our strategic location astride the Great Oceans of Commerce of the world—the Pacific Ocean and South China Sea; and in our talented managers and our adaptable workpeople. These are our advantages. We must build in this country the constellation of skills—the education, research and development, the work ethic, and the entire infrastructure of knowledge—that will enable us to develop technological leadership. To achieve these goals, I am submitting to this legislature, today, an updated technical report containing, among other things, our list of priority bills that we ask you, the distinguished ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress, to consider during this last session. The first thing we must do is to ensure that development spreads beyond the National Capital Region and our other metropolitan centers. We must awaken and energize all our regions—all our islands—all our provinces and cities and municipalities—to the possibilities of modernization. And we must tap the talent pool that still lies dormant in our 69 million people, the majority of whom are under 40 years of age. We must break the remaining concentration of economic and political power in a few—so that we can unleash the creativity, the resourcefulness, and the entrepreneurship in the many.
We have incorporated our peace initiative in the southern Philippines into a larger integrative process—to make our Muslim and indigenous communities an autonomous part of a plural national society. The Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) and its consultative assembly are now working in conjunction with the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM)—helping build political consensus, coordinating development projects, and aiding in law enforcement. In this spirit of unifying the national community and the furtherance of the peace process, I urge the passage of a bill to amend the Organic Act of the ARMM (or Republic Act 6734) to enable our people in the Zone of Peace and Development [ZOPAD] in Southern Philippines to fast-track their development within the realm of an expanded regional autonomy. [Applause] And in this connection, let me acknowledge the great contribution done by some of you in the House of Representatives led by the Speaker of the House himself, [applause] together with the chairman of our Government of the Republic of the Philippines panel, Ambassador Fortunato Abat, [applause] and the administrator of the National Irrigation Administration, Retired General Orlando Soriano, [applause] and the congressman who represents the particular district in which this breakthrough happen Deputy Speaker Simeon Datumanong, [applause] for now moving us one further but giant step into the final realization of peace and development in Mindanao. Likewise, ladies and gentlemen, this Congress must now pass the Cordillera Organic Act, which will enable—sige alsipat kayo, kakabsat ken gagayyem [applause]—the indigenous peoples of Northern Luzon to develop more speedily, while preserving their native culture and their environment. To make certain that development springs freely from the rice roots, we also must speed up the devolution of authority to provinces, cities and municipalities. We must remove the web of laws and regulations—administered at the national level—that restrains regions from developing each in its own way. And we must restore to local communities control over the political decisions that influence the way they live their lives. And, whatever we do, we must not allow growth to slow down—because only sustained development will enable us to finally wipe out Filipino poverty. [Applause] And we cannot allow our democracy to wither—because Philippine democracy is our unique comparative advantage in the new global order. [Applause] Only democracy can release the spirit of enterprise and creativity among our people, and without freedom, economic growth is meaningless. And so, freedom, markets, and progress go together.
Over these next 10-15 years, we must complete government’s unfinished business—the most urgent of which is to modernize Philippine agriculture. [Applause] We will never achieve a generalized increase in living standards without transforming our farming communities. But we must complete other reforms—like the liberalization of retail trade and the Anti-Trust/Anti-Monopoly Act—because this will make the market system work more effectively. And we must continue to lay the infrastructure of facilities, services, and equipment that will allow national society to function more efficiently. Today, we are building infrastructure at a pace the country has not seen in 20 years. For example, we have tripled over the last five years the budget for roads and bridges alone. This pace must not slacken. For example, we have completed the road from this Batasan Complex coming from your backdoor going to the other side—with a bridge over the Marikina River—to San Mateo, Rizal, providing an alternate connection between here and there—just in case. [Applause] In social reform, we have addressed the concerns of the basic sectors and improved the quality of life in the 20 poorest provinces, and in the poorest municipalities, the fifth- and the sixth-class municipalities in all of our 78 provinces. an experimental program we call the Comprehensive and Integrated Delivery of Social Services (CIDSS) has made a significant impact on the condition of 856 pilot barangays—and so, as our national response mechanism, the CIDSS, we are applying this program to deal with people’s minimum basic needs (MBN) in all of our poorest communities. The task remains unfinished; but I assure our basic sectors who are our poorest, that the executive commitment that we made in last year’s anti-poverty summit will be substantively finished by the end of this year. [Applause] And this we reviewed together in our eighth social reform council meeting only three days ago. Thus, I strongly urge this legislature to pass the bills in our social reform agenda [SRA] that remain in your hands, and have long been awaited by our basic sectors, namely—the Fisheries Code, the Ancestral Domain Bill, the Land-Use Code, and the repeal of the Anti-Squatting Law otherwise known as PD 772. [Applause] We have reduced the population growth rate marginally—from 2.35% in 1990 to 2.32% in 1995. But this still means our population will double over the next 31 years, from today’s near 70 million to 138 million. This press of sheer numbers will have a tremendous impact on poverty and on the degradation of our environment—unless we do something and unless we start now. And that Population Management Bill is now here in the Tenth Congress. [Applause] The plain truth is that we can no longer make do with economic leapfrogging because other countries are leapfrogging too. Our aim should be rather to pole-vault into the 21st century.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: Every cloud is said to have a silver lining and I agree. The recent speculative attack on the peso may have been a blessing in disguise because it gave us Filipinos the opportunity to enhance the competitiveness of the Philippine peso. We paid a small price for the long-term stability and resilience of our economy. Not only has allowing the peso’s depreciation conserved our foreign exchange reserves. It should increase the real incomes of our exporters; tourism-related industries; our farmers and fisherfolks; our heroic overseas workers and their families, and other dollar earners. It should also reduce our trade deficit; and complete the transformation of our economy from an inward to an outward orientation. Most important of all, it enables us to continue creating more and better jobs for our workpeople. Depreciation, of course, has raised some fears of inflation. But we are confident that it will remain well within single-digit levels, with corresponding price stability because, I repeat, our macroeconomic fundamentals are solid and strong. [Applause]
Financial sector reforms must focus on the need to keep our current account deficit at manageable levels. It is important that government now rationalize incentives to business to keep inefficient enterprises from proliferating. To promote efficiency and productivity in the financial sector, this Congress must now pass the remaining component measures of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program—both to simplify taxation and to increase revenue generation. We must also nurture a stable capital market—one that will encourage long-term investment confidence; mobilize efficiently domestic savings and foreign investments for our social and physical infrastructure; and work in conformity with international standards. Development of this capital market will require the passage of the Securities Regulation and Enforcement Act, and the Revised Investment Company Act—both of which are already with this Congress. And as practiced during the past five SONAs, I shall today—30 days ahead of schedule—also submit the President’s budget for 1998—all in the interest of sound financial management and the cost-effective utilization of public funds. [Applause]
In industry, we must press on with the reforms that have already brought about profound changes in our industrial capabilities. We must nurture especially small and medium enterprises, our SMEs, which generate the most jobs at the smallest capital cost. Already SMEs make up 90% of our enterprises and employ 40% of our workers in manufacturing. We are starting with the private sector a common program for creating 1 million new Filipino entrepreneurs by the year 2000. [Applause] The Magna Carta for Small Enterprises has increased the loanable funds set aside by the banking sector for SMEs from some P16 billion in 1992 to over P110 billion over the past five years. In agriculture, we have the natural resources and we have the manpower not only to feed our own people but to export to the world. What is lacking is a concerted and determined push to bring our agriculture into modernization. To spur the development of agriculture and industry, this Congress must now pass bills pending since 1995 such as the Agricultural Productivity and Irrigation Enhancement Act of 1995, [applause] which became the Propose Act of 1996; it is now 1997 which that provide more funds for irrigation, also agrarian reform and more electric power from renewable indigenous resources—hydro, geothermal, riptide, wind, solar, and ocean, et cetera. This would also support the fisheries sector; mandate the efficient allocation of land for agriculture and industry, and encourage the development of appropriate technology. We must continue to promote labor-friendly legislation that leads to worker productivity, and support the initiatives and programs of the Cooperative Development Authority. [Applause] We also propose the creation of a Water Resources Authority to integrate the 25 separate agencies now involved in various aspects of water management throughout the archipelago. This will enable us to unify policy and program development, and to cope with the nationwide droughts expected to happen because of the warm Pacific sea currents phenomenon known as El Niño. And we must be mindful of the need to “keep things clean and green as we grow.” The Ramos administration has led in the global effort to implement the UN’s so-called “Agenda 21” being the first country in our part of the world to put out its own National Council for Sustainable Development and putting out its implementing Philippine Agenda 21 (PA-21). This agenda of the United Nations on sustainable development requires specific executive actions to help nurture and preserve Mother Earth. We have taken cognizance of the fact that as we take an aggressive development agenda, we must match it with an updated, much stronger environmental management capability. That Congress has until now not passed any environmental act does not speak well of the Philippine state’s commitment to the global ideal of sustainable development. [Applause]
Deregulation and privatization have worked particularly well in transportation and communications and energy. These policies have encouraged a rapid growth in demand, enabling the private sector to offer more and varied transport services—like the Supercat ferries in the Visayas; the new airlines; and even big-ticket items like EDSA’s MRT3; the Metro Manila Skyway; the expressways extending to Clark, Subic, and Batangas port; and Terminals II and III at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA). Business response to our deregulation of the communications industry has even been more enthusiastic. And this has allowed the government to concentrate on completing our alternate long-distance telecommunications backbone—securing satellite slots for the private sector; and on dealing with high-tech crimes such as cellphone cloning and billing fraud—for which we will be needing legislation. Over these next few months, beloved countrymen, ladies and gentlemen, we will have two Philippine satellites launched; and we shall be accelerating the development of our information infrastructure. From this Congress, we therefore seek passage of the Public Transportation Services Act, which should broaden and enhance our initiatives in deregulation. I also commend to this Congress the Shipping and Shipbuilding Incentives Bills; as well as the corporatization of the Air Transportation Office and the merger of the Land Transport Office and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board into one National Land Transportation Authority. We are also working on the privatization of the National Power Corporation and the Philippine Postal Corporation as key elements in our effort to pole-vault into the information age. We must continually move our energy development and supply well ahead of electric power demand. If we get these things done, the distances separating our 7,107 islands will compress dramatically—as well as build virtual bridges over the waters, across the air, and into cyberspace.
Since 1992, we have worked to integrate our science community’s activities with agricultural and industrial production. Among other things, this made possible the operation of the so-called PH-net in 1994, which set off a boom in electronic networking. Science and technology scholarships granted by Congress have also widened our scientific and engineering manpower base. We have also established a network of institutes of molecular biology and biotechnology, to study biotech’s applications in agriculture, industry, medicine, and the environment. And under our pole-vaulting strategy, we aim to turn the Philippines into an Asian hub for software development and training. We have several bills relating to science and technology pending in this Congress. The highest priority we assign to the proposed “Magna Carta for Science and Technology Personnel,” which awards various incentives to our people engaged in science and technology. I commend to this Congress the proposal to establish a National Program for Gifted Filipino Children in Science and Technology; and the enactment of a law establishing a nationwide system of high schools specializing in the sciences and in engineering. And we must make more intensive investments in basic education, for basic education can unlock the intelligence hidden in every young mind. The same is true for our “dual-training” systems, “remote” educational institutions, and “open” universities. We must make our schools not only communities of learners where our children learn to read, write, and compute. We must make them schools of the future, which nurture young Filipinos to become responsible citizens and enlightened leaders of our country. We must now move aggressively to bring our people up to speed with the global economy. To create high-wage jobs in the future, human capital investments are the key. And in this spirit, I commend to this Congress—as a Priority Administration Bill—the Magna Carta for Students endorsed by our Social Reform Council. [Applause]
We must improve government’s capacity and efficiency across the board—in its every aspect from top to bottom. The bureaucracy, the civil service we must further professionalize and local government units we must begin to use as strategic partners in development. The administration of justice we must make impartial, swift, thorough, unsparing. Law enforcement agencies we should reform, reorganize, and modernize to raise their level of competence and their standard of dedication to their duties. We will pursue our fight against heinous crimes with greater vigor even as we continue to cleanse government of the scalawags and grafters within its ranks, whether in the executive, the legislative, or judicial branch. [Applause] And I ask all of you to join me in a crusade against dangerous drugs [applause], which threaten particularly our young people. And for this crusade, we need to amend the Dangerous Drugs Law and the passage of the Anti-Racketeering Bill. And we will employ the full force of government against the criminals, the outlaws, especially their masterminds, the drug lords, and the financiers [applause] who persist in challenging the rule of law and undermining the moral fabric of our society. We will hit them hard, again and again. [Applause] Social protection we must assure particularly for women and children, who are the most vulnerable sectors of our population. In this work, thankfully, the justice system has recently brought to bar high-profile pedophiles and abusers of children. [Applause] But we do need the enactment of the Anti-Rape Bill, which could have been done in your previous session. [Applause]
The entire political system we must make more responsive to the challenges and the opportunities that the new century will bring. We must reexamine the Constitution as thoroughly as the Japanese, the South Koreans, the Thais, among others, are reexamining theirs to improve qualitatively the state’s capacity to promote the interests of the national community, even as we recognize the people’s right—enshrined in the same Constitution—to seek its improvement. [Applause] And of the political reforms we must undertake, the most important include promoting a strong and responsible party system. We must encourage the radical Left as well as the conservative Right to take a healthy role in electoral politics as former military rebels and Muslim separatist have already done. And we must strengthen the institutions of direct democracy installed in the 1987 Constitution because accountability is the very essence of representative government. We must now pursue the electoral reforms still remaining, particularly in regard to computerization and absentee voting [applause]—this are still undone and we shall need them for next year’s crucial elections. Every successful election helps to consolidate democracy in our country.
Mga kagalang-galang na bumubuo sa Ika-Sampung Kongreso: ang ating “pole-vaulting strategy” ang pamana ng pangasiwaang Ramos sa mga darating pang panguluhan. Ang mga adhikain nito para sa pamahalaan at pribadong sektor ay hindi lamang taon kundi dekada ang bibilangin bago lubusang maging katuparan.
The pole-vaulting strategy I have articulated is the Ramos administration’s legacy to future administrations. The tasks it sets for both government and civil society may take not just years but decades to realize in their fullness. Carrying out the pole-vaulting strategy is inherently the shared responsibility of all levels of government and of all sectors of society. Hence, we should continue to draw on the spirit of unity, solidarity, and teamwork that has energized our efforts these past five years. Those of us who will be graduating can continue to help and to guide. [Applause] For my part, let me assure you—for my part the work of government will never slacken during this final year of my watch. [Applause] I will not be a lame-duck President for two reasons [applause]: First, because that is not my nature, and you know that very well. [Applause] And second, the times call for vigorous tigers and not enfeebled fowls. [Applause] I will be working and governing—you will all feel and hear and see me working and governing as your President—until I turn over the Presidency to the 13th President of the Republic at high noon on 30 June 1998. [Applause]
Ladies and gentlemen of the Tenth Congress: now to sum up and conclude. On this my last state of the nation report, my message to this distinguished legislature is as urgent as it is simple: we cannot afford to think only in terms of the next election; our people will no longer allow an attitude of “business as usual” in government. We must use these next 10-15 years—during which we may expect regional stability to continue—to prepare our people and our economy for the intensely competitive world of the 21st century. This “survival-of-the-fittest” socioeconomic order and political order imposes severe penalties on the inefficient, the unskilled, the nonproductive, the timid, the disunited, and the lame ducks. [Laughter] But great opportunities await the intelligent, the self-disciplined, the innovative, and the daring, the young bulls, and the tiger cubs. This is what we must resolve to make our beloved Philippines these next 10-15 years. We must complete the reforms that will make our economy, our society a more efficient creator of wealth; our social structure a more equitable distributor of benefits; and our political system the guardian of our democracy. Finally: How should I like history to sum up these years during which this country’s political affairs have been entrusted to the Ramos presidency?
Ito ang masasabi ko mga mahal na kapatid at mga kababayan: Ang pinakamahalagang bagay na ating nagawa ay hindi lamang ang pagbalik ng ating ekonomiya tungo sa pag-unlad. Higit pa rito, ang pinakamahalagang bagay na ating nagawa ay ang pagbalik sa bawat Pilipino ng ating paggalang sa sarili, paniniwala sa ating kakayahan, at pagtitiwala sa ating magandang kinabukasan. [Applause]
I would say this: The best thing we did has not merely been to restore the economy to the path of growth. I would say our greatest accomplishment has been to bring back the Filipino’s sense of self-respect and pride; of faith in ourselves and of confidence in the future. And in all of these, let me as your President and in behalf of our people and government, acknowledge from the depths of my heart the invaluable cooperation, goodwill, and support of the Ninth and Tenth Congress [applause] as political institutions and, likewise, to the great majority of the individual members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives, regardless of political affiliation. Together, we have labored hard and unceasingly to restore our nation to stability, growth, equity, and optimism, and for this, the present and future generations will be grateful. When that graduation day comes, we will have the honor to hand over to our successors, to the 13th President, in my case, and to the Eleventh Congress, in yours, a new kind of Philippines that our heroes of the centennial period envisioned—a Philippines that will endure through the new century dawning upon us; a Philippines where our people, under God, can live together in freedom, dignity, and prosperity, at peace with themselves and with all mankind. To all of you of the Tenth Congress, and to all our people, I say:
Let us go! Go!! Go, go, go!!!
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas!
Salamat po sa inyong lahat!

State of the Nation Address of His Excellency Joseph Ejercito Estrada President of the Philippines To the Congress Session Hall of the House of Representatives
[Delivered at Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 27, 1998]
Ang Pangalawang Pangulo ng Republika ng Pilipinas. Kagalang-galang na Pangulo ng Senado. Kagalang-galang na Speaker ng Mababang Kapulungan. Kagalang-galang na Punong Hukom ng Korte Suprema. Kagalang-galang na mga miyembro ng Kongreso ng Pilipinas. Kagalang-galang na mga kagawad ng mga Gabinete. Their excellencies of the diplomatic corps. Mga piling panauhin. Mga minamahal kong mga kababayan:
Noong Mayo onse, mahigit na 10 milyong Pilipino ang nagdesisyon na pamunuan natin ang bansa, patungo sa bagong milenyo.
Ngayon, sila ang nagtatanong, ano ba ang gagawin ng bagong pamunuang ito upang ihatid ang ating bansa sa bagong siglo?
Today, I stand before you with an accounting of the present and with a road map for our future.
Paano ba tayo itatawid sa krisis na nakabalot sa ating ekonomiya?
Nasaan na ba tayo ngayon?
Saan ba tayo nanggaling?
At saan ba tayo patutungo?
Hindi na ako magpapaliguy-ligoy. Nasa harap tayo ngayon ng matinding krisis na gumugulo sa buong Asya.
Ayon sa mga eksperto, wala pa tayo sa pinakamalubhang yugto ng krisis.
Kung babalewalain natin ang kinalalagyan natin ngayon, tiyak na lulubog ang ating bansa sa bigat ng ganap ng recession.
Malubha ang lagay ng ating ekonomiya, at namimiligro ang kabang-yaman ng bansa.
Ngunit hindi nangangahulugan na walang magagawa ang pamahalaan. At lalong hindi nangangahulugan na walang magagawa ang sambayanang Pilipino.
Sawa na ang taumbayan sa mga walang-kabuluhang pangako’t palabas. Sa harap ng matinding krisis na ating pinagdaanan nitong nakaraang taon, ang kailangan nati’y mga mabilis at mabisang lunas. Ito ang matinding hamon na dapat nating tugunan—tayong lahat: ang panguluhan, ang Kongreso, ang pribadong sektor, ang mamamayan. Mabigat ang hamon na ito—subali’t buo ang tiwala kong mas matimbang ang pinagsama nating talino, sipag, at kakayahan.
But let us first make an accounting of the present. A true accounting that is perhaps long overdue.
Nitong unang bahagi ng 1998, ang paglago ng gross domestic product [GDP] ay katumbas lamang sa 20 percent ng antas na naitala noong 1997.
Nangalahati ang produksyon ng mga pabrika natin. Pawang pagbabawas ng imbentaryo—at hindi ang paglikha ng mga produkto—ang ginawa ng mga industriya natin. Sa kanilang pangangamba sa recession, lalo lamang pinalala ang problema.
Bumagsak ang ating produksyong pang-agrikultura. Bumaba nang 14 percent ang ani ng palay, at bumaba din nang 24 percent ang ani ng mais.
Malimit nating tukuyin ang phenomenon ng El Niño, subalit ang tunay na ugat ng suliranin ay ang pangkalahatang sektor ng agrikultura.
Halos double-digit na ang ating inflation rate. Napakataas ang interes na sinisingil ng mga bangko kaya naman hindi makautang ang marami nating negosyante. At lalo namang hinigpitan ng mga bangko ang kanilang pagpapautang, kaya’t maraming kalakal ang nagsasara.
Dahil sa debalwasyon at sa El Niño, tuluy-tuloy ang pagbagsak ng ating piso. Ito ay lubhang mabigat para sa ating mga kababayan natin na isang kahig, isang tuka ang kinagisnang pamumuhay.
Unemployment is now 13.3 percent and still growing; underemployment, 20 percent and also growing. 4.3 million Filipinos need a job. Twice that number wish they had a real, full-time job.
Maaaring sabihing ito ay maliit pa. Subali’t paano mo sasabihin sa pamilyang gutom na mas masama ang kalagayan ng ibang pamilya sa ibang bansa?
One lost job is one hungry family, and one cold statistic I cannot agree.
Statistics claim that the number of poor people has gone down in the past decade. I wonder if the people believe these statistics.
Wala sa akin ang mga statistics na iyan. Poor is poor—walang pera, walang pagkain, walang bubong, walang dignidad, at lalung-lalo na, walang pag-asa.
Hindi lang iyan. ‘Yung mayaman ay higit pang yumaman, at ang mahihirap lalong humirap.
I wish that I could say that we shall set up a job security fund soon. But I don’t want to add to the inventory of unfunded laws and bills that now amount to P400 billion worth of promises that will never be fulfilled.
According to statistics, in the past six years, as the Philippine economy grew, the richest 10 percent got 40 percent of the national income.
And the poorest 10 percent? Wala pang dalawang porsiyento.
It is worse in the countryside, where 40 percent of Filipinos still work for one-third of wages in the city. That is why they come here. Only to find that there are no jobs, or none for which they qualify.
Noong araw, inakala ko na marami na kusang darating sa ating bansa ang mga banyagang negosyante dahil ang mga manggagawa natin ay mahuhusay at handang tumanggap ng mababang sahod. Hindi na ito totoo.
Napakababa ng productivity ng karaniwang manggagawang Pilipino dahil kalahati na lang sa kanila ang nakapagtapos sa mababang paaralan samantalang tatlumpu’t tatlong porsiyento lang ang nakaabot ng high school.
Ngunit limitado ang pondo na maari nating ilaan para sa edukasyon; may kakulangan tayong 24,000 silid-aralan, at 4,000 guro.
Hindi lamang sa larangan ng edukasyon—hanggang ngayon, mahigit sa tatlumpung porsiyento ng tahanan sa bansa ay wala pa ring kuryente. At sa boung Asya, sunod lamang sa bansang Hapon ang taas ng singil natin sa kuryente.
Sa larangan ng agrarian reform, na ngayon ay nasa ika-26 na taon na.
Only 57 percent of target areas have been distributed, while productivity has become lower.
This does not mean that the land should have been left with the landlords, but that the farmers should not have been left to fend for themselves.
This is where we are now. Add anarchy on the peace and order front, where the only thing organized is crime, and the only thing systematic is kidnapping. The result: capital flight. Yet some officials think they can attract foreign funds with tax incentives for potential kidnap victims.
Ang sinumang bagong Pangulo ay may pangarap at minimithing para sa bansa lalung-lalo na sa akin, na malaki ang inaasahan ng masang Pilipino. Ngunit gustuhin ko man na maibigay ang kanilang inaasahan sa lalong madaling panahon, paano ko ibibigay kung wala tayong sapat na pananalapi na igugugol para maiangat ang kanilang kabuhayan?
We have a P70 billion budget deficit and a consolidated public sector deficit that could go as high as P90 billion. Collection of taxes and duties are down, even as more and more tax exemptions and incentives cut deep into government revenues.
Government could borrow more. But that will only raise interest rates and worsen the economic slowdown. The result: less taxes and fewer jobs.
If high interest rates squeeze GNP by just two percent more, there will be half a million more jobless. But if we pressure the Bangko Sentral to print more money, inflation will shoot up.
Kaliwa’t kanan, may latay, napakahirap tumimbang, at sadyang malala ang problema natin. Gayunpaman, nasa ugat ng problema ang nakikita kong solusyon.
The problems we face are of such magnitude as to require nothing less than heroic and concerted action. We must move upon them as a single community, bound together by common rules that we all agree to respect and obey.
To begin with, we have to reduce the cost of governance, costs that go higher and higher with each corrupt act, with each wasteful project.
Bilyun-bilyong piso ang nawawaldas sa mga proyektong maaksaya at kulang sa silbi, at lalong malaki pa ang nawawalang parang bula dahil sa patuloy na mga kurakot.
Business pays taxes, but mostly into the pockets of BIR agents or customs examiners instead of the national treasury.
In 1998 alone, we can save as much as P34 billion from pork barrel.
P4.6 billion went to the centennial celebration, but the Department of Social Welfare had to beg for P100 million in emergency food aid to drought victims in Mindanao, and did not get it.
The 1997 World Development Report ranks the Philippine Civil Service as among the most politicized in the world, with politics deciding appointments down to janitor. The 1992 Corruption Index ranked the Philippines as the second most corrupt country in the region.
Debt service took 27 percent of the national budget last year; P26.4 billion in the first semester of 1998 alone. The total external debt, including the private sector, is $45.4 billion or P1.9 trillion pesos.
Nang ako’y maupo bilang Pangulo, nagulat ako nang ipaalam sa akin na umabot na pala sa P2.3 trillion ang kabuuang utang ng pampublikong sektor.
Hindi na bilyun-bilyon ang usapan ngayon, kundi trilyun-trilyon na.
We know where we are: in an economic slowdown, deep in the Asian crisis.
We know that we don’t have much to work with.
Previous leaders have laid down both political and economic reforms that make up an enduring framework from which we can further build.
But we race against time, as an impatient public ask us: When will those reforms pay dividends for the common man?
Well, we just have to begin now. With honesty, with thrift, with efficiency.
Tama na ang pagpapasasa.
Tama na ang nakawan.
Tama na ang aksaya.
Tama na ang mga palabas.
Kailangan magbanat tayo ng mgabuto, at tunay na serbisyo ang siyang dapat na maging balangkas para sa ating mga solusyon. [Applause]
Ngayon taon, mula sa inaasahang P93 bilyon, pababa sa P60 bilyon lamang, kailangang magsagawa ng mga kaukulang pagbabago at pagtitipid ang pamahalaan upang lalo pang paliitin ang inaasahang kakulangan nito sa P40 bilyon lamang.
In order to achieve these targets, we will resolutely pursue several major cutbacks in expenditure programs.
First, I have instructed the secretary of the budget to continue to withhold 25 percent of budget allocations, excluding salaries and wages, from the various national agencies, including the Office of the President.
Second, we will continue to withhold 10 percent from the internal revenue allotment of the local government units [LGUs].
Third, I believe that congress shares my conviction that we have to abolish the pork barrel in the face of our fiscal position. [Applause] Kakaunti ang mga congressman na pumapalakpak. [Laughter] Our people ask no less.
Lastly, I will postpone the implementation this year of various programs earmarked for funding from the military camp sale proceeds, including the AFP modernization program. [Applause]
We will also move quickly to dispose of the burden of government-owned corporations. I urge Congress to prioritize the bill privatizing the NAPOCOR within the first three months of the 11th session. Privatization of government shares in Pasar, Philphos, Petron, FTI, PNB, PNOC-EDC, PNCC, Meralco, and the two government-owned television stations will commence this year. The Department of Finance will put in place, within 100 days, a program to spin off or restructure the rest of the government corporations. Ngunit ang mga ospital ng pamahalaan ay kailanman ay hindi natin ibebenta. [Applause] At mananatiling susuportahan ng ating pamahalaan.
All dealings, contracts, and negotiations will be done with complete transparency and integrity, every step of the way. [Applause]
Any indication of anomaly, I will immediately cancel the sale.
Uulitin ko, isang balita lang tungkol sa katiwalian, ipatitigil ko ang anumang klase ng subasta. Kahit sino pa sila. [Applause]
I have ordered an inventory of all government lands titled to departments and bureaus and their transfer to the national government. I want my officials to keep out of the real estate business and stick to public service. [Applause]
But let us not forget that privatization is mainly an emergency response to an emergency situation.
It is therefore my intention to initiate institutional reform of the entire budget process. My administration has just completed its first three-year budget framework, which the national government will soon propose to Congress as our budget accord. In contrast to the current practice where only the executive decides on the initial list of programs and projects, the budget accord will involve both Congress and the executive in the selection of projects to be approved by the President. And the total of these expenditures cannot exceed predetermined, irrevocable ceilings over the three-year period. [Applause]
Sa panig po naman ng pananalapi, umaasa akong magtatagumpay ang action plan ng Department of Finance upang maging epektibo ang pangongolekta ng buwis.
The action plan of the Department of Finance will start with an asset census, intended to establish an up-to-date and reliable database on the net worth of all tax-paying Filipinos.
We will push for a tax amnesty that will give peace of mind to delinquent taxpayers and tax credits to honest ones. Pagkatapos ng tax amnesty, I will assure you that we will apply the full force of the law against tax evaders. [Applause]
Tinitiyak ko sa inyo na hindi lamang natin hahabulin ang mga tax evaders na ito kundi siguradong mapaparusahan, sino man sila. [Applause]
We will establish a large taxpayers unit at the BIR. We will suspend the implementation of certain BOI exemptions granted to companies under laws and executive orders that expired in 1997. [Applause]
The fiscal reforms forced upon us by the economic crisis will continue to serve us well even after the crisis is over. I will take this opportunity to establish fiscal discipline in the spending habits of government. Although we have to tolerate a certain amount of deficit this year, we will try as best as possible to pursue a balanced budget for the national government in the coming years. The consolidated deficit for the entire public sector will be limited to no more than 1 percent of the country’s GNP.
Makikinabang ang lahat sa mga gagawin nating ito: Hindi lamang ang pamahalaan, kundi ang karaniwang mamamayan na rin.
Sa larangan ng ating financial system, patuloy na igagalang ng aking administrasyon ang kalayaan ng ating Monetary Board at ng Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas.
Subali’t hindi kailangang magdusa ng lubos ang kalakalan sa patuloy na pagtaas ng interest rates.
Kakatigan ko ang pagbaba ng interest at ang pagpapabilis sa daloy ng pananalapi, lalo na sa mga maliliit na negosyo. Gayunpaman, titiyakin kong ang salapi ng mga government financial institution [GFI] ay hindi sosolohin ng mga iilang korporasyon.
Giant corporations and powerful groups have cornered a huge chunk of the resources of government banks, whose mandate is principally to help agriculture and small and medium enterprises.
This practice will be reversed. Sobra na ang kanilang pagsasamantala. These billionaires have pushed small borrowers to lending windows that charge much higher interest rates. From this time on, GFIs will truly, sincerely, service the common people’s needs. [Applause]
Ipinamalas din ng kasalukuyang krisis ang peligro ng labis na pag-asa sa mga pondong nagmumula sa labas, kaya’t kailangan nating pag-ibayuhin ang sarili nating pag-iipon, nang may sarili tayong pampuhunan sa ating mga proyekto.
Sa dako naman tayo ng agrikultura, na lubhang napabayaan, kaya’t ang food security ng 70 milyong Pilipino ay nasa bingit ng alanganin.
The monopoly of rice importation by the National Food Authority has not stabilized prices, nor has it broken the cartels. Two administrations have declared sugar a sunset industry, doomed to die. Maybe. All I know is that, sunset industry or not, I cannot leave three million families who depend on sugar in the dark, with nothing to eat after the sun goes down.
Marahil ang paglubog ng ating agrikultura ay dulot ng kulang na imprastruktura. Hindi sapat ang bilang ng mga daanan na nag-uugnay sa mga bukid at mga pamilihan.
Bakit nga ba magtatanim kung hindi mo naman maibebenta ang iyong inani?
We are condoning irrigation fees. Ibibigay natin ng libre ang patubig sa ating magsasaka. [Applause] At the same time, we will launch a full-scale program based on cost-effective irrigation technologies.
Kailangan nating gumawa ng 140,000 kilometro ng mga bagong daan. Magkakahalaga ito ng P484 billion.
Without graft and corruption, this will be money well spent. It could also jumpstart the economy.
Tungkol naman sa ating kapaligiran, ipapairal natin ang ganap na pagbabawal sa pagtotroso o total log ban. [Applause] Maglulunsad tayo ng bagong programa sa muling pagtatanim ng mga puno. But not like in the past when massive reforestation was another excuse for massive corruption.
Traffic tells us that we need more roads and we need to finish them faster. One reason for delay of roads and other projects is the issuance of temporary restraining orders or TROs. I will not interfere with the judiciary, but I urge the Supreme Court to remind judges of the lawyer’s oath to delay no man for money.
Masyado ng garapal ang bentahan ng temporary restraining order. [Applause]
Walang lakas ang mahihirap upang tulungan ang kanilang sarili, ngunit ngayon, kahit ang gobyerno ay kapos sa pondo. So we must strategize to maximize.
Dole-outs are out, but basic social services are only just and right. That means basic health care, basic nutrition, and useful education for those who want it but cannot afford it.
We will speed up the program to establish one science high school in every province. [Applause] We will give education subsidies straight to deserving students and teachers without passing through the schools. That way they can choose where to study and where to teach.
Ang lahat ng mga ito ay nangangailangan ng salapi. Sa mga susunod na hakbangin, kailangan lamang natin ang tapang at political will. Nilagdaan ko na ang executive order na lumilikha sa tinaguriang Presidential Task Force against Organized Crime. Bunga nito, katakut-takot na batikos ang ipinukol sa akin.
Isang tanong, isang sagot: Kontra ba tayo sa krimen, o sa mga lulmalaban sa krimen? The task force is what I think is needed to hit crime, and hit it hard so as to put it out—decisively. [Applause] Maybe there is a better way, but no one has shown me this. They only say that I am wrong but not how I can do it right and effectively.
Sawa na ako sa kanila. Pati na ang mamamayan, sawa na rin. Sawa na sa puro pamumulitika. Sawa na sa puro salita, ngunit wala namang nagagawa kundi laitin ang mga lumalaban sa krimen. Buo na ang aking pasiya. Tuloy ang presidential task force against the criminals.
I propose that Congress amends the Dangerous Drug Act to eliminate the possibility of probation for all offenders. Even if they say they are sorry. The only place for a drug dealer and the addict is together in jail.
I shall propose another controversial measure. I want to devolve greater administrative control over the Philippine National Police to the local government units. [Applause] I am sure I will get hit for this also. Perhaps there is a constitutional question here. But one thing is sure, I am not abusing power. What I am doing is sharing some of my power with the local executives over the national police.
Ang pulis na baon sa hirap ay hindi nalalayo sa tukso na mang-abuso. Pero hindi ako nagdududa na gagampanan nang tapat ng mga alagad ng batas ang kanilang tungkulin kahit na gaano pa silang kahirap.
Ngunit bakit pa natin pabibigatin ang kanilang kalagayan? Naniniwala ako na kapag sapat ang sahod ng ating mga alagad ng batas, higit na magiging propesyonal ang ating mga pulisya.
Sa krimen, ang sagot natin ay kaparusahan. Sa rebelyon, ang tugon natin ay negosasyon.
Sa mga nagsisialsa, ay tapat lamang ang pagnanasa na makamit ang pagbabago sa lipunan, tayo ay handang makipag-negosasyon.
Subali’t sa mga terorista, wala tayong panahon.
Sa mga kapatid nating Muslim, hinihiling ko ang pagkakataon na mabigyan ng katarungan ang napakaraming taon ng kapabayaan. Tigilan natin ang dahas, at pag-ibayuhin ang sandugong kapatiran. Samantalang ang karapatan ng ating mga kababaihan ay patuloy nating itataguyod.
As President, I inherit not only the problems but the responsibility to finish what my predecessors have started. That includes the resolution of ill-gotten wealth cases from the Marcos era. [Applause] I will do so. We have talked of settlements but we have not precluded continuing prosecution.
Yet these cases have gone on long enough. Therefore, I order the Presidential Commission on Good Government to go forward on all ill-gotten wealth cases with all the evidence it has taken 12 long years to collect.
No more delays.
One way or another, I want these cases to end in one year, in final judgments or acceptable settlements.
Pagkatapos ng 12 taon, siguro naman may katibayan na upang mabigyan ng katarungan ang sambayanang Pilipino. Ito ang maliwanag na halimbawa ng justice delayed, justice denied.
Sa dakong external security naman. Effective national defense requires not just modern weaponry but better fighting men. Before we spend on expensive hardware, let us have the right kind of soldiers. It is not weapons that win wars but the men who fight them.
Until we develop a credible military deterrent, we must depend on the goodwill of our neighbors, on our treaty commitments with the United States, and on the skills of our diplomats in conveying to everyone that we want only peace, stability, and a shared prosperity.
It is said that my stand as a senator against the U.S. Bases Treaty disqualifies me as President from endorsing the Visiting Forces Agreement with the United States.
On the contrary, because I stood up for the Philippine sovereignty in 1991, now as your President, I have the moral right to stand up for Philippine security today. [Applause]
Sa bahagi naman ng pamamahala, itinatag ang pamahalaan upang paglingkuran ang mga mamamayan—at hindi ang kanyang sarili. Kung tutuusin kailangan natin ng higit pang pamamahala—lalo na upang itaguyod ang kapakanan ng mga maralita.
Sa ngayon, labis-labis ang ating pamamahala, subalit kulang na kulang naman ang mga serbisyong pampubliko.
Pakikiusapan ko ang Kongreso na bigyan ako ng kapangyarihan para reorganisahin ang gobyerno upang ito ay maging matipid at masinop. The aim is not to change officials but to rationalize government operations. We are a small country, we should only have a small government. Not only on the national but also on the local level.
Tungkol naman sa ating electoral reforms, hindi lamang halalang mapayapa ang ating kailangan, kundi kampanyang hindi lubhang magastos. Hindi lamang karapatan ng mga mamamayang bumoto ang dapat natin tiyakin; dapat siguruhin natin na ang mga boto nila ay mabibilang.
Upang makamit ito, kailangan bigyan ang Komisyon sa Halalan ng higit pang kapangyarihan upang harangin at parusahan ang lahat ng uri ng pandaraya. Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na magpatibay ng batas upang gawing heinous crime ang anumang electoral fraud. [Applause] Kailangan matapos ang computerization program bago sumapit ang susunod na eleksiyon. Natitiyak kong marami pa tayong magagawa sa ikabubuti ng pangangasiwa ng pamahalaan—ngunit maaring kailangan pang baguhin ang ilang mga alituntunin ng saligang batas. Darating ang panahon ng pagbabago sa ating Saligang Batas.
Mga kagalang-galang ng kinatawan ng sambayanang Pilipino: Hayaan ninyong wakasan ko ang mensaheng ito sa pagsambit ng isang taimtim na pag-asa.
Ngayong taon—sa kabila ng mga mabibigat na suliranin—sumusulong pa rin ang ating ekonomiya.
This year, despite formidable odds, we still expect some economic growth. Our gross national product is targeted to expand this year by 2 to 3 percent. While other countries in the region have registered negative GNP, we continue to have positive growth—this, I would say, is a credit to my predecessor, Former President Ramos. [Applause] We believe we can keep inflation based on 1998 prices in the single digits, at around 9.5 percent.
To conclude, my aim is to help our country escape the recession. My solutions are obvious, my proposals may be commonplace, but they were never adapted before.
In sum, they are to spend wisely and less. And by austerity and hard work generate the means to cover the shortfalls of the past, so we can have a smooth runway for a final takeoff.
Perhaps by then, six years will have passed, and someone else will take over as pilot. I am honored enough to be elected to the position of the highest responsibility, power, and trust in the land.
I have neither pretensions nor further ambition, only the sincere desire to serve, to help the least of our people. [Applause] Kaya po ako’y humihingi sa inyo ng kaunting pag-unawa, kaunting panahon, kaunting pagtitiis alang-alang sa ating bayan, at higit sa lahat para sa ating nakakaraming mahihirap na mamamayan.
Naniniwala ako na kapag nagawa natin na tayo’y nagkaisa, tayo’y nagkasama-sama, lahat ng klaseng pagsubok ay malalampasan natin. Nandiyan din ang ating hamon; nandiyan din ang ating tagumpay.
Maraming, maraming salamat po. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

Second State of the Nation Address of His Excellency Joseph Ejercito Estrada President of the Philippines
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 26, 1999]
“A Poverty-Free Philippines”
I, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, President of the Republic of the Philippines, with the nation, the world, and God as my witness, do hereby reaffirm my unwavering commitment to democracy. [Applause]
I stand by my solemn oath to defend the Constitution. As President, I will always uphold freedom in all its various forms; including the freedom of speech, of the press, of worship, of assembly, and of choice. [Applause] None of these freedoms are under threat.
Those who fear the loss of freedom do not share my faith in the strength of our Constitution, in the sturdiness of our institutions, in the passion of our people to preserve their freedom, and in their determination and power to defend it. Freedom may have been lost before. It will never be lost again. [Applause] Our people will see to that. I as president will stake my own life on it. [Applause]
Yet may I remind our people that liberty without responsibility is license, that freedom does not confer the right to violate the law or the rights of others, that freedom without responsibility is the formula for chaos, anarchy, and lawlessness.
The paranoid will take that last statement as a hidden threat. The rest will see it as a self-evident principle, accepted throughout the ages, and needing neither apology nor defense. Yet, given a choice between freedom and restraint, I will choose to err on the side of freedom. [Applause]
To paraphrase Voltaire: I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. But that does not mean I waive the right to argue with you! That is as much my constitutional right as it is yours.
Let all doubts be erased. Democracy, freedom, and the Constitution are alive and well in this country. [Applause]
Now, to other issues.
Although I am blessed with many friends, I have no cronies. [Applause]
I have turned down, and will continue to turn down, all requests for a government bailout of financially strapped companies, as I did in the case of Philippine Airlines, owned by Mr. Lucio Tan. [Applause]
The sequestered shares of Mr. Eduardo Cojuangco Jr. in San Miguel Corporation are under litigation and will stay as such until the case is resolved. There is no deal involved here with Mr. Cojuangco.
The extradition process involving Mr. Mark Jimenez will proceed in accordance with the due process of law, without obstruction.
There are no secret deals with the Marcoses.
I hope this answers your immediate concerns.
Ngayon, handa na ba kayong makinig sa akin? [Applause]
Ako’y nagagalak ipahayag sa inyo na ang ating bansa ay nakaahon na sa krisis ng Asia.
Ito ang isa sa maraming dahilan kung bakit dapat natin ipagdiwang ang unang kaarawan ng aking administrasyon.
Sa aking inagurasyon sa Luneta noong ika-30 ng Hunyo 1998, mahigpit kong iginiit na “Huwag n’yo akong susubukan!” [Applause] Nguni’t ang sumubok sa akin ay hindi ang taong-bayan kundi ang matinding bagyo na tumama sa ating ekonomiya.
Nang ako’y hinirang na maging kapitan ng barko ng ating sambayanan, ito ay kasalukuyang palubog na sa maalong dagat ng Asian crisis. Sabi ko sa aking sarili: ang ganda naman ng timing ng aking pagsakay. Hinahampas ng hangin at alon ang barko. At lalong masama, kakaunti na lang ang gasolina ng kanyang tangke. Paano natin ngayon dadalhin ang barkong ito sa ligtas na lugar hanggang makalipas ang malupit na panahon?
Mabuti na lamang, ang aming team ng mga kilalang dalubhasa sa kanya-kanyang linya ay nagkaisa sa pagpapasya kung paano lulutasin ang mga problema na ating hinaharap noon. Sa pamamagitan ng aming pagtutulungan, pagsisikap, at mga tamang pamamalakad, napaayos namin ang paggalaw ng barko. Nang sumikat ang araw, ang karamihan ng mga ibang barko ay nakalubog pa rin at nagsisikap pang umahon, ngunit ang barko ng Pilipinas ay nakalutang na sa liwanag ng araw.
Ngayon, marami na ang nakakargang gasolina sa ating barkong Pilipinas, dahil nais nilang sumama sa ating paglakbay sa darating na milenio. Malayo na ang kaya nating maabot. Kaya tayo ay susulong na ngayon!
Today, I fulfill my Constitutional mandate to address Congress on the first day of its regular session. By tradition, I am to dwell on the State of the Nation.
Let me start with a sincere apology to all those who expected or wished to see me fail. I am sorry to disappoint them. [Applause]
I am pleased to report that our nation is rising, growing, and strengthening. This is in contrast to the situation I described to you last year, and which I vowed to reverse. Ako’y natutuwang ipahayag na ang ating bayan ay umaangat, umuunlad, at lumalakas. Ito ay kabaligtaran ng kalagayan ng ating ekonomiya na aking binigkas dito noong nakaraang taon. Nakaraan na ang krisis ng ekonomiya.
Last year, when I first addressed this august body, our nation was in an economic crisis. Today, we are out of it.
Last year, I told you that our aim was to help the country escape the recession. We did it.
In 1998, most of our Asian neighbors sank into recession. In contrast, our country managed a modest but positive growth of one-tenth of one percent [0.1%] in our gross national product [GNP]. However, our gross domestic product [GDP] dipped by one-half of one percent [0.5%] during the year. In the first quarter of this year, our GNP abruptly surged upward by 2% and our GDP by 1.2%. Last year, we were struggling to keep ourselves from sinking. Today, we are sailing towards the high seas again.
It is time once more to pay tribute to a special class of Filipinos: our overseas workers. They as a group kept our GNP growth at positive rates even during the worst of times. They continue to be our economic saviors.
Last year, I expressed my hope of keeping inflation at a single-digit rate. We did it.
In 1998, the inflation rate was at a full-year average of 9.7%. It improved further to a six-month average of 8.4% in the first half of 1999. In June alone, inflation was down to 5.8%. Inflation is a vicious enemy of the poor.
Last year, I said that without undermining the independence of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, we would support the lowering of interest rates. We did it.
In the past 12-month period alone, the benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rate dropped steeply from 14.9% on the first auction on July 6, 1998, to 8.4% last Monday. This is its lowest level in more than 12 years. Bank lending rates have also dropped to pre-crisis levels.
Last year, I lamented the devaluation of the peso as imposing burdens on our people. I inferred that we should strengthen our currency. We did it.
At the beginning of 1998, the peso plunged to an all-time low of P45.42 to $1. At the beginning of my administration, it was at P42.04. Since then, the peso has strengthened dramatically. It has stabilized within a range of P37 to P39 to the dollar. This was achieved largely by leaving the market alone. And the market responded with a show of confidence: it sent billions of dollars of loans, investments, and export orders to the Philippines. The Bangko Sentral intervened only occasionally to prevent wild swings and to forestall speculative attacks, not to set the trends or levels of the exchange rate.
Last year, I committed to more effective and efficient tax collection. We did it.
Despite the ravages of the Asian crisis on tax collections, total revenues amounted to P462 billion in 1998, of which tax revenues constituted P416 billion, or P4 billion higher than in 1997. For the first four months of 1999, BIR collections reached P126 billion, or 3.2% higher than in 1998. Customs collections amounted to P23.1 billion, and nontax revenues, P14.1 billion.
This does not mean that we are happy with our tax effort. We need to improve not only our collection performance but the tax structure itself, and hence our existing tax laws.
Last year, we found the government in a deeper fiscal hole than the public had been made to believe. We committed to reduce the government deficit. This time, we didn’t do it.
It is not that we failed. We deliberately shifted course.
At a time when the economy was threatened by recession, the previous administration had decided on a 25% across-the-board forced savings on the expenditures of the government. This was like administering the medicine for high blood pressure to a patient with low blood pressure. Lalong lulubha ang pasyente, at baka mamatay ng hindi oras. (That is why my favorite doctor, The First Lady, always makes sure that my blood pressure is normal, especially when I’m reading the newspapers.) [Laughter] [Applause]
We scrapped the forced cutbacks and did exactly the opposite. We not only ensured that public services would continue at adequate levels; we also engaged in various pump-priming. Our aim was not to save but to spend. This was to counteract the slowdown in private consumption and investment expenditures. In other words, to raise the country’s declining blood pressure rather than let it sink further.
Our logic was simple. A time of growth and threats of inflation calls for balanced budgets or surpluses to prevent further inflation. But a time of recession and deflation calls for budget deficits to jumpstart a recovery.
Thus, towards the end of 1998, we increased the budget deficit to P50 billion, or 1.8% of the GNP. For the first time, and for the first five months of 1999, we incurred, as planned, a deficit of P45.3 Billion, still within the 1999 programmed deficit of P68.4 billion (or 2.2% of target GNP). For the next two years, we intend to reduce our deficit to 1.1% and 0.4% of GNP, and eventually attain a balanced budget in the year 2002 and surpluses thereafter. In other words, I will not end my term with a deficit. [Applause]
One problem we faced was how to finance the deficit. Borrowing locally would have raised interest rates at a time when we wanted them to go down. Borrowing abroad was too costly. Monetary expansion would have triggered inflation and a run on the peso. Foreign exchange controls were untenable. Raising taxes or cutting government expenditures would have led to a deep recession.
It seemed like there was no way out. But we found one anyway. Substantial funds were located right under our noses—the Foreign Currency Deposit Units, or FCDUs—so we borrowed from them, on a short-term basis, at relatively low cost.
As a result, we brought down interest rates. We brought down the inflation rate. And we strengthened the peso. Experts say these all cannot happen at the same time because they are inconsistent with one another. But we did it. And we emerged out of the regional crisis ahead of most of our neighbors.
I narrate all these “inside stories” to make a point. Those who make a career and a business out of hitting me are saying that the improvement in the country’s economic performance was due to pure luck, to good weather, or to anything but Erap. Tsamba lang daw. Sa madali’t salita, kung gumaganda ang takbo ng ekonomiya, walang kinalaman si Erap. Ngunit kung bumagsak ang ekonomiya, kasalanan ni Erap. Mali naman yata iyan. Our recovery was due to the innovative way we analyzed situations and made bold decisions.
Our success was the result of effective governance. It was a matter of having the right policies, being supported by competent and dedicated cabinet members, respecting the freedom of the market, managing and budgeting our resources right, and acting quickly before the danger grew or the opportunity disappeared.
As a prominent Filipino economist, Dr. Bernardo Villegas, recently wrote—and I quote—”The economic team of the present administration during its first year has been superior in cohesiveness, effectiveness, and clarity in purpose when compared to the equivalent teams during the first years of [the previous administrations] … President Estrada’s first economic team is among the best in Asia.” [End of quote]
Effective governance by a team-powered administration also explains the rapid recovery of the country’s international credit standing. I am sure you know the definition of a banker: He is a person who lends you his umbrella when it stops raining. Credit markets are even more jittery.
So when the global market gobbles up $1.2 billion worth of the Republic of the Philippines Global Bonds for budget support, from the first country to float such an issue after the Asian crisis; and when the market buys up the $400 million of Bangko Sentral bonds issued for reserve management purposes; and when the Eurobond flotation of the national government raises $383 million—the world believes that in the Philippines, it has stopped raining. We are getting a shower of umbrellas!
This is not to mention the billions of dollars of inflows in medium- and long-term loans from bilateral sources, banks, and financial institutions; from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank; from Japan’s Export-Import Bank and Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund; and from the International Monetary Fund, among others.
Isa pang tanda ng pagbangon ng ating ekonomiya ay ang pagbaba ng unemployment rate mula 13.3% noong Abril nang nakaraang taon hanggang 11.8% nitong nakaraang Abril dahil sa 1.6 million bagong trabahong nalika. Gagawin namin ang lahat para ibaba ang unemployment rate sa less than 10% sa susunod na taon at sa around 6.7% bago magtapos ang aking administrasyon. [Applause] Ang ating target ay makalikha nang mula sa 6 million hanggang 6.4 million trabaho sa buong panahon ng akng panunungkulan. [Applause]
In the meantime, our exports are zooming up at double-digit rates, our balance of current accounts are in surplus, and our gross international reserves are at all-time highs, currently amounting to $14 billion.
With all these developments, it is no wonder that in the space of only one year, the other Asian countries and, indeed, much of the world, have come to recognize the presidency of the Philippines as among the leaders of the region. This is indeed a long way from the skepticism that greeted this presidency when it began. In APEC, in ASEAN, and in other regional and international forums, the current leadership of the Philippines enjoys a high level of respect. Our international prestige is on the rise. The dramatic rebound in the stock market is a strong indication of confidence. And the people, according to the latest surveys, give the president a 77.6% approval rating.
The heads of the IMF and the World Bank also have had good words to say. Mr. James Wolfensohn, President of the World Bank, said—and I quote—”What is clear is the Philippine situation is vastly different from Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia … I think you all know you are weakened far less than anyone else in the region with the exception of Singapore.” End of quote. And Mr. Michel Camdessus, managing director of the IMF, said he considered the Philippines as a model for countries in the ASEAN region.
Only last Thursday, the IMF Executive Board completed the fourth review under our standby arrangement. This will now allow us to draw about $214 million, which will further increase our gross international reserves. The IMF executive directors also praised the Bangko Sentral, headed by Governor Gabriel Singson, for the successful implementation of monetary policy through the turbulence of the past two years.
It is ironic that while foreign experts and the foreign press give good reviews of our performance, and while investors pour money into our economy, some quarters in our local media are undermining confidence in our country. Samantalang ang mga dayuhang ekonomista at manunulat ay pinupuri ang pag-ahon ng ating ekonomiya, ang ilan naman sa ating mga peryodista ay siyang unang sumisira dito ng walang basehan.
In the past year, the main imperative that faced us was to survive the crisis. Now, we turn to pursuing our vision.
There are those, in fact, who say that we have no vision. They claim, for example, that we have no programs to fight poverty: the central pledge of my campaign. they are wrong. It is not the government that is lacking in programs. It is our critics who are lacking in perception. it is not I who has no vision. It is they who have no insight.
I consider poverty an intolerable social shame. It cries out not for marginal attention but for a total approach. For me, the war on poverty is not just a policy but a passion. I deplore the fact that the past economic programs of this country were mostly upside-down. Baligtad. They aimed at developing the apex and neglected the base.
My own belief is the opposite. Uplifting the rich leaves the poor behind. But uplifting the poor lifts everyone, including the rich.
Let me make this clear. My vision is not just the alleviation of poverty but its ultimate eradication. Alleviation is temporary. Eradication is permanent. Alleviation is limited. Eradication is total. The proper response to the problem of poverty is not superficial treatment but total structural change. Hindi maaring puksain ang kahirapan sa pamamagitan ng patapal-tapal at papahid-pahid lamang. Kailangan ay baguhin ang buong sistema.
I realize that “eradication” is unattainable in real life. But getting as close to it as possible is worth the effort. It is true that Jesus Christ said: “The poor you will always have with you,” but he did not say they had to be the majority. My vision is to drive poverty away from the center and into the periphery of our concerns, to make it a marginal rather than a mainstream problem.
Hence, our war on poverty is not just one program of government. It is the overriding business of the government itself. It is built into and embedded in our total economic and social programs. It defines and drives the substance, the content, and the heart and soul of our entire strategy of government.
Ang ating kampanya laban sa kahirapan ay hindi isang programa lamang ng pamahalaan. Ito ang sentro ng patakaran at pagkilos ng pamahalaan. Nakatatak ito sa kabuuan ng bawat programang pangkabuhayan at panlipunan. Ito ang magbibigay-buhay at lakas sa diwa at puso ng pagkilos at pamamalakad ng pamahalaan.
It is essential for our war on poverty that the economy develop in general, but this is not enough. It is also important that development efforts be redirected towards the poor, towards the base of our society. In my 30 years of public service, I have always decided for the greater good of the greatest number. With this conviction, I can never go wrong.
For example, our war on poverty is in the fundamental and strategic shift of focus of the government towards agriculture and the development of the rural areas, where two-thirds of our poor people live.
Ang ating pagkilos para maging moderno ang ating agrikultura—para tumaas ang ani ng ating mga bukirin at pangingisda at dumami ang mga industriya sa kanayunan—ay isang paraang hindi pa nasubukang gawin ng alin mang administrasyon. Nakapaloob dito ang paglalaan ng sapat na pondo para sa produksiyon ng pagkain, food security, irigasyon, farm-to-market roads, at postharvest facilities. Nitong nakaraang taon, nabigyan natin ng patubig ang mahigit 20,000 ektarya ng lupa at nakapagtayo tayo ng 250 kilometro ng farm-to-market roads. Sisiguruhin nating makakuha ng tulong pinansyal ang ating mga magsasaka, mangingisda, at maliliit na negosyante. Palalawakin natin ang mga lupang sakop ng irigasyon mula 47.2% noong 1998 hanggang 63% sa taong 2004.
This past year, we laid the foundation for the full implementation of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act. This law aims at transforming our agriculture and fisheries into technologically advanced and globally competitive sectors. Recently, I ordered that the importation of equipment, machinery, fertilizers, and other inputs of agriculture be allowed at zero tariff, as authorized by this law. [Applause] This coming year, our proposed budget will provide a P21.8 billion fund to support the implementation of this act.
Our war on poverty is also in the emphasis on expanding the linkages between farms and markets, and between rural and urban areas, through roads, power, transport, telecommunications, and other infrastructure. Last year, we built or upgraded 582 kilometers of roads and 10,069 lineal meters of bridges. We provided electricity to 1,221 barangays. We installed 165,000 new telephone lines. Our target is to see 100% of our national arterial roads paved and 100% of our bridges made permanent by the end of my term. We will upgrade our ports to international standards, and develop 36 feeder ports.
Our war on poverty is in the acceleration of the land redistribution processes under the agrarian reform program. We distributed more than 266,000 hectares of land to 175,000 landless farmers, including land owned by the traditional rural elite. [Applause]
Our war on poverty is in the restructuring of our health programs to lower the price of medicines and to provide preferential attention to the indigents.
It is also in the highly augmented flow of budgetary funds to the local government units [LGUs]. As a single recipient unit, LGUs will get a total of P131.2 billion, or 20.1%, of the P651 billion budget we will propose.
Our war on poverty is in the massive portion of our budget—amounting to P118 billion for the year 2000—that we give to education and to the programs we are undertaking to meet our increasing need for classrooms, desks, books, and teachers. Our longer-term aim is to increase the overall standards of excellence of our entire educational system.
Our war on poverty is in our initiatives to provide more resources for socialized housing for the poor. From July 1998 to March 1999, we provided 127,886 units of housing assistance which benefited some 74,000 households. We intend to provide decent housing for our teachers, policemen, and soldiers.
Our war on poverty is in the provision of more resources and revitalized programs to uplift and improve the welfare of women, the youth, the indigenous communities, the disabled, and the elderly, and other disadvantaged sectors of our society.
Our war on poverty is in our program to moderate the growth of the population, which is presently the highest in Southeast Asia. It is in our efforts to protect the environment to ensure that our development is sustainable. One landmark achievement here is the passage by Congress of the Clean Air Act.
Our war on poverty is invading even the capital market. It is in the issuance of small-denominated government bonds that allow small savers to contribute to national development while earning interest at higher rates than the banks would pay them.
We will propose certain changes in our tax laws to make our financial markets more efficient and to bring down transaction costs. The documentary stamp tax on quick-turnover transactions will be abolished. The gross receipts tax on banks and financial institutions will be removed to reduce intermediation costs. And the availment of write-offs on loan loss reserves will be accelerated.
Our war on poverty is particularly intense in the obsessive efforts of the government to promote and encourage investments, both domestic and foreign. Here, another basic pro-poor shift is taking place. We are reorienting our preferences towards industries, enterprises, and technologies that employ people as against those that require capital. This is only logical, considering that we are a labor-abundant and a capital-short country. Small- and medium-scale industries will take centerstage. One of our important thrusts is a program called DRIVE, or Developing Rural Industries and Village Enterprises.
All these shifts will take place in a free market environment. all investments in industries, whether large or small, upstream or downstream, capital- or labor-intensive, will be welcome. But special attention will be placed on “unblocking” investments in small- and medium-scale industries, especially in the rural areas. There are many obstacles in our laws and in our landscape that impede the spontaneous flow of investments and technology into these industries. These obstacles will be removed by programs that will open up and make markets more efficient: whether by legislation, by policy and regulation revamps, by focused infrastructure construction, or by other means.
Investments create jobs. And jobs provide both income and dignity. They are the decisive eliminators of poverty.
Our war on poverty is in our programs to enable our industries to achieve global competitiveness. We will transform the power sector to a market-based, competitive industry in order to lower the costs of power. The Omnibus Power Bill is necessary to achieve this. We will exploit our competitive advantage in high-tech industries. Our science and technology policies are being reoriented towards satisfying the needs of the underprivileged.
Let us face up to the fact that certain provisions in our present Constitution are obsolete and serve as deterrents to our global competitiveness. In the race with the rest of the world market to the coming millennium, we cannot afford to let our Constitution bind our feet. [Applause]
It is now time for us to identify which parts need to be improved. Some are economic; they should be made effective as soon as possible. Some are political; they should be rewritten in a way that will not allow the incumbent officials to benefit from them. [Applause] Changing the Constitution is not about extending the terms of office of incumbents.
But let us not allow our paranoid fears to block the convening of an appropriate assembly or convention to rewrite our charter. Let us not prejudge its outcome. Our citizens can always make their voices heard during the amendment process. And ultimately, they will exercise the power, in a plebiscite, to ratify the new charter or to reject it.
Our Constitution must be made to adapt to the dynamics and imperatives of global realities.
Even our relationships with foreign lands are linked to developing our hinterlands. Our foreign policy is based on three pillars: the preservation of our territorial integrity and national security, the promotion of development through economic diplomacy, and the protection of the rights and welfare of our overseas nationals. Our participation, and leadership roles, in ASEAN, APEC, ASEM, the UN, and other forums are aimed at promoting stability, peace, free and fair trade, and other beneficial arrangements for the country, the region, and the world.
Our war on poverty is good economics. Its success will benefit the middle and upper classes as well. The more incomes the poor earn, the greater the domestic market for business. The more capable the poor are, the greater the supply of manpower needed by business.
Gaya ng sinabi ko kanina, kung iaangat natin ang mayayaman, ang mahihirap ay maiiwan. Ngunit kung iaangat natin ang mahihirap, ang lahat ay aangat.
I do not presume that we will reduce poverty during my term from a major to a marginal problem. But we do aspire to reduce it substantially: from an incidence of over 32% today to a range of 25% to 28% by 2004. In other words, we seek to lift more than 3.9 million Filipinos out of poverty during my term. We also hope to lay the foundations and launch the initiatives that will make the process irreversible even beyond my term.
However, as eradication proceeds, alleviation continues. As the cancer is being removed, its pains are being relieved. Alleviation takes many forms, including social welfare services, assistance for street children, senior citizens welfare programs, relief from disasters, resettlements, and help for the disabled and the disadvantaged.
Isa pang bahagi ng ating kampanya laban sa kahirapan ay ang isaayos ang pamamalakad ng pamahalaan. Ang hangad natin ay mabawasan ang aksaya at madagdagan ang serbisyong tinatanggap ng ating mga mamamayan. Unang-una na rito ang pagsugpo sa graft and corruption. Ang bawat pisong nawawala sa anomalya ay pisong ninanakaw mula sa mahihirap. Ninanakaw ng mga nagsasamantala ang mga pakinabang na sana’y mapupunta sa mga taongbayan tulad ng mas maraming eskwelahan, mas maraming libro, mas maraming kalye, mas murang gamot, at mas maraming pasilidad sa pag-utang.
It is also time to put the so-called Marcos wealth in the service of the economy, of the people, and particularly of the poor. Twelve years are enough time to know the difference between the ideal and the feasible. It is also more than enough time to place evidence entirely out of reach of even the most diligent discovery efforts.
We do not know the size of the Marcos wealth. And no judgment has ever been rendered that any of it is ill-gotten. Shall we wait forever?
The more we wait, the more the returns on their wealth accrue to the Marcoses and the foreign banks, and none to the Filipino people. The earlier we acquire a substantial part of it, the sooner the returns accrue to the country.
Any transfers of the Marcos wealth will augment the country’s resources for fighting poverty.
Ang isa pang balakid sa digmaan laban sa karalitaan, at sa kaunlaran ng buong bayan, ay ang rebelyon ng ilan sa ating mga kababayan. Sila’y matagal nang iniwan ng kanilang mga lider upang magpasarap sa ibang bansa, at doon nila tinutulak ang “insurgency by remote control.”
Ako’y nakikiusap sa mga rebeldeng naiwan dito. Hindi tayo magkalaban. Kung ang layunin ninyo ay ang kapakanan ng masa, heto ang masasabi ko sa inyo: Laging kasama ninyo si Erap sa pagmamalasakit sa masa. Kailanman ay hindi ko kayo iiwanan. Kaya magsamasama na tayo.
Hinahangad namin ang kapayapaan. Sa halip ng pag-uusap sa ibang bansa o “neutral territory,” ilagay natin ang peace process sa tamang lugar: sa community level. The Local Peace Forum, where established, are addressing directly the issues and concerns on the ground which are considered the causes of insurgency.
Ngunit mabuti na ring maliwanag ang usapan. Kuwentas klaras. Kakaunti na lang ang panahon at pasiyensiya na nalalabi sa pagdadada. Isuko na ninyo ang inyong armas. Bumalik na kayo sa buklod ng batas at ng ating lipunan, At dito tayo mag-usap ng masinsinan, bilang magkakapatid, walang sandata sa kamay, walang tutukan ng baril.
Our people overwhelmingly support our constitutional system and our functioning democracy. No insurgency of any color has the legal, political, or moral right to seek to bring it down.
This government was elected by the people. It enjoys their support. Your rebellion does not. And this government was not elected to compromise the sovereignty of this Republic, not in substance, not in symbol, not ever.
If you wish to run the government, seek the people’s mandate. If you have any grievances against the government or against society, seek your redress within the law. You have a right to your beliefs, but you cannot justify your belligerence.
Peace we offer to you, but appeasement, never. It is the weak that offers appeasement to the strong, not vice versa. Do not doubt our resolve. We will welcome you back at any time. But we will give your rebellion no air to breathe, no space to move, no time to prosper. If you accept peace, you will have it. If you do not, we will force it anyway.
The rebellion, we must crush. [Applause] The rebels, we must save, unless they persist in their rebellion. Those who refuse to be saved will invite the full force of our laws and the full might of our forces.
Hindi binebeybi ang rebelyon. Pinipisa. [Laughter] [Applause] Kaya, huwag n’yo kaming hamunin!
Gayon din ang masasabi ko tungkol sa krimen at mga salarin. Hindi nilalambing ang krimen. Dinudurog. Hindi kinukupkop ang kriminal. Pinaparusahan. Lalung-lalo na iyong mga nagtutulak ng bawal na gamot sa ating mga kababayan. [Applause] Sitenta porsiyento ng krimen ay nagmumula sa paggamit ng droga. I am happy to report, however, that our efforts at fighting crime have resulted in remarkable reductions in criminal activity, thanks to the vigilance of our crime-fighting agencies at all levels. still, one crime committed is one crime too many.
Our initiatives to bring about stability in Mindanao are directly related to poverty elimination. We will build up Mindanao as the country’s food basket. [Applause] But we can only succeed if an environment of political tranquility is established there. The proposed plebiscite on the expansion of the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao and the subsequent elections are large steps towards stability in that all-important island.
To assure internal and external security, and to preserve the environment of stability the country needs to prosper, we will pursue the 15-year modernization program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. [Applause] We intend to make our military and police forces among the most modern in the region.
That is the vision. That is the strategy. But as one famous architect said, “god is in the details.” The concrete specifics that will make our vision real are contained in the array of plans, programs, and projects to be implemented in the next five years by various government departments, agencies, and corporations, and by local government units.
I cannot in this address enumerate them all. They will be presented in more detail, first, in our forthcoming “Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 1999 to 2004,” which we will call “Angat Pinoy 2004”; second, in the P621 billion budget for the year 2000, which I am submitting to Congress today; and third, in our legislative agenda. The list of our proposed bills will also be submitted to Congress today, together with the printed version of this address.
I earnestly ask our legislators to support us by passing these bills, and by harmonizing every appropriations act they will pass with “Angat Pinoy 2004.”
Our vision is coherent and clear. I wonder why some observers fail to perceive it. Please don’t get shocked if I quote from the scriptures; I believe the answer is there—and I quote: “They look but do not see, and hear but do not listen.” End of quote. By the way, that was from Matthew.
The English author, George Moore, was right when he said—and I quote—”The lot of critics is to be remembered by what they failed to understand.” End of quote.
We have gone a long way, but with the help of many. The local government units at all levels are indispensable partners in the strengthening of our economy and our society. The nongovernmental organizations and people’s organizations are helping to deepen and expand the foundations of our development on the ground. The private sector—whether engaged in business, education, health, and other forms of services—have been a principal source of energy for our survival, recovery, and growth.
And of course, I wish to express my appreciation for the contribution and support of Congress. I can only hope that the productivity of the legislative process will multiply in this coming session. Your powers and ours may be separate, as mandated by the Constitution, but our concern for our people should converge.
To sum up: We have emerged from the Asian crisis. We are now in pursuit of our vision of a prosperous and a poverty-free Philippines. The future is for us to shape.
The conditions are positive. Our exports are surging up. Our rice and corn harvests are bountiful. Our banking system is among the strongest in Asia. The peso is stable. Interest rates are low and inflation is low. The figures for the second quarter are not yet out, but I am confident that our GNP will grow by at least 2.4% and our GDP by at least 2%.
Our markets are freer, our institutions stronger, our policies more supportive of growth, our people better prepared than ever.
We are now poised to fly and—as we used to say in the old school—fly high. The skies are there for us to conquer. All we need is to unite.
As to those who continue to distract me from pursuing my vision, I take my cue from Abraham Lincoln, who said—and I quote—”If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how, the very best I can, and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what’s said against me won’t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten angels swearing I was right would make no difference.” End of quote.
According to the surveys, millions of Filipinos are saying I am right. Between Lincoln’s ten angels and the millions of my own countrymen, I choose to believe my countrymen. [Applause]
Sa ngayon, ang ating ekonomiya ay unti-unti nang nakakaahon. Ngunit marami pang hamon ang hinaharap ng ating bansa ngayon at sa darating na siglo. Malawak at malalim ang mga programang dapat natin ipatupad upang maiangat sa kahirapan ang karamihan sa ating mga kababayan.
Alam ko na sa bawat kilos at hakbang na aking gagawin ay magiging matindi ang mga paninira, ang mga batikos, ang mga insulto, at mga paratang. Ngunit ang isasagot ko sa kanila ay marangal at matapat na paninilbihan dahil ang aking pakikinggan ay ang daing ng higit na nakakarami, at hindi ang ingay ng iilang may pansariling interes. [Applause] Para sa akin, ito ang mabigat na hamon sapagka’t ang kapalit nito ay ang kinabukasan ng ating lipunan.
Muli, ako’y nananawagan sa lahat ng ating mga kababayan na tayo ay magkaisa at magsikap para sa ating kaunlaran, katahimikan, at magandang kinabukasan.
Maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat! [Applause] [Standing ovation]

Third State of the Nation AddressofHis Excellency Joseph Ejercito EstradaTo the Congress of the Philippines
[Delivered at Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, July 24, 2000]
“Toward New Beginnings”
Thank you very much.
Our Honorable Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; Honorable Senate President Franklin Drilon; Honorable House Speaker Manuel Villar Jr.; Honorable Supreme Court Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr.; Former President Fidel V. Ramos; excellencies from the diplomatic corps led by Dean of the Diplomatic Corps Archbishop Antonio Franco; our Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Angelo T. Reyes and commanding generals of the Armed Forces major services; honorable members of the 11th Congress; honorable members of the Cabinet; honorable local executives; other distinguished guests; my coworkers in government; First Lady Dra. Loi; mga minamahal kong mga kababayan:
This is the first opening session of Congress and my first State of the Nation Address to be held in the third millennium and in the 21st century. It is obviously an auspicious occasion for new beginnings.
It should be a new beginning for Mindanao, a new beginning for the economy, a new beginning for integrity in government, and a new beginning for the country. It will also be a new beginning for the presidency.
To begin with, we will write a new history for Mindanao. We will rectify centuries of historical wrongs committed by successive colonial powers, and decades of inequity committed by successive Philippine governments.
Mindanao has traditionally been called the Land of Promise. This romantic name has always been a one-way affair. The rest of the country has always expected Mindanao to fulfill its promises to them. It is now time for the rest of the country to fulfill its promises to Mindanao. [Applause]  We should now convert Mindanao into the Land of Fulfillment.
Let us not forget that Mindanao is an integral and organic part of the Philippines. It has been so for the past four and a half centuries. It is so today, it will be so forever.
This is why the government had to neutralize the attempt of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front [MILF] to amputate the southern parts of the country away from the organic whole and to convert them into an independent Muslim state. They were winning their war of territorial encroachment simply because the previous administration refused to fight, pretending that it wasn’t happening. In fact, the MILF had already occupied and hoisted their flag over large territories in Mindanao—in at least 46 camps—under the nose of the preceding administration, which was either naive enough to tolerate them or too timid to stop them.
In contrast, my government was decisive enough to expel them. As President, I could not just stand by while the rebels ate up more and more of the country’s territory they were not elected to govern. When I took office, I swore to preserve and defend the Constitution. It was my solemn duty under that Constitution to repel the armed rebellion and to defend the sovereignty and integrity of this republic. [Applause]
The MILF could not be talked out of their position, whether territorial or ideological. They said that their goal of secession was nonnegotiable. Well, neither is the sovereignty and integrity of the republic. No one can challenge that proposition by force of arms and get away with it.
It would have been quieter if the conflict could be resolved by an exchange of words rather than by an exchange of fire. But whenever words were tried in the past, in the name of so-called peace but which in reality was appeasement, the rebels simply used the peace talks as an opportunity for arms buildup, for troop recruitment and training, for deployment, for territorial consolidation, and for enlarging their threat to the republic.
There would have been a larger space for tolerance if they had pushed their cause in the open marketplace for ideas. But instead, they built up an army and used their firepower to force their separatist aims on our unwilling people.
True to form, the MILF took advantage of the 1997 ceasefire to commit at least 227 violations. These include the kidnapping of Father Luciano Benedetti in September 1998; the occupying and setting on fire of the municipal hall of Talayan, Maguindanao; the takeover of the Kauswagan Municipal Hall; the bombing of the Lady of Mediatrix boat at Ozamiz City; and the takeover of the Narciso Ramos Highway. By doing so, they inflicted severe damage on the country’s image abroad, and scared much-needed investments away.
The numerous camps they maintained were not Boy Scout camps. They were staging areas and launching pads for expanding the MILF rebellion further. These military camps were not under the command and control of the government of the Republic of the Philippines. They owed their allegiance elsewhere.
Given all these, plus the unabated murders, terrorism, abuses, extortion, bombings, illegal control of buildings and public highways, and other atrocities committed by the rebels in the pursuit of their secessionist aims, the government was faced with two choices. One was to play the sucker, keep talkng and let the problems grow until the republic was in real mortal danger. The other was to meet force with force. An armed rebellion demanded an armed response. The sitting-duck strategy has never been known to work well … for the duck.
In order to ensure permanent peace in the future, we had to demolish the rebels’ apparatus for making war. Moreover, abstention from military action would have meant political abdication.
In effect, we did not choose the military option. It was forced upon us. But we used it. And we succeeded.
The retaking of these territories was not just a symbolic victory but a substantive one. We upheld the constitutional principle that the Philippines is one state, one republic, with one government, one military answerable to one civilian Commander in Chief, under one Constitution and one flag, in one undivided territory. That is what it is now. That is what it will be forever.
Ang buong bansa ay nagpupugay sa kagitingan ng mga opisyal at mga kawani ng ating Sandatahang Lakas ng Pilipinas sa pamumuno ng ating kalihim ng Department of National Defense at ng ating Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. Kasama ng ating mga field commanders, tinupad nila ng buong katapatan at katapangan ang kanilang tungkulin sa ating pagsakop ng mga kampo ng MILF. Let the whole country salute the Filipino soldiers who valiantly and bravely fought the rebels in defense of the sovereignty, integrity, and honor of the Republic of the Philippines. [Applause] Let the whole country pay tribute, in particular, to those who gave up their lives or were injured fighting to preserve the unity of their motherland. Sila ay nakadagdag sa hanay ng ating mga bagong bayani.
Ngunit ang buong lipunan ay nakikiramay din sa mga mahal sa buhay ng mga nasawi, sa hanay ng dalawang puwersa, sibilyan man o mga sundalo. Nakikidalamhati tayo doon sa mga nasaktan at napinsala ng kaguluhang ito.
Now that we have won the war, it is time to win the peace. Toward this end, the government has adopted a four-point strategy in approaching the Mindanao question from hereon.

The first is to restore and maintain peace in Mindanao—because without peace, there can be no development.
The second is to develop Mindanao—because without development, there can be no peace.
The third is to continue seeking peace talks with the MILF within the framework of the Constitution—because a peace agreed upon in good faith is preferable to a peace enforced by force of arms.
And the fourth is to continue with the implementation of the peace agreement between the government and the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF]—because that is our commitment to our countrymen and to the international community.

I now invite the MILF into a brotherly embrace of peace. Let us walk away from the battlefield and into the conference room. But we must do so in good faith. You must talk peace with us, not talk while preparing for war.
And you must accept our conditions. You must drop secession, drop your criminal activities, and drop your arms.
These are not requests but demands. They are not proposals but premises. We can talk about when, where, and how, but not about whether or not. We can be flexible on timetables and methods, but not about principles.
The reasons for each demand should be obvious. I will briefly discuss them in reverse order.
You must drop your weapons because outside of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the authorized police forces, no group whatsoever has any right to maintain an armed force or military camps within the sovereign territory of this republic.
Secession by itself is a mere ideology, but if backed by armed force, it becomes a rebellion. A secessionist can only argue, but a rebel can kill. The government has no choice but to disarm the rebel—except for duly licensed personal firearms.
You must drop all your criminal activities because terrorism, bombings, and violence have no place in a civilized society. Criminals have no place in a negotiating table. Their place is in jail.
Most of all, you must drop your secessionist goals. We do not ask that you respect and recognize the sovereignty of the republic. We demand that you do.
May I give the MILF some unsolicited advice. Secession in the Philippines is an impossible dream. There simply is no space in our geography, in our demographics, and in all our national mentality for forcibly carving another state out of the present Philippine territory. For that reason, the foreign models you invoke, like East Timor, will not work for you.
Please bear in mind that you are neither the sole occupants nor even the majority in the lands you wish to carve out to convert into your own state. There are whole Filipino populations in Mindanao—Muslims, Christians, and Lumad—who do not want their territories and their residences disturbed. Not even the majority of the Muslim population shares your separatist views nor the violent means you employ to attain them. The overriding passion of the people of Mindanao is for peace.
And the international community as a whole will neither support nor sympathize with secession. In fact, we deeply appreciate the statement of the secretary general of the Organization of Islamic Conference [OIC], encouraging Muslim minorities in nonmember states, and I quote:
To contribute effectively to the progress of the countries they live in and to respect their sovereignty and laws. 
Unquote.
Secession as a dream is also out of tune with history. If there is one lesson that historical evolution has taught us, it is this: That diversity is a cause for celebration, not segregation; that cultural cross-breeding leads to strength while in-breeding leads to weakness; and that cultural identities are enriched by interaction and impoverished by isolation. Some of the most glorious creations and achievements of civilization are the products of the historical confluences between Islam and Christianity.
What we should strive for is not just peaceful coexistence but interactive harmony and constructive interdependence.
We cannot negotiate over secession. The sovereignty and the integrity of the republic are not available for compromise or trade—not even for the sake of peace. Any peace won by bartering any portion of our sovereignty is an immoral peace.
We cannot talk about secession. But we can talk about a new beginning for Mindanao.
In fact, if you are bold enough for it, we can talk about a different war, a bigger war that needs to be fought. I do not mean the guerrilla warfare that you appear to have shifted to. I hope you stop—for the sake of the people, especially the poor, who will suffer the most from continued hostilities. But if you decide to engage us further, we are ready for you. If you can shift strategies and tactics, so can we.
When I talk of another war, I mean the war to correct historical wrongs, which left a sad legacy of poverty and social injustice to Mindanao. This is the war that all of us, including ex-rebels, should fight together.
Fighting the rebellion is one thing. It takes the military to do it. But fighting the root causes of rebellion is another. It will take the whole society to do it.
We can talk about the possibility of amnesty. I ask the MILF leaders to lead your followers in walking with us along the path of peace. On the other hand, I invite the MILF followers to walk with us in peace even if your leaders won’t. Instead of the lives of hunted fugitives, you can now live the lives of peaceful farmers, fishermen, factory workers, merchants, entrepreneurs, or civil servants, or even soldiers or policemen. In short, we can talk about you reintegration into our society.
We can also talk about autonomy. On this subject, we are willing to be creative and to explore a wide range of possibilities, including radical changes in our political structure. I urge that we jointly envision and create a new order for Mindanao, which will restructure the governance, the economy, and the social environment of that island, with all its beauty and diversity.
We will convert Mindanao into the main food basket of the Philippines, into an agricultural paradise, and into a booming manufacturing base. Camp Abubakar, where the soldiers proudly raised the Philippine flag, will be developed into a special economic zone.
One thing I must emphasize, however, autonomy does not confer immunity or exemption from good governance, transparency, and accountability, particularly in the use of public funds.
The government has been providing full development support for Mindanao. From 1996, when the peace agreement was signed, up to 1999, the government poured in more than P32 billion for socioeconomic development programs into the special zone of peace and development [SZOPAD] comprising 14 provinces, as well as for the support and strengthening of the political institutions in the Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao [ARMM].
But to move both the peace process and the development of Mindanao forward faster, I urge Congress to pass the bill amending the ARMM Organic Act and the bill granting special powers to enable the fast-track of development of Mindanao.
On the matter of the Abu Sayyaf, we are all happy that some hostages have been released. I wish to give assurance that the primary concern of the government is the safe release of the hostages.
Contrary to rebel propaganda, our fight is not against Muslims at all. They are all our brothers. Our fight is against rebels and other outlaws, regardless of their religion.
Thus, I wish to send a message to all Muslim Filipinos, the majority of whom share a passion for peace and renounce the separatist rebellion.
My Muslim brothers: We worship the same God—the God of Abraham and Moses. You call him by his Arabic name, Allah, which in Filipino simply means Ang Diyos and in English, God. Is He on your side or ours? Maybe neither. He is on the side of peace, and therefore on both our sides. The government invoked the Constitution when it rolled back the rebellion. Let us now invoke our common God as we build the structures of peace.
As we embark on a new beginning in Mindanao, we shall also launch a new beginning for integrity in government.
In my address to you last year, I said: “Hindi binebeybi and rebelyon. Pinipisa. Iyan ay aking tinupad.”
More recently, I also said: “I offer peace to those who want peace. But I promise defeat to those who want war. Iyan ay tinupad ko rin.” [Applause]
I remind you of these statements because from the rebellion, I am shifting the war towards another enemy: graft and corruption.
Ito ang pangako ko sa inyo: Ito ay tutuparin ko rin. [Applause]
Ang aking susunod na digmaan ay laban sa mga tiwali sa pamahalaan at sa mga tao ng pribadong sektor na nakikipagsabwatan sa kanila.
Graft and corruption weakens the the moral fabric of our people, robs the poor, increases the costs of doing business, erodes tax collection efforts, and drives away investments. The World Bank estimates that at least 20 percent of government project funds ends up as kickbacks.
The World Bank, at my personal request, has conducted extensive studies which they assembled into a report entitled “Combating Corruption in the Philippines.” It presents an exhaustive analysis of corruption in this country, and puts forward a set of recommendations.
We can no longer fight corruption piecemeal. We need a comprehensive approach that would reduce opportunities for corruption; remove needless regulations and simplify procedures; eradicate the need to recover electoral expenses by corrupt means; increase public vigilance both to deter and to detect commissions of graft; reform budget processes; improve meritocracy in the civil service; target selected departments and agencies for cleansing; increase the efficiency and speed in catching offenders and their prosecution; stiffen sanctions against corruption partnerships with the private sector; and support judicial reform to make the courts part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The courts should not allow themselves to be used as a refuge for scoundrels.
I warn all departments and agencies of government to brace themselves, especially those consistently listed in surveys and studies on government corruption.
I will be submitting to Congress an urgent bill creating an anti-graft and corruption commission. This bill will provide the government with the necessary powers and resources to combat this long-festering cancer in our society. I also urge Congress to pass the anti-racketeering bill with anti-money laundering provisions.
Pigilin, supilin, sugpuin ang graft and corruption! [Applause]
As the war on graft intensifies, the war on poverty continues. Our premise is that the most effective way of eradicating poverty is through sound, noninflationary growth and development. This, however, must be complemented by focused interventions that aim directly at poverty reduction. Hence, the high priority accorded by my government to agriculture and the rural areas, education, health, housing, agrarian reform.
Agriculture, after a momentary dip in the first quarter from the 6 percent growth in 1999, resumed its robust performance with a 4.8 percent growth in the second quarter of this year.
In education, last year we constructed thousands of new classrooms, provided hundreds of thousands of new desks, addressed the teacher shortage problem, and proposed improvements to the curricula to meet both global standards and local needs. In partnership with the private sector, we have extended assistance to students by providing them access to the Internet.
In health, we launched a parallel importation program to bring down the market prices of medicines drastically and make them affordable to the poor.
For the 10-month period from July 1999 to May 2000, more than 190,000 households were provided with housing units. This represents 52 percent of the target households to be sheltered in Metro Manila and surrounding provinces.
In agrarian reform, our government has distributed a total of 523,000 hectares of land to 305,000 farmers.
We continued to lay the groundwork for future growth with continuing advances in the construction and completion of major roads and water supply basins, in the energizing of our barangays, 77.4 percent of which now have power, and in the exploitation of natural gas fields to reduce our dependence on imported oil.
We have been implementing the Clean Air Act, among others, by phasing out leaded gasoline in Metro Manila ahead of schedule. We have been removing massive debris from the Pasig River, including sunken vessels, and we continue rehabilitation works on Laguna Lake and its tributaries.
We terminated the customs valuation and surveillance contract with the SGS. We not only saved P4.2 billion a year in fees; we also exceeded our customs collection target by P3.7 billion without their help.
We pushed the passage of the e-Commerce Act, for which I thank Congress. This makes the Philippines only the fourth Asian country to have such a law. We are among the very few countries whose legal systems now recognize that trade and financial transactions are shifting away from the physical and the paper-based world to the rapid electronic highways of the Internet.
In our external relations, we agreed with the other ASEAN leaders to advance the full establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area. We continued to play an active role in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group [APEC], the Asia-Europe Meetings [ASEM], and the United Nations and its various agencies. To strengthen our bilateral partnerships, I visited China, Japan, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, and Argentina the past year. Tonight, I will be leaving for my official visit to the United States.
Since I last addressed you, our economy as a whole has experienced moderate growth, low inflation, low interest rates, strong exports, a healthy balance of payments, and record-high international reserves.
In 1999, our GDP grew by 3.4 percent while GNP rose by 3.7 percent. In the first quarter of the current year 2000, GDP rose by 3.4 percent and GNP by 3.45 percent. Not spectacular, but at least I would say respectable. The industry sector reversed its 3.6 percent decline in the first quarter of last year with a 4.8 percent rise in the first quarter this year.
Our inflation rate was 6.6 percent in 1999, and a highly commendable 3.5 percent for the first semester of this year.
Interest rates remained low. The 91-day Treasury bill rates stayed below 9 percent since the last week of June 1999. Correspondingly, commercial bank lending rates also remained soft.
Because of the rise in private consumption expenditures, the government pulled back from the pump-priming activities it had engaged in to counteract the recessionary effects of the Asian crisis. The deficit for the first five months of the current year was P34.1 billion, or P11.2 billion less than last year.
Exports, led by electronics and semiconductors, reached an impressive $11.3 billion in the first four months this year, 10.6 percent higher than for the same period last year.
We posted a balance of trade surplus of $732 million in the first quarter and $4.31 billion for the whole of 1999, reversing by multiples the $163 million deficit in 1998.
As a result of this, plus the remittances of our overseas Filipino workers, our gross international reserves reached an all-time high of $15.44 billion in May 2000, and are expected to rise to $17.1 billion by the end of the year.
The recent weaknesses in the foreign exchange rate of the peso cannot therefore be attributed to our macroeconomic fundamentals. Our fundamentals are by any standards respectable—except to those who refuse to see. In fact, barely two weeks ago, we reentered the Japanese Samurai Bond Market with a successful 5-year bond float of around $330 million.
The depreciation of the peso is the result largely of a new Asian crisis contagion: Other currencies in the region have been weakening due to political factors and the strength of the US economy and the US dollar. If the peso had not adjusted accordingly, our exports would have become less competitive. Obviously, the nervousness about the potential implications of the Mindanao conflict on the economy also contributed to the depreciation of the peso.
We were thus witness to a paradox: strong exports, large external trade and payment surpluses, and record levels of international reserves side by side with a depreciating peso.
That paradox, in fact, might be a harbinger of some dark clouds coming back. After a brief period of recovery from the financial crisis, the Asian region is suffering from a mild relapse. As mentioned, currency exchange rates are depreciating. Oil prices have gone up substantially. Unemployment is rising. And investments are nervously staying away from the East Asian region as a whole.
As we take a long, hard look at the future, what we see is the need for long, hard work ahead.
Under threat of a national and regional slowdown, we must keep working at the basics which, because they had been forgotten, led to the Asian crisis in the first place. We must keep up the pace of reforms, particularly by improving governance all around.
I must confess, however, that I find the faddish word reform as too weak and wimpish. What I believe the Philippine economy needs is not just reforms but radical restructuring.
Many are asking why is it that other Asian countries, which went through a worse crisis than we did, actually grew faster on the rebound. One reason is that we recovered from a higher base, they from a lower one. A more fundamental reason is that the very structure of the Philippine economy today was inherited from past decades of import substitution and protective policies, aggravated by economic mismanagement and corruption. Our industrial base is thin. Due to decades of neglect, our agricultural productivity is low. Our population growth rate is high. And our technology is on a catch-up mode. Rectifying these decades of historical errors and lapses will take much more than two years of any presidency.
Radical restructuring entails the modernization of the economy, both physically and electronically, to make it more productive, efficient, and globally competitive. And modernization must touch not just agriculture and industry but the brains and hands of our people, to put the country squarely on the path of the information superhighway, which in turn links the world’s knowledge-based economies into one vast global network.
Physically, the sunset industries we have inherited from the past must yield to the sunrise industries of the Internet age. Agriculture must go through a total technological conversion, and our education must catch up with the 21st century.
In the meantime, we must lay the basic foundations, the infrastructure, for enabling these modernizations to happen.
In fact, infrastructure is our response both to our long-term and our short-term needs. The expected slowdown in private consumption and investments must be counteracted by a new wave of pump-priming.
There are about $10.3 billion of official development assistance [ODA] available. One billion dollars of this can be readily used for the rehabilitation and development of Mindanao. We will attack the institutional defects and bureaucratic bottlenecks that have prevented the government in the past from utilizing the ODAs. It’s a shame that because of the bottlenecks, the disbursements on ODA-funded projects fell to $800 million last year.
There are also development funds abroad that can be made available provided they are used for major road projects here in Luzon. These we will seek to utilize.
I ask Congress to pass two vital bills: the Government Projects Expeditious Implementation Act, which limits to the Supreme Court alone the power to issue temporary restraining orders [TROs] against government projects, and the Act Providing for Measures to Facilitate the Acquisition of Right-of-Way for Government Infrastructure Projects. In addition, I ask you to approve my proposal in the 2001 budget to double the appropriations for foreign-assisted projects.
All these institutional reforms and radical restructurings, plus additional measures I will mention later, should restore and increase the country’s ability to compete for investments in the future.
As we build our infrastructure, so shall we build our information superhighway. In fact, instead of just retracing the history of other faster-growing countries, we have decided to leapfrog from the so-called old economy to the new economy using information technology, including e-commerce, to fast-track our productivity and our competitiveness.
In the 1,408 remaining days of my presidency, there is more to come. Let me share with you a few highlights of my vision for the future, which consists both of continuities from the past and of quantum leaps into new beginnings.
The economy will grow by an average of 5 percent during my term. My critics say that this target is not ambitious and lower than that of our Asian neighbors. I should remind them that this growth rate is much higher than what we achieved in the past. And if I can, for the first time, defeat the boom-bust cycle, my successor will have a good shot at achieving tiger economy growth rates. (I could see the vice president’s face smiling.) [Applause]
We will concentrate on providing both socialized and affordable housing for the poor and the wage earners. Housing is a basic human need and generates employment, which is a recession antidote.
We must by all means prevent another Payatas by encouraging the reduction, segregation, recycling, and composting of garbage, and by using alternative state-of-the-art technologies.
We will continue with our program of deregulation and liberalization. We will push through with the privatization of a number of our government corporations that have been identified and prioritized.
We will convert the power sector into a competitive, market-driven industry. This aim is to ensure a higher and more reliable power supply at lower cost to commercial and residential users. Now, may I urge Congress to pass the Power Bill as a matter of high priority.
We will push through further with reforms that strengthen our institutions. In line with this, I ask Congress to pass the new Central Bank Act, which will empower the government to add to the durability and responsiveness of what already is one of the soundest banking systems in all of Asia.
The Philippines will rapidly evolve into a center for software programming and a base for hosting and providing Internet services. As we now excel in the export of electronic products and semiconductors, we are also fast becoming a major link in the limitless world of the Internet. The big players have begun to converge here, in addition to Texas Instruments in Baguio and Acer in Subic, Clark now hosts the America Online [AOL] call center. Scheduled for signing during my trip to the US are memoranda of agreement with Oracle Inc. and with Pacific Technology International, among others.
The Philippines, in other words, is fast moving from the world of “brick and mortar” to the world of “clicks and portals.”
By linking up our schools to the world of the Internet and the cyber world, the Philippines educational system will take a giant stride in coverage and quality. Our future “e-schools” will be able to reach more students and provide relevant instruction.
The Philippine National Police will continue to pursue its policy of absolute zero tolerance against illegal drugs. It will also continue to professionalize itself in its no-nonsense fight against crime and lawlessness.
We will modernize the fighting capabilities of the entire Armed Forces of the Philippines, both in terms of personnel and equipment. Their outstanding performance in Mindanao further highlighted their importance in preserving the territorial integrity of the republic from external and internal threats.
In fact, we will streamline the entire government, enhance the quality of government service, and increase the efficiency by which basic services are delivered. In this connection, I call on Congress to pass the bill re-engineering the bureaucracy.
By way of electoral reform, 45 percent of all the 190,000 precincts all over the country will be computerized by the year 2001, and 100 percent by the elections of 2004. This program will speed up the counting of votes and eliminate opportunities for fraud. I will never tolerate election fraud since I was once cheated when I first ran for mayor of San Juan. And I know how it feels to be cheated. Fortunately, the Supreme Court declared me the winner.
Admittedly, over the past two years, the presidency itself has struggled through the challenges of coping with the learning curve made more difficult by the long-lasting effects on the corporate sector of the Asian financial crisis and by the vicious attempts of my detractors to discredit me and my family. These attacks started way back during my campaign and never let up. Unfortunately, by discrediting me, the head of state and of government, they also undermine the confidence of the international community in the country, and thereby damage the prospects for our economy.
Sa halip na tayo ay magsiraan, kailangang magkaisa at magtulungan tayo sa darating na apat na taon upang mapabilis ang ating pag-unlad. Habang tayo ay nagsisiraan at nagaaway-away, nagpapalakpakan naman ang ating karatig-bansa dahil sa kanila pumupunta ang mga dayuhang kapitalista at mga turista.
Nonetheless, the presidency has learned its lessons well. At this point, the presidency itself is poised for its own new beginnings. [Applause]
To assure crystal-clear transparency in all government transactions and to remove all opportunities for abuse by all government officials, I wish to make the following announcements.
As long as I am President, there will be no negotiated contracts in all government procurements, public works, and other construction projects. We will never allow another Amari or Centennial Expo to happen ever again. [Applause] All supply and construction contracts will be awarded through public bidding.
And to make doubly sure that future bids will be completely transparent, the government will resort to electronic public biddings, or the so-called reverse auction method, where bids from all suppliers and contractors will be posted on a website. This brings transparency to a new dimension.
As long as I am President, there will be no government guarantees issued on the loans of private firms. No creditors should be shielded by the government’s sovereign guarantees from the market risks that they themselves should bear. The risks should not be borne by the taxpayers.
The only guarantees to be given will be under the most restrictive conditions, such as those provided by the BOT law.
I shall not do to the next administration what the last one did to mine, [applause] namely, hand over multibillion-peso guarantees on failed negotiated projects that my administration now has to honor and pay.
No government financial institution shall extend any new loans, nor shall any government agency enter into any new contracts, with those with bad records and unresolved disputes with government.
We will further curb smuggling by rationalizing the operation of duty-free shops. We will confine them to traditional merchandise, like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes carried in plastic bags, not frozen chickens and cheese curls loaded on grocery shopping carts; where consumers can purchase chocolate bars, but not the refrigerators to store them in. Duty free-shops should not operate as supermarkets, and vice versa. [Applause]
I have ordered all the agencies concerned to carry out the investigation and, if warranted, the prosecution of those suspected of illegal involvement in the trading of shares of BW Resources. [Applause] Incidentally, I wish to thank the honorable members of Congress for passing the new Securities Regulation Act, which provides for stronger protection of investors from fraud and which strengthens the capabilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
I hereby order the concerned agencies to resolve the air dispute with Taiwan at the shortest time possible, taking into account the interests of our OFWs, balikbayans, and tourists, as well as cargo shippers. [Applause] We will reshape our aviation policies to promote primarily the interests of the economy.
Before I conclude, I wish to extend my administration’s gratitude and appreciation to the honorable members of Congress for acting on a significant number of measures. You have enacted a large number of important laws affecting the economy, including the Electronic Commerce Law, the Safeguard Measures Act, the Securities Regulation Code, and the Retail Trade Liberalization Law, among others. Congress worked long and hard to deliver these measures. Alam ko pong inuumaga kayo sa inyong mga sesyon at ako po naman ay taus-pusong nagpapasalamat sa inyong lahat. [Applause]
Ngunit hindi pa tayo tapos. [Laughter] May utang pa tayo sa bayan. Umaasa ako na inyong pagtitibayin ang mga panukalang batas tulad ng amendments to the ARMM Organic Act, the Power Bill, the new Central Bank Act, the Comprehensive Solid Waste Management Act, the Reengineering the Bureaucracy Act, the Anti-Racketeering Act, amendments to the Omnibus Investment Code, and the bill granting special powers for the fast-track development of Mindanao. [Applause]
Ayan, ihinuli ko na yung special power. Hindi emergency power, special power lamang. Pero nasa inyo na ‘yon.
To conclude, with all due candor:
We have done quite well, but we could have done better. We have gone quite far, but we are far from where we want to go. And before we can tell a story of success, we will have to go through a story of struggle. The weather ahead will be a bit rough before we get to see some real sunshine.
In the face of the difficulties we confront, I call on the whole country to work together in unison rather than to fall apart in dissension. We can ride the storm if we unite. It will blow us apart if we fight.
I also call on the affluent to pay their taxes correctly. [Applause] There is only one thing worse than not spending enough on pro-poor programs, and that is running excessive deficits and allowing inflation and macroeconomic instability to rob the poor.
The present uncertainties call for courage, and hope, and faith in our ability to cope and prevail. If we face these challenges with the proper spirit, we will survive the storm and thrive when the sunshine returns.
Now that I have brought my presidency through a process of renewal, I ask you once again to give me your trust and your support. Let us leave the past with all its disappointments behind, and let us shape our future together. Let us all embark on a new beginning.
As I said earlier, there are only 1,400 days left of my presidency. Ang tunay nating kalaban ay ang kahirapan. At inaamin ko na kahit na ako ang pangulo, hindi ko kayang labanan ito nang nag-iisa. Kaya kailangan ko ang tulong ninyong lahat. [Applause] Magkaisa na po tayo alang-alang sa ating bayan at sa ating mga anak na dapat na bigyan natin ng isang mapayapa, maunlad, at magandang kinabukasan.
Maraming salamat po. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

First State of the Nation AddressBy Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo14th President of the PhilippinesOpening of the 1st Regular Session of the 12th Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 2001]
His Excellency President Ramos; Senate President Drilon and the other Senators; Speaker de Venecia and the other congressmen and congresswomen; the Justices of the Supreme Court; the members of the diplomatic corps; mga maralitang tagalungsod na nanonood ngayon sa video wall at sa TV; mga maraming nakikinig sa radyo; mahal kong kababayan:
Kamakailan, may sumulat sa aking tatlong batang taga-Payatas, sina Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin. Ginawa nilang paper boats ang liham at pinalutang sa Pasig river patungo sa Malacañang.
Ito ang sinulat ng sampung taong gulang na si Jomar Pabalan: “Sana po ay mabigyan ng permanenteng trabaho ang tatay ko para hindi siya mahirapan.”
Sabi naman ni Jason Vann Banogan, 10 taong gulang: “Sana po matulungan ninyo ako na makatapos sa pag-aaral ko hanggang kolehiyo, kasi po ang nagpapaaral sa akin ay ang lola ko lamang.”
At ang tanging nais ni Erwin Dolera, walong taong gulang: ipasara ang Payatas dumpsite, at bigyan ng lupa ang kanyang pamilya.
Napakalinaw, napakasimple ang hiling ng mga anak ng Payatas: Trabaho. Edukasyon. Sariling tahanan. Idagdag na rin: pagkain sa bawat mesa. Ito ang mithiin ng masa.
And this, in common sense and plain talk, is the core of my vision.
A vision for the future must be rooted in the past.
A revolution gave birth to the first republic in Asia.
A sense of nationhood was born but also the dream of a better life for all Filipinos. Andres Bonifacio, the poor man, the great plebeian who started this revolution, nurtured this dream.
In 1963, another poor man rose. He rose to the most powerful position in the land and risked everything to fulfill the poor man’s dream.
Inspired by the great plebeian, my father, President Diosdado Macapagal, promulgated the Land Reform Law to emancipate the peasant from a feudal bondage to the soil.
In 1986 Filipinos peacefully reclaimed their civil liberties in the people power revolution. Under the leadership of Corazon Aquino, we reaffirmed our commitment to freedom and democracy on a mere stretch of highway—with hardly a drop of blood shed or a shot fired in anger.
Six months ago, on that same highway, people rose up to restore morality as the first institution of society and as the animating principle of justice and the rule of law.
Thus, we see, the historic pillars of a national vision: prosperity, freedom, justice.
Ito ang mga layuning ipinaglaban ng bayan mula nang ito’y isilang: kasaganaan, kalayaan, katarungan.
We also see in our great history a progressive advancement towards the ultimate goal to transfer power over the state from the traditional economic and political bosses to the people.
Last May 1, the poor raised their voices in anger and their fists in fury. Imprisoned in poverty, shackled to shame, denied justice in society, they personally delivered the message that, 100 years after they revolted to establish this nation, they had yet to partake of the national dream.
Dinig na dinig ko ang pahayag nila, at napakumbaba ako. Hindi ba’t nasa balikat ko ang tungkuling mamuno sa pakikibaka laban sa salot ng kahirapan? Ako na siyang anak ng tinawag na “poor boy from Lubao”?
I take this duty upon my shoulders.
I do so without fear or foreboding of failure.
For I know that the greatest obstacle we as a nation must overcome is inside us. The enemy to beat is ourselves: when we spread division rather than unity; when we put ourselves above country and profit above fairness; when we think the worst of those with whom we should be working for the common good, and when we wallow in despair rather than rise to achievement–indeed, when we make politics replace patriotism in our country’s hour of need.
Let us, here in the home of democracy, therefore resolve, to grab hold of this enemy within, and beat him.
The internal enemy engaged, the battle will not be easy. We inherited very difficult problems.
From 2.5 million jobless four years ago, unemployment now stands at 4 million. From a budget surplus in 1997 under President Ramos of more than a billion pesos, my government inherited a deficit exceeding 140 billion pesos. In the same period, poverty incidence rose from 36.8 percent of the population in 1997 to 40 percent in the year 2004.
And, unlike the situation in 1997 when a battered Asia could still lean on the strength of the advanced economies, today our main trading partners like Japan and America are slowing down as well.
But we will prevail. We will prevail because the mainstream of our nation is united.
In the May elections, this administration received a solid mandate to carry on with the business of governance and reform.
I do not view this mandate as a choice between personalities of this administration and those of the opposition.
I see it rather as a vote for all of us—administration and opposition—to roll up our sleeves, stop looking back, and move forward, most especially in the fight against mass poverty.
Hinalal tayo upang labanan ang kahirapan, hindi ang isa’t isa.
Our challenge is clear: Sugpuin ang kahirapan.
In this spirit, I appeal to everyone here today to undertake something unconventional but much to be desired in these especially hard times.
From today, let us set aside bickering and politicking for at least one year. We may congratulate ourselves on our forbearance at the next State of the Nation Address.
Sa halip ng alitan, isang taon tayong magtulungan sa ikabubuti ng taong bayan.
This is our duty. This is our mandate. This is our mission.
Unity for the country’s recovery will set the stage for national mobilization needed to undertake the great and difficult tasks ahead.
What are these tasks?
When I became president last January, I told the people about my vision of winning the war against poverty within the decade.
To succeed, the template of our national agenda must revolve around four components—apat na elemento ng pakikibaka sa kahirapan.
The first is an economic philosophy of free enterprise appropriate to the 21st century. Pagnenegosyo upang dumami ang trabaho. Not a pitiless free-for-all but free enterprise with a social conscience.
The second component is a modernized agricultural sector founded on social equity. Palalaguin ang kita at ani ng maralitang tagabukid.
The third component is a social bias toward the disadvantaged to balance our economic development plan. Pagkalinga sa mga bahagi ng lipunan na naiiwanan ng kaunlaran.
And the fourth component is to raise the moral standards of government and society. Moralidad sa gobyerno at lipunan bilang saligan ng tunay na kaunlaran.
Pagnenegosyo, pagpapaunlad ng agrikultura, kalinga sa nagigipit na sektor, at moralidad sa gobyerno at lipunan—ito ang mga sandata natin sa digmaang-bayan laban sa kahirapan.
I have therefore organized my interpretation of the state of the nation along these four components of our national antipoverty ideology.
The first is an economic philosophy for the 21st century. Under this philosophy, the way to fight poverty is to create jobs, not destroy them.
To create jobs, we will attract investments. To attract investments, we will attend to macro measures and concerns.
In addressing macro concerns, we will focus on long-term structural issues. We started with the reform of the power sector, and I congratulate those of you who are here and who were in the previous congress for this accomplishment. Now, we will turn to other basics like infrastructure, productivity, and the savings rate.
In focusing on infrastructure, we will harness the private sector via the Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Our priorities include telecommunications facilities for high-speed productivity at low cost, roads to target tourist destinations, infrastructure for the modernization of agriculture, mass transport infrastructure for Metro Manila, and commuter and transport systems to disperse communities towards Subic-Clark and CALABARZON.
We will minimize bottlenecks to productivity, such as the high cost of power, deterrents to investments in agriculture, overly confrontational labor-management relations, and corruption and red tape at the national and local government levels.
To reduce the cost of power, we will begin implementing the Power Sector Reform Law which the previous Congress just passed.
To reduce deterrents to investments in agriculture, I ask Congress to enact a law making farmland acceptable as loan collateral.
To reduce excessive friction in labor and management relations, we will go the extra mile to work for industrial peace, and to work with labor and business to retrain workers for the fast-changing technologies of the new economy.
To reduce corruption in the Executive Branch, Cabinet Secretaries will have to deliver tangible results within 12 months in fighting graft. Our new e-Procurement Program will save billions and minimize anomalies. And I gave the reinforced Presidential Anti-Graft Commission added teeth to investigate and prosecute moto propio corruption in high places. And we will make the BIR and Customs showcases in this fight against graft and corruption.
To reduce corruption among elective officials, we will help honest people get elected by financing the full computerization of elections. We have released 2 billion pesos of the 3.4 needed for computerization. I ask congress to add another 500 million in the 2002 budget. Let us make the polls of May 14, 2001 the last national elections that use primitive methods of voter identification and ballot tabulation.
To reduce red tape in the national government, within 12 months, all government agencies will implement measures to cut in half the number of signatures required for their service. Housing permits shall only need 45 approvals, instead of 188. If legislation is required to effect this efficiency, the agencies concerned will draft appropriate bills for my endorsement to Congress.
I congratulate the LTO for issuing licenses in half an hour. I congratulate the NBI for issuing clearances in one day.
I ask our local governments likewise to streamline their operations and slash red tape. There must be continuity between national and local governments in their efforts to be investor-friendly.
We will address issues related to the savings rate, so that the cost of domestic capital can be reduced. These issues are tied up with the strength of the financial and fiscal sectors.
With regard to the financial sector, I ask Congress to amend the BSP charter and the Banking Act to improve supervision and promote financial prudence. These amendments should take us out of the money laundering list.
We adhere to a freely convertible peso and market exchange rates. However, we support the Central Bank’s measures to curb speculation.
To those speculating against the peso, I only have this to say: Have you no pity for the common people, have you no love for your country? Makunsyensya naman kayo.
Instead of speculating, let us further strengthen the financial sector. We will design innovative policies to develop our capital market. We will set up a secondary housing mortgage market, an asset management company, and a provident fund for overseas Filipinos. We will simplify and clarify the system of incentives. We will interpret investment laws in favor of the investor.
And I ask Congress to enact laws on capital market reform such as the Personal Equity Retirement Act, the Investment Company Act, the Securitization Act, and amendments to the Securities Regulation Code.
With regard to the fiscal sector, we will control the budget deficit by collecting taxes vigorously and spending money prudently. For the longer term, I ask Congress to enact a law providing for a gross income tax.
Alisin na natin ang mga tax deduction na nagiging sanhi lamang ng katakut-takot na corruption.
The strength of the financial and fiscal sectors partly lies in how we use the realities in the global and regional environment to our benefit. Thus, we will enhance our relations with the United States, whose economic and military power continues to make it important as a factor in the affairs of the region and in the nation. We will also strengthen bilateral economic and political relations with Japan, our biggest source of development assistance and a major trading partner. And more and more, we will design foreign policy and foreign trade policy in the context of ASEAN. And I ask Congress to enact a law giving overseas Filipinos, who continue to play a critical role in the country’s economic and social stability, the right to vote.
Preparing our growth sectors of the future enables us to tap the opportunities of the 21st century.
We will promote fast-growing industries where high-value jobs are most plentiful. One of them is information and communications technology, or ICT. Our English literacy, our aptitude, and skills give us a competitive edge in ICT. Filipino workers are ranked number one in the field, number one among knowledge workers. And analysts point to two developing countries as the likely world centers for software development and data management in this decade: India and the Philippines. We will live up to that forecast.
As a first step, let us declare that technology is the foundation of future economic development, as China did in 1998. ICT will jumpstart our old stalling economy and make it leapfrog into the new economy.
High-speed connectivity at low cost will increase the use of ICT. It is also the way for Smart and Globe to properly interconnect. Then we will finally hear the last of those annoying words, “network busy.”
Our rules will promote rather than regulate ICT, but in turn, I ask cellular phone companies to stop charging on dropped calls; this is both irritating and unfair to the public.
I ask Congress to enact laws to address Internet privacy and security, allow for multimedia convergence, and create a department of telecommunications and information technology.
To prepare our youth to be the next generation of knowledge workers, we will upgrade math and science teaching in basic education.
We will take a hard look at education and ask: Is it preparing the youth for the jobs of the new economy? Or is it just-keeping-them-off-the-streets-until-they-are-thrown-there jobless after graduation? If they finish school at all.
To increase the chances of Filipino children finishing school, we will minimize the cost of going to school. When we stopped the collection of miscellaneous fees last enrollment day, 900,000 more students enrolled than anticipated. And to reduce the time and money spent to actually travel to school, I want a school building in every barangay by 2004. Ibig nating tumalas ang ulo ng mga estudyante, at hindi malaspag ang paa.
To improve the quality of education as required by the new economy, we will increase the number of textbooks per student as well as the quality of instruction. This year all public school students will have textbooks for priority subjects in grades 1 to 4 and in the 1st and 2nd years of high school. And they will have better paid and therefore better motivated teachers, not to mention more teachers because sound fiscal management enabled us to provide a supplemental budget of 1.5 billion pesos to hire more teachers and increase their pay without increasing our deficit.
Aside from ICT, we also have the competitive edge in tourism in the natural wonders of our country and the natural warmth of our people. We will provide the roads to those wonders and the means to take the tourists there. Thus, we will continue to liberalize the airline industry.
The second component of our national agenda to fight poverty is the modernization of agriculture founded on social equity.
Nasa bukid ang nakararaming maralita, kaya payayamanin natin ang pagsasaka at pangingisda.
There can be a million new jobs in agriculture and fisheries. Within the year, the Department of Agriculture shall begin to implement the program to generate them. We will approach this with a sense of urgency. I do not want the one million new jobs to come in the long term. I want a timetable. I want to identify accountabilities. I want milestones.
Hindi ito pangakong mapapako dahil nakasalalay rito ang kabuhayan ng milyung-milyong maralitang pilipino.
Mga kababayan kong magsasaka, ang inyong pangulo mismo ang magbabantay sa kagalingan ninyo.
Starting tomorrow I will hold office at the Department of Agriculture, until i can get a clear and demonstrable picture of our agricultural accomplishments for our first 100 days and I can see the program for the million new jobs get off the ground, and I can see that short-term goals are in sync with the goals of farmer groups and agribusiness.
Upang lumikha ng isang milyong trabaho sa kanayunan, tutuparin natin sa wakas ang Agricultural and Fisheries Modernization Act o AFMA. Hindi bababa sa 20 bilyong piso ang gagastusin upang mapalakas ang kita, ani, at huli ng magsasaka at mangingisda. Kasama na rito ang mga sumusunod: 6 na bilyon sa patubig; 2 bilyon sa postharvest facilities; 2 bilyon sa imprastraktura; 2 bilyon sa pautang; at 2 bilyon sa research and development.
There is money—and there will be money—and the Department of Agriculture shall demonstrate its capacity to use these funds.
Sa 6 na bilyong piso sa patubig at 2 bilyon sa postharvest mula Aparri hanggang Jolo, makakalikha tayo ng 800,000 trabaho. Sa pagbukas ng 200,000 ektarya ng bagong lupang masasaka, makakalikha ito ng 200,000 trabaho. Sa ganitong paraan malilikha ang 1 milyong trabaho sa kanayunan.
Ngunit dapat tiyakin ang merkado ng produksyon ng mga bagong magtatrabaho sa agrikultura at pangingisda pati na rin ng kasalukuyang magsasaka at mangingisda.
Para sa kaginhawaan ng taong bayan, dapat hindi nagkukulang ang bigas. Sabi nga ng AFMA, sikapin nating magkaroon ng rice self-sufficiency. In the meantime, we will remove the monopoly of the NFA in importation. If a shortage seems likely, we will allow the farmers themselves to import rice, basta magbayad sila ng customs duties. Gagamitin naman ang binayarang buwis para sa modernisasyon ng rice production.
Murang bigas at masaganang magsasaka—ito ang hangad natin para sa masa.
Mas malaki pa ang matutulong ng gobyerno sa mga magsasaka ng niyog oras na maresolba pabor sa magsasaka ang kaso ng coconut levy. Kapag mangyari ito, gagamitin ang pondo para sa modernisasyon ng mga niyugan. Pinawalang-bisa ko ang kautusan sa coconut levy mula sa dating administrasyon upang hindi madehado ang magsasaka. Hindi tayo hihinto habang hindi nakikinabang ang mangniyu-niyog sa coco levy fund.
To fight poverty, agricultural modernization will be socially equitable. We shall redeem in earnest the promise of land reform, a commitment that spans several presidents. Isa pa itong pangakong hindi dapat mapako.
Bawat taon, mamamahagi ang gobyerno ng 200,000 ektarya para sa reporma sa lupa: 100,000 of private land and 100,000 hectares of public land, including 100 ancestral domain titles for indigenous peoples.
We will bring our war against poverty to rural Mindanao, especially the areas most affected by the past conflicts. We have helped more than half of the 27,000 evacuee families return to their farms and rehabilitate their homes. The rest will go back home this year. In the next 12 months, we will spend 500 million pesos from the OPEC fund for community projects in these areas.
If the long-delayed Malmar irrigation dam is not completed by September, I will transfer its construction to the army engineering brigade. This dam is so important because it will irrigate 3,000 hectares immediately, with another 10,000 to follow next year.
We will make Mindanao the gateway to ASEAN by putting back on track the East ASEAN growth area.
Inshala, mahimo tinu-od ang saad sa Mindanao ubos sa akong administrasyon.
The third component of our national agenda is a social bias to balance economic development.
This social bias consists in immediate measures for the poor as well as improving and ensuring the quality of life of the masses.
Bukod sa magbubukid, maralitang taga-lungsod ang malaking sektor na kailangan ang dagliang tulong.
Upang agad silang matulungan, nabigyan na ng ating administrasyon ang karapatang bumili ng lupang tinitirahan sa mahigit 80,000 pamilyang maralita. And we will work double time to give security of land tenure to 150,000 urban poor families every year; 150,000 pamilya taun-taon ang magkakaroon ng karapatan na bumili ng sariling tirahan. Ginagawa ko ito dahil nalulungkot ako ‘pag may nakikita akong squatter sa sariling bayan.
Dapat din tugunan ang karaingan ng madla sa mahal na bilihin at kulang na sahod. Umaasa akong magpapasya ang kongreso o wage board sa nararapat na sweldo. Pansamantala, nananawagan ako sa mga negosyanteng may kakayahan: Magbigay na kayo agad ng emergency cost of living allowance. Maaari naman itong i-credit kapag may bagong sahod o allowance mula sa batas o sa wage board.
Sa kabilang dako, kumikilos ang gobyerno upang mapigilan ang pagtaas ng presyo ng mga pangunahing pangangailangan ng manggagawa. Binabantayan ang presyo ng langis, at salamat naman na bumaba ito noong Biyernes. Pinagsisikapan din ng gobyernong huwag itaas ang pasahe, lalo na ang LRT.
Dahil ang presyo ng bigas ay napakaimportante sa mga manggagawa, magpapasada tayo ng 1,000 rolling stores. Ang mga manggagawa at maralita ay makakabili dito ng bigas sa halagang 14 na piso sa halip na 18 bawat kilo.
Bababa din ang presyo ng gamot. Sa loob ng isang taon hahatiin natin ang presyo ng gamot na madalas bilhin ng madla.
At upang iwasan ang malaking gastos sa pagpapagamot, itong taon, ilalahok sa national health insurance ang kalahating milyong maralitang taga-lungsod. Sa ganoong paraan, ang insurance ang magbabayad ng pagpapagamot.
At upang maiwasan ang pag-upa na nagbabantang tumaas, tinutulungan natin na magkaroon ng sariling tahanan ang mga manggagawa at maralita. Handa na ang 10,000 tahahan sa iba’t ibang lugar para lumipat na rito ang manggagawa at maralita. Pinondohan na rin natin ang pagtayo ng 18,000 pang tahanan. Taun-taon, magtatayo ng 100,000 tirahan para sa manggagawa at 50,000 pabahay para sa higit na maralita. Nakahanda sa government financial institutions ang 20 bilyong piso para sa pabahay ng manggagawa.
Itaga ninyo: 20 bilyong piso para sa mga tahanan ng masa. Ito ang handog ng gobyerno para sa seguridad ng pamilyang Pilipino.
Upang mapatakbo ng mabuti ang mga programang ito, hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na lumikha ng kagawaran ng pabahay. A department of housing will not only build homes for the poor, it will also spark the housing industry and create jobs.
Hinihiling ko rin sa Kongreso na sa tax reform na gagawin ninyo, damihan ang kategoriya ng manggagawang hindi na kailangang magbayad ng buwis.
Mayroon tayong espesyal na proyekto para sa mga kabataang maralita ng Metro Manila na hindi na makapag-aral, ngunit walang trabaho. This is the Emergency Employment Program. Bawat taon, 20,000 out-of-work, out-of-school youth ang bibigyan ng dagliang trabaho. Maaari magtagpi ng bubong, mag-ayos ng railing, mag-gwardya sa eskwela ng kanilang barangay, maglinis ng kalsada o estero, o iba pang dagliang trabaho.
The social bias in our economic development plan involves ensuring the quality of life of the masses.
Sa sulat ni Erwin na taga-Payatas—‘yung binanggit ko kaninang pag-umpisa ng diskurso—hiniling niya na ipasara ang dumpsite. Talaga namang dapat nang magkaroon tayo ng bagong sistema sa pag-aasikaso ng basura. Basura ang sanhi ng maraming problema sa siyudad: masamang hangin, paglaganap ng sakit, trapik, at iba pa. Tapusin na natin ito. Inatasan ko ang Metro Manila Development Authority na bago makalipas ang isang taon, maglunsad ng programa upang ayusin ang problema ng basura.
Suyang-suya na rin tayong lahat, lalo na ang madla, sa trapiko ng Metro Manila. Babawasan ang trapik sa tulong ng mass transit. Nagtatayo tayo ng limang bagong linya ng mass transit para makapagbigay-ginhawa sa halos 4 na milyong pasahero. Tatlong linya matatapos sa 2004, isa sa 2005, at isa pa sa 2006. These five mass transit systems are being prioritized because they will add 119 kilometers of railway projects. During construction, I expect the MMDA to minimize the resulting congestion, and I expect it to minimize the current congestion within six months.
Masyadong masikip ang Metro Manila, kaya miserable ang buhay sa slum areas. Magkakaroon ng mabilis na transportasyong magdurugtong ng mga karatig-rehiyon sa Kamaynilaan. Ang nasisikipan na sa Maynila, makakalipat balang araw sa maaliwalas na lalawigan.
We will decongest Metro Manila by attracting communities north towards Subic-Clark, and south towards CALABARZON and Batangas port. We will achieve this not by demolishing shanties but by building commuter and transport systems to better homes.
Whether in Metro Manila or in the countryside, we will make microfinance a cornerstone in our fight against poverty. Ang ibig sabihin nito ay maliliit na paluwagan para sa maliliit na negosyo. Kakalisensiya lang ng opportunity microfinance bank, ang unang microlending program sa bansa na naging bangko. Bawat taon, dadagdagan natin ng 300,000 maralitang kababaihan ang makikinabang sa paluwagang programa ng microfinance.
Panahon na upang makinabang ang maliliit sa iniimpok ng bayan. At umasa kayo, nagbabayad ang masa. In microfinance, the repayment rate is 98 percent.
Wala pang kuryente ang marami nating barangay. Kaya araw-araw, gabi-gabi, magkakabit ng kuryente sa apat na barangay. Sa ganoon, 85 porsyento ng barangay ay magkakailaw na sa loob ng isang taon.
With exports slowing down due to the world downturn, we will strengthen the domestic market. We will intensify efforts to promote small and medium enterprises or SMEs especially in the countryside. Last Friday I inaugurated the SME board in the Philippine Stock Exchange. To help small and medium enterprises, I will restore the policy of providing government guarantee for their bank loans.
The fourth component of our national agenda is improving moral standards and the rule of law.
We need every ounce of resource to wage this war on poverty. We cannot afford to lose anything to waste or graft and corruption.
First we must strengthen justice and the enforcement of law and order.
This pertains to two levels. At the level of principle, this administration affirms its commitment to the principle that no one is above the law.
Thus, our policy is to support the fair and speedy trial of all the accused involved in the cases against Former President Joseph Estrada.
If there were times that I showed concern for the personal circumstances of the former president, it is not a sign of diminished determination to see justice done.
Rather, it is out of sensitivity to the feelings of the segments of our masa who have continued to identify with his personal circumstances.
But as I sometimes extend a hand covered by a velvet glove, inside it is an iron hand where justice and the rule of law are concerned.
As a sign of this, I will support legislation to amend the charter of the ombudsman so he can accept the services of private prosecutors.
The second level pertains to our sense that justice prevails and the rule of law works in our daily lives.
A reenergized police will stamp out the crimes that have plagued our businesses, terrorized the common folk, and embarrassed our country. In the economics of fighting crime, the more resources devoted to crime prevention, the less the amount of crime. Our administration will spend to modernize and professionalize the police. We will start with 1 billion pesos.
Although the numbers say that index crimes in the first semester were down 14 percent since a year ago, we are determined to stamp out violent crimes altogether. The ongoing reorganization of the police is part of the effort to add vigor to its anti-crime drive. The new national anti-crime commission will tighten coordination among law enforcement agencies as well as with the Chinese-Filipino community. We are giving special attention to the kidnap-for-ransom syndicates. I want the bulk of them to be behind bars before the year is over, so that every Filipino will at last feel safe in his home, in his workplace, and in his streets.
On the drug front, I ask Congress to enact a law reducing the amount of drugs in a suspect’s possession for him to be charged with drug trafficking.
We will uphold law and order through a holistic response consisting of political, economic, psychosocial, and security components. We will meet the defense and security challenges of this era. To achieve this end, we have earmarked additional funding in several billions of pesos for the AFP modernization program.
We have given the Armed Forces and the police the leeway to fight a treacherous and elusive enemy in Basilan. But it must end, and it will end soon, for good. The leadership of the Abu Sayyaf has started to fall. The crackdown has neutralized 130 of them. Many of them have come down from their mountains because they have been abandoned by their leaders. Itaga ninyo sa bato: tatapusin natin ito.
On the peace process, while the AFP stands ready to protect our people at a moment’s notice, we will continue to talk with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the National Democratic Front as long as all sides maintain good faith. Our ceasefire agreement with the MILF last month encouraged us in this.
To attain our full potential as a nation, let us come to terms with the fundamental issues in Mindanao. Let us forge consensus on a just, lasting, and honorable peace in one country. Peace and development are inseparable twins. But our framework must not compromise constitutionality, national sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Instead, let us recognize that we have a multiethnic society which should be founded on social justice for all and institutionalized accommodation of ethnic traditions. This would finally introduce a new culture in our nation’s attitude towards Mindanao.
We will also introduce a new culture in governance: a culture of plain talk and common sense.
Cabinet secretaries will do less cluster and interagency committee work so they can concentrate on running their departments. Less meetings, more action, more tangible results whether in generating jobs, improving peace and order, or fighting graft.
I throw full support behind BIR commissioner Rene Bañez. He has undertaken a mission many believe impossible: overhauling the BIR which accounts for 80 percent of our tax revenues.
Rene has been threatened. He has been blocked by restraining orders at every turn. After the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, he was accused of the very corruption he is stamping out.
This man needs friends, who share his goals, and I know he will find them in this young Congress.
The Bureau of Customs is exceeding collection targets. But the anti-smuggling drive must be relentless. So must the drive against the harassment of legitimate businessmen doing legitimate imports. I call on all concerned to help end the open drawer syndrome.
But the government cannot do it alone. It cannot do it alone in customs, it cannot do it alone in fighting graft, it cannot do it alone in fighting poverty. I’m not a miracle worker. All of us must do our share. We have to think Filipino, buy Filipino, invest Filipino. I invite the taipans and other business people all over the country to start pump-priming the economy by investing once again in the Philippines. I invite you to create jobs, accelerate progress, and thereby address the root causes of the crime and unrest that so much alarm us.
Sa madaling salita, mga kababayan, magkaisa tayo at magtulung-tulong upang labanan ang salot ng kahirapan at isulong ang kasaganaan, kapayapaan, at katarungan sa bayan. Magkaisa tayo. Labanan ang kahirapan.
Marami na akong sinabi tungkol sa gagawin ko. Subalit mabibigkas sa ilang salita lamang ang pakay ng lahat ng mga plano, programa, at panukalang tinukoy ko: trabaho, edukasyon, sariling tahanan, pagkain sa bawat mesa.
Sa lahat ng mabibigay ko sa bayan, kabuhayan, karunungan, tahanan, at pagkain para sa masa ang ipagmamalaki ko nang higit sa lahat.
Lahat ng ito ay para sa mga kabataang tulad nila Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin, at sa magiging anak nila dahil tungkulin natin ito sa mga darating na henerasyon.
Mga kababayan, nais ko pong ipakilala sa inyo ang mga anak ng Payatas. Eto sina Jason, Jomar, at Erwin.
Salamat sa inyo, Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin. Salamat at sumulat kayo sa akin ng mga liham na ginawa ninyong bangkang papel at pinalutang sa Pasig.
Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin, pakinggan niyo ako.
Paparamihin natin ang mga kababayang may trabaho. Paparamihin natin ang mga batang makapag-aaral sa kolehiyo. Paparamihin natin ang mga kababayang may sariling tahanan. Paparamihin natin ang pamilyang may pagkain sa mesa. Ang pangarap ninyo ay pangarap ko rin. Gagawin ko ang lahat upang matupad ang pangarap natin.
Mga kababayan: tulungan ninyo akong tuparin ang pangarap nila Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin. Magkaisa tayo upang lahat ng kabataan—kasama ang kanilang magulang—ay magkaroon ng bagong buhay at bagong pag-asa sa hinaharap.
Trabaho. Tahanan. Edukasyon. Pagkain sa bawat mesa.
Salamat, Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin, pinaalala ninyo sa akin ang napakahalagang tungkulin ko.
Pinaalala ninyo sa aming lahat kung bakit kami ay narito ngayon sa bulwagang ito.
Mga Senador at Kongresista: Ipangako natin sa kanila, sa harap at sa tulong ng Poong Maykapal, na sa mga susunod na araw, buwan, at taon, tayong mga hinalal, tayong may pananagutan sa kanilang kinabukasan ay handang magsakripisyo at magkaisa para sa kabutihan, kaunlaran, katatagan ng bayan, at sa kinabukasan ng kabataan.
Jayson, Jomar, at Erwin, hindi namin kayo bibiguin.
I am not a miracle worker. But I will do what is right and I will do my best. Let us all do what is right, let us all do what is best, and God will take care of the rest.
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat.

Second State of the Nation Address By Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo 14th President of the Philippines Opening of the 2nd Regular Session of the 12th Congress
[Delivered at Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 22, 2002]
Thank you, Speaker Jose de Venecia.
Senate President Franklin Drilon; the Justices of the Supreme Court; distinguished members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; His Excellency Archbishop Antonio Franco, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps; your excellencies of the diplomatic corps; members of the Cabinet; members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines; members of the police; fellow workers in government; honored guests.
Mga minamahal kong kababayan.
In the corridors of power, in the Palace where I work, past presidents of the Republic sit in their portraits in judgment of me. In this gallery of the highest public servants, none sits in sterner judgment than the man who first led me by the hand into the Palace as a teenager.
In a country where a man’s worth was measured by his property, he was born in a nipa hut, into a family that tilled less than a hectare of land.
After years of hard struggle and brilliant achievement, my father took his oath as President of the Philippines on ground made hallow by the martyrdom of our national hero. A hero whose name he would honor, and whose ideals he would pursue.
Indeed, in a democracy, a man may rise to the nation’s highest service by dint of energy and intelligence alone, without regard to wealth and connections of which my father had none.
It was Jose Rizal who wrote: “A life not dedicated to a great ideal is useless; a mere pebble in the field that forms no part of an edifice.”
The words of Diosdado Macapagal echoed this theme as he assumed the mantle of national leadership 40 years ago: “No President can build the whole edifice of a nation. All that he is called upon to do is add a fine stone to that edifice, so that those who shall come after him may add other fine stones that will go for a strong and enduring structure.”
Modest words from a modest man who would yet change for all time how a feudal society would come to view a vital institution—land reform.
My countrymen, the fine stone I should like to add to the edifice of our nation, right above the stone of social justice that my father left behind, is a strong republic.
Two essential features mark out a strong republic. The first is independence from class and sectoral interests so that it stands for the interests of the people rather than of a powerful minority. The second is the capacity, represented through strong institutions and a strong bureaucracy, to execute good policy and deliver essential services—the things that only governments can do.
The results of these two features—good policies and empowered institutions—is faster economic development and social reform. A strong republic takes care of the people and takes care of their future. Thus, a strong republic is the bedrock of the victory we seek over poverty within the decade.
During these past 18 months, our efforts to build the strong republic have been difficult, with both domestic and global conditions extremely harsh. At home, the poor were pitted against the rich to further inflame our nation’s social divisions. Abroad, the contracting economies of our main trading partners were further aggravated by the tensions generated by the global war against terrorism.
Meanwhile, one shocking corporate scandal after another severely eroded public faith in the most promising system for conducting economic activity—the free market.
These were the large long-term crises of social justice and the capitalist system itself, whose resolution awaits events well beyond one small nation’s ability to influence in the short term.
But as I report on the state of the nation today, I can say this: The immediate crises have been resolved.
This resolution was achieved by focusing on three things.
First, by showing tangible results in the delivery of government services. Thus, in my State of the Nation Address last year, I did something never done before: I detailed a long list of measurable targets that would show a government on the move, marking progress by swift sure steps, despite the turbulent state of domestic and global affairs.
Halimbawa, target natin noong isang taon: 200,000 ektarya para sa land reform. Nakamit natin: 250,000 ektarya. [Applause] Congratulations sa mga probinsiyang topnotchers: Negros Occidental, at Sultan Kudarat, [applause] itong dalawang  probinsiya bawat isa ay humigit ng 7,000 ektarya ng reporma sa lupa.
Target natin: 20 bilyong piso para sa modernisasyon ng agrikultura. Nakamit natin: 24 na bilyon. [Applause]
Target natin: 150,000 pamilyang maralitang tagalunsod na makatitiyak sa lupang tinitirikan. Nakamit natin: 180,000. [Applause]
Target natin: 150,000 pamilyang mahihirap na magkaroon ng pabahay. Nakamit natin: 150,000 na nga. [Applause]
Target natin: 1,000 rolling stores na magbebenta ng bigas sa P14 per kilo. Nakamit natin: 1,500 rolling stores. [Applause]
Target natin: ibaba sa kalahati ang presyo ng gamot na madalas bilhin ng mahihirap. Nakamit natin: Mahahanap ang mababang presyong gamot sa mga parmasya ng 80 ospital ng pamahalaan at sa mga outlet ng Unilab. [Applause] But sad to say, except for Unilab, the wider distribution of network of commercial drugstores—under pressure from the multinational drug companies—will not sell our cheaper medicines. We are studying punitive measures to correct this unfair, unjust, and heartless situation. [Applause]
Target natin: 500,000 maralita para sa health insurance. Nakamit natin: 4 na milyon. [Applause]
Target natin: pagdating ng 2004, may eskwela sa bawat barangay. May 1,612 na barangay na wala pang eskwela. Nakamit natin: 1,005 na malapit nang matapos, bukod pa sa 285 school buildings na humahalagang P100 million galing sa alokasyon ni Senate President Franklin Drilon. [Applause]
Target natin: kompletong libro sa pangunahing subjects sa grades 1 to 4 at sa 1st at 2nd year high school. Nakamit natin: Magkakaroon ngayong taon ng 54 million books para sa 16 na milyong estudyante. [Applause]
Target natin: pag-ibayuhin ang pagtuturo ng mathematics. Nakamit natin: dagdag na oras para sa Math sa bagong curriculum.
Target natin: mas maraming guro. Nakamit natin: 15,000 bagong guro. [Applause]
Target natin: dagliang trabaho para sa 20,000 out-of-school youth. Nakamit natin: 30,000. [Applause]
At noong isang taon, dinala ko ang tatlong batang kumatawan sa adhkain ng Payatas. Sabi nila, ang kailangan nila ay edukasyon, kabuhayan, pabahay. Higit na 400 na batang taga-Payatas ay iskolar na ngayon, kasama na si Jayson, Erwin, at Jomar. [Applause] Halos 800 pamilya ang nabigyan ng kabuhayan kasama ang pamilya nila. May 700 pamilyang binigyan ng karapatang bilhin ang lupang kanilang tinitirahan nila doon sa Payatas. Inaatasan ko ang Department of Environment and Natural Resources na apurahin ang pag-ayos ng natitirang problema sa lupa ng mga residente sa Payatas. [Applause]
This is just the tip of our accomplishments, all in just the first year of the 10-year fight I projected against poverty. I am submitting the entire iceberg to Congress in a comprehensive performance report. For good measure, it has been published and nationally circulated. These were our commitments. We delivered on them. A strong republic does what it says.
It takes care of the people and takes care of their future.
Our second focus to achieve the resolution of the immediate crises was the preservation and defense of the republic against forces that seek to destroy its unity and tear the fabric of its society, not least in the name of ideas that history has already passed by.
The turning points are clear.
This year, May 1 passed peacefully.
This year, our soldiers rescued Gracia Burnham and finished off her terrorist captor. [Applause]
This year, what used to be Camp Abubakar became an authentic community of new hopes and dreams, where our flag flies and our soldiers protect those who have returned to their homes.
Beyond the symbolic significance of these accomplishments, we have brought back interfaith solidarity, energized by the invaluable initiative of Speaker Jose de Venecia, [applause] and we have sealed peace agreements with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
We achieved all of these backed by the valor, professionalism, and restraint of our soldiers and police. I salute our men and women in uniform, at the forefront of our Republic’s efforts to fight terror and enforce peace.
The third focus to resolve the crises and build a strong republic was to restore macroeconomic stability and win back investor confidence.
The linchpin was to control our fiscal deficit. If EDSA 2 had not happened, the government would simply have gone bankrupt with a deficit of P245 billion. [Applause] But we controlled the deficit, brought it down to P147 billion, and against all odds, turned our international credit rating from risky to stable. [Applause] It was hard work, here and abroad, to rekindle global interest in our country, but we did it. [Applause]
The adoption of strong administrative measures, including fighting smuggling and graft and corruption, will enable us to close the gap in our revenue targets for this year.
The basic macro signs indicate that things are under control. Inflation is at a low, driven down by stable food prices and now by declining power costs. [Applause]
Nang ako ay naging Pangulo, ang presyo ng galunggong ay 80 pesos ang kilo. Noong isang linggo, nakabili ako sa palengke ng 60 pesos lamang. [Applause] Ang presyo rin ng bigas na binibili ng mahihirap ay nananatiling P16 ang kilo sa palengke at P14 sa rolling store, gaya pa rin nang isang taon. [Applause]
Interest rates are also at a low, and our peso is stable. From P56 to the dollar, it is now a little over P50. [Applause]
Internationally, the Philippines is back on the map.
We are the third best performing economy is Asia and the best in southeast Asia. [Applause]
As a result of our decisive action after September 11, the Philippines is now a recognized player in world affairs. The President of the Philippines was the first head of government to emphasize the interconnection between the war against terrorism and the war against poverty. Now, nations large and small now embrace this interconnection. [Applause]
We have gained powerful allies in our domestic war against terrorism. I am certain that our increased international visibility will continue generating capital inflows for the Philippines.
Where we have fallen short of achieving what we intended, it has not been from misdirection or a lack of trying. After all, it has really been only one year and a half.
In any event, I promise to work even harder if that is possible, and do even better because I believe that there is always room for improvement. I cannot grow taller but I can always get better. [Applause]
My working agenda for the coming year will focus on creating and improving job opportunities. Citizens with rewarding jobs paying decent wages constitute not just a stone in the edifice but the very foundation of a strong republic.
We need investments to generate jobs, and to draw in investments, we will address certain problems in the short term: katiwalian, peace and order, and the cost of power. [Applause]
Bilang Pangulo, tinatanggap ko ang pahayag ng mga negosyante na dapat sugpuin ang katiwalian sa bansa.
Noong isang taon nga sa aking State of the Nation Address, sinabi ko na, na aalisin natin ang mga hadlang sa ating productivity, kagaya ng mahal na kuryente at katiwalian.
At dahil ako ay naluklok sa pagkapangulo dala ng malawakang galit sa anomaliya, alam kong kailangan wakasan ang katiwalian. [Applause] Naniniwala rin ako na pinahihina ng katiwalian ang daloy ng puhunan sa ating bansa.
Kaya noong isang taon, sinabi ko na ang kabinete ko ay kailangan gumawa ng konkretong resulta sa paglaban sa katiwalian. Pinapaalala ko sa kanila ngayon na sa mga sumusunod na araw, magbigay ng kanilang ulat sa naturang mga resulta.
But even now I can tell you that our new e-Procurement Program is saving billions and minimizing anomalies.
Even now, I can tell you that the Presidential Anti-Graft Commission [PAGC] is doing its best to ensure that good governance is carried out. Inaatasan ko ang PAGC na gumawa rin ng ulat sa kanilang trabaho.
Tungkol naman sa katiwalian sa mga korte, inaatasan ko ang Department of Justice [DOJ] na kasuhan yung prosecutor na tinuloy pa iyong kaso kontra sa Kimberly-Clark kahit nagkaroon na ng affidavit of desistance ang complainant. Kaya tuloy ang Kimberly-Clark ay dinala iyong kanyang Asia operations sa Thailand imbes na sa Pilipinas. Inaasahan ko ring kasuhan ng DOJ iyong prosecutor na ginawang accessory lamang embes na principal iyong ilang mga nagkidnap kay Rowena Tiu. At inaatasan ko rin ang DOJ na kasuhan pati na rin ang mga huwes na gumagawa ng katiwalian. [Applause]
Noong isang taon, sinabi ko na gagawin nating sample ang BIR at Customs sa paglaban sa katiwalian. This is still a continuing effort. Tax evasion is a white-collar crime and the response is a white collar response—systems improvement, audit, prosecution. Smuggling is something else. It is done by hoodlums and criminal gangs. But the punishment for both must be the same: blue-collar time. Kalaboso. [Applause]
Indeed, criminal gangs and homegrown terrorists have exploited the poisoned political atmosphere to spread poisons of their own: rampant smuggling, kidnapping, gambling, drug dealing, rampant smuggling.
You have seen political will in the harsh interpretation of command responsibility with regard to illegal gambling. That draconian application was a dress rehearsal for enforcing command responsibility in the even more difficult challenges of kidnapping, drug dealing, and smuggling. [Applause]
I am determined to build a strong republic by breaking the back of terrorism and criminality. [Applause]
In the year 2000, despite all the rampant efforts of rampant smuggling, only P16 million worth was confiscated. But last year, in a show of political will, my administration seized P1.2 billion worth of smuggled goods, [applause] including more than a million bags of smuggled rice, as compared to much less than a hundred thousand the year before. [Applause]
I congratulated the Commissioner of Customs but told him also: Go beyond getting smuggled goods and get me the big-time smugglers. [Applause] I have instructed the DOJ to charge these big-time smugglers not just with smuggling but also with economic sabotage—nonbailable capital offense. [Applause]
Criminal syndicates will be treated as what they are—direct threats to national security. Criminals are criminals, whether of the common kind or the kind that kill in the name of political advocacies. They will feel the full brunt of the arsenal of democracy. Freedom, too, is entitled to self-defense. [Applause]
I have given very clear orders to spare nothing in hunting down kidnappers.
We will go by scorecards and track progress by counting beans, if we have to.
Remember Mary Grace Rosagas of Uratex who was kidnapped from UP. Remember her aunt Connie Wong who was killed by the kidnappers. Remember Rowena Tiu who was kidnapped in La Union. Remember the owner of Liana Supermarket. Remember the whispers about the kidnapping of the granddaughter a big banker and the son of a steel magnate. We have taken down the syndicates responsible for kidnapping them and 52 other victims. [Applause] In the process, 170 kidnappers were either killed or captured.
The ideal response to kidnapping was in the case of Rowena Tiu. She was rescued in 8 days, the ransom money recovered, and her kidnappers were arrested and are now facing trial. That is why hers was the first but the last kidnapping to take place in Region I in my administration. [Applause]
I want to smash the other 21 syndicates in the same way. [Applause] We are getting a clearer picture of the leadership, membership, and area of operations of these syndicates. I now want their linkages and modus operandi. I am overseeing how they are being watched, tracked, and infiltrated. We will start with the two biggest syndicates, the Bucala and Fajardo gangs. I have challenged the Philippine National Police [PNP] to eliminate them within a year. [Applause]
I have told the PNP that they must start with the cleansing of their own ranks. You remember the front page photograph of that shootout last Saturday? In the front seat next to the driver was a PNP Academy Graduate but AWOL from the police force. He was the planner and the negotiator of that gang. The rascals among the police disgrace the uniform and unfortunately paint in the same broad brush the majority who do their duty well.
I salute the men and women of the police who scorned to be bribed and confiscated 500 kilograms of shabu in Quezon Province last year, and caught the biggest fish so far in the drug trade. [Applause]
I salute the men and women who raided the shabu factories in Batangas, Zambales, San Juan, Varsity Hills, and other places, seizing a total of P5 billion worth of illegal drugs and laboratory equipment in the largest drug busts ever in our history of crime fighting. [Applause]
Within a month, we shall organize the new Dangerous Drugs Board and the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency which Congress has just created, and I thank Senator Barbers for sponsoring the bill in the Senate. With the drug menace now elevated to the level of a national security problem and no longer just a police problem, I am instructing the Armed Forces of the Philippines to field military resources for intelligence and to field soldiers in drug raids in support of civilian law enforcement. Drug lords will be treated as enemies of the State!
In this war with the drug trade there will be no compromise and no quarter, not for fear or favor.
Indeed, we are at war: at war with the terrorists, at war with the kidnappers, at war with the drug lords—and we are determined to win decisive victories on all fronts.
The global antiterrorist coalition is a historical watershed. This new global consensus helps us immensely in finally breaking the cycle of terrorism and criminality. To that end, we shall enhance our strategic relationship with the United States through continuing training exercises to sharpen our soldiers’ capabilities to move and communicate, to fix and finish off their targets.
I am happy to let you know that yesterday we captured the mastermind of the General Santos bombings that killed and maimed 80 persons a few months ago. This man that they captured yesterday is considered the number one terrorist bomber.
We cannot afford to lose. Even a stalemate will be a defeat. For what is at stake is our country as a viable proposition in the world economy. And we must be viable if we are to win the most fundamental war, the war against poverty.
I ask the newly elected barangay captains to take an active role in this war. To be the frontliners in this fight in your communities.
And as with war in the past, so will it be with this war. As Commander in Chief, I am taking a direct hand in the war against the enemies of the Republic. This was how I did it with the Abu Sayyaf, leading to the death of Abu Sabaya. This is how I will do it with the criminal gangs.
Nakasalalay dito ang pamamayani ng ating Republika. Our strong republic.
At stake in this war is the very life of society, the very possibility of basic rights and liberties, which have been under attack for too long.
The right to work in peace is as basic as the right to life and liberty, and when both are in danger their preservation by all lawful means becomes not just a higher right but an overriding duty. And that duty I will discharge.
This is a war we will wage on behalf, and with the rage, of all the victims: those whose businesses were ruined by extortion, those held down by poverty in fear, those whose lives were snuffed out by addiction, and those taken hostage and killed. To them, I say: We shall redeem your pain; we shall redeem your loss.
I endorse to the collective wisdom of Congress, with a great sense of urgency, a new bill that will strengthen our legal armory in this war: the Anti-Terrorism Bill. When passed into law, this bill will plug the loopholes by which crimes spread and democracy is undermined. Congress will also note a reallocation of resources in this year’s budget to enhance the Republic’s crime-fighting capabilities.
There are a number of other critical bills linked closely to the overall run of social, economic, and political reform. I will hold more meetings with the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council, or LEDAC, to push this momentum of reform.
We must team up, as I said last year, to enact a law making farmland acceptable as loan collateral in order to remove a big deterrent to investments in agriculture.
We must pass the Special Purpose Vehicle Act in order to encourage asset management companies to put back into productive circulation assets now tied up in problematic loans.
We must pass a law to give overseas Filipinos the right to vote, consistent with the Constitution. We must pass the bill that will give equal respect and recognition to an overseas Filipino’s dual citizenship, consistent with our national honor. This is the least return for the enormous contribution of our overseas Filipinos to the national welfare.
We must pass the Transco Franchise Bill to make our electric service more efficient and more reliable.
Everywhere I go, I ask people about their electric bill. This is not just a pet concern for the moment. I think about it all the time.
You have seen your recent electric bills. You know they have gone down. Because I brought down the PPA.
I did not invent the PPA. I merely inherited it. But my administration chose to confront and stare it in the face and find the solutions.
Before I became President, we had the second most expensive power rates in Asia. Now we have gone down to sixth. This is first fruit of a comprehensive 10-point plan we have put in place to reduce power costs.
We have brought electricity for the first time to the barangays of Balud, Masbate, of Lake Lanao, and 1,500 other barangays.
We have improved the electric service in Boracay by taking over the electric cooperative. To other electric cooperatives, I ask you: be efficient in your operations and improve your customer service.
To the electric utilities, I ask you: be transparent in your procurement and your contracts with your affiliates.
To NAPOCOR and Meralco I ask you: Stop bickering and instead work together to give price incentives to large users so that excess power can be utilized, economic activity can be encouraged, and jobs can be created.
The results of the review of the contracts of independent power producers are in. We have three months to carry out the concrete courses of action stemming from this review that will further ease the burden on our people.
Soon we shall have the first-ever wholesale electricity spot market in Asia, without the pitfalls of California. In due time, we will give electric consumers the power to choose their electricity suppliers. We are giving you the power of choice.
The power of choice will lead to lower prices and better service.
With cheaper power will come a more competitive economy, and more investors.
We know where we are going and how to get there; we are planting the milestones along the way to a strong republic and a prosperous country.
A republic does not exist by the mere fact of declaring itself to be so.
A republic must be so in fact, in reality, and especially in the difference it makes for the better in the lives of its citizens.
It is not a given but a task, a product undertaken by an entire society for its progress and preservation.
A republic is like a shield that needs a strong arm to hold it up.
A republic is a roof, and walls, that need to be constructed.
A republic is an edifice towards the building of which each must give the finest stone within their ability to shape. In the end, this stone is the only thing by which one will be remembered.
Like my father, I am working on my stone. The stone of the strong republic. I intend to be well remembered.
Legions of ordinary Filipinos, many of them students, came, stood, and clamored at EDSA, for a better government.
It is to them I look for validation.
I know that it is to me that those many Filipinos are looking for the vindication of their decision to go to EDSA. I shall not disappoint them.
It is for them that I am working hard on that stone that will fit just above my father’s, adding security to social justice, and prosperity to the promise of social equality in which he believed so much.
Ang malakas na republika ay para sa mahihina, para sa mahihirap, para sa walang trabaho, para sa nagugutom, para sa nanganganib, para sa agrabyado, para sa mga api. ‘Yan ang malakas na republika para sa kanila.
Toward the achievement of this strong republic, I shall bring to bear the full weight of the Executive, and call upon local government officials to add their own. This is our common struggle; it shall be our shared victory.
I hope to get from Congress at least the same cooperation it extended to me last year.
The judicial branch needs no reminder of its key role in the unspoken component of justice, fairness, integrity, and truth in the equation of law and order.
It has been 18 months of putting out small fires and soothing hurt feelings, while taking what I hope have been giant steps forward in the economy.
But now the time has come. Now we must devote ourselves entirely to taking more of those giant steps towards the achievement of the strong republic.
As I look back, down the road on which I came, I see, with some regret, the shards of broken friendships. But I console myself by looking forward to a time when these broken friendships will heal and grievances will be forgotten in the collective satisfaction of our common success.
For in the end, we are one nation under God, one people, with one aspiration: A country as good as it can get!
For a country to be as good as it can get, many of the right decisions are tough decisions. I have made some of the toughest. And I will make even more tough decisions in the year to come. Because the easy way out may postpone the pain but only prolong the problem. The tough decisions are the right decisions, because they serve the people, and are the source of our hope for the future.
In the last year and a half:
I led our nation in making the world recognize and respect our economic discipline.
I led our soldiers in defeating the Abu Sayyaf.
I led our government in meeting the targets we so bravely set for the welfare of our people.
Now I will lead our country towards the strong republic.
Stay with me. Samahan niyo ako! Itayo natin ang matatag at malakas na republika!
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat.

Third State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 12th Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambasa, Quezon City, on July 28, 2003]
Thank you Speaker de Venecia.
Vice President Guingona; President Ramos; Senate President Drilon; Chief Justice Davide and the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court; distinguished members of the Senate and House of Representatives; His Excellency Archbishop Franco and excellencies of the diplomatic corps; members of the Cabinet; General Abaya and the officers of the Armed Forces; General Ebdane and the members of the police; fellow workers in government; ladies and gentlemen.
Yesterday, without bloodshed, without damage to property, and within a single day, we overcame an ill-conceived mutiny carried out by misguided military officers. Such actions are deplorable and will be met with the full force of the law, including their political component. Yet they signal an underlying problem that we must address.
I am constituting an independent commission to investigate the roots of the mutiny and the provocations that inspired it. At the request of Defense Secretary Angelo Reyes, I am also constituting an independent commission to investigate the Davao bombing.
These will be matched by a PNP Reform Commission. I thank the National Police for their solid support in yesterday’s crisis, and I am sure they themselves welcome a comprehensive reform that will cure the organization not only of the failures of the scale of the Al-Ghozi escape, but also the daily devils that are the kotong cops.
By now, we should be at peace: at peace in the south, at peace in the countryside, safe in our homes and secure in our communities. But we remain at war—at war against terrorism; at war against corruption; at war against disease; at war against drugs—the greatest menace facing our country today.
Last five weeks, we’ve struck a major blow against the drug menace. Eight billion pesos in five weeks. It is a pity that a few days later after the penultimate success against the drug menace, we should find ourselves at war against destabilizers.
We cannot stay divided with so much we need to do together. I address myself not only to the joint houses here assembled, but to the nation-at-large.
I need you; we need each other.
Iyon ang aking sinabi nang naluklok ako bilang pangulo noong 2001. Sinabi ko noon na panahon na ng paghilom sa ating lipunan.
At sa aking unang State of the Nation Address, pinagdiinan ko ang mga batayang hangarin ng karaniwang Pilipino: trabaho, pagkain sa bawat mesa, tahanan, edukasyon.
I gave my targets.
I am submitting to the Congress and to the nation a technical report of my government’s performance. In sum I can say, we delivered in great part on our commitments. Hindi lumampas ang dalawang buwan pagkatapos noong State of the Nation Address, noong 9/11, nagbago ang mundo. sa mga batayang hangaring trabaho, pagkain sa bawat mesa, tahanan, at edukasyon, ating idinagdag ang kapayapaan.
Ngunit dahil hindi pa matatag ang ating republika, hindi pa natin maaasahan na kung ang isang pangulo ay mag-uutos parang isang presidente ng isang korporasyon, ay maiintindihan at susunod kaagad ang mga institusyon at burokrasya. In a nation whose institutions are still fragile, a leader cannot run a developing country like a corporation.
For the practical purposes of most people, government exists to provide jobs, homes, education, peace, food on every table. And to do that adequately and dependably, government must possess the capacity to execute good policy and deliver basic services through strong and responsive institutions staffed by a competent and dedicated bureaucracy. In short, government must be the arm of a strong republic.
But a strong republic does not happen overnight; not even in two or three years. Nor does it happen once and for all.
In this setting, the first virtue of a modern leader is a constant sense of correct perspective, the capacity to retain her original focus, and plod on regardless. She must stick to priorities that were carefully chosen, rather than dump them at every first issue that is recklessly raised. I have stuck to my priorities: jobs, food on every table, homes, education, peace.
Many of our reforms have yet to bear fruit, but in the fullness of time our country will reap what was carefully picked, planted, and nurtured. And it will be a harvest of plenty.
The harvest has in fact started.
Sa kapayaan:
We have hit hard at terrorism and, with the help of Speaker Joe de Venecia, made advances towards a negotiated peace on two fronts: the MILF and the NDF.
Sa susunod na linggo, magsisimula na ang pag-uusap ng peace panels ng gobyerno at MILF tungo sa isang panghuling kasunduang pang-kapayapaan. We will avail of the good offices of Malaysia in the search of a political solution to the conflict with the MILF, while looking to the help of the United States in the rehabilitation of conflict areas and the eradication of the roots of war. We—all of us Filipinos—have to decide now, once and for all, whether we want peace or we want war. There is no way to peace. Peace is the way. Subalit kung ipagpipilitan ng ilang mga kaaway ng ating republika ang digmaan, wala akong magagawa kung hindi tapatan sila upang ipagtanggol ang ating mga kababayan.
I thank the senate for ratifying seven UN conventions against terrorism. I asked them to ratify the remaining five. Hinihingi ko rin sa kongreso na ipasa na ang Anti-Terrorism Law, at isama rito ang pagpataw ng mabigat na parusa sa kapabayaan sa pangangalaga ng mga pinaghihinalaang terorista.
Kasama ng terorismo, ang problema ng droga, ang pinag-uugatan ng matinding pagkabahala ng mga mamamayan tungkol sa kanilang personal na kaligtasan. Ang katiwaliang nilikha ng kalakal sa droga ay malalim ang lagos at bumabagtas sa lahat ng sector. Dapat nating kapootan ang walang pakundangang pagsira sa buhay ng ating mga mamamayan na maaaring humantong sa pagkawasak ng ating mga institusyong demokratiko.
Kapag nakakausap ko ang mga magulang ng mga drug addict, nawawasak ang aking puso, ngunit lalong tumitibay ang loob ko na tama ang aking desisyong itaas ang antas ng ating paglaban sa bawal na gamot. Dadalhin ko ang labang ito sa bawat lalawigan at lungsod hanggang umabot sa mga barangay upang kumatok tayo sa mga pinto ng bawat pamilyang Pilipino. This is one fight I am taking everywhere, if we have to knock on every door. Maglulunsad tayo ng kampanya sa mga paaralan at mga komunidad para sagipin ang kabataan at bigyan ng bagong buhay ang mga drug users at tiyaking hindi sila malulong muli! Pipigain natin ang supply sa kalye sa paraang kahit na ang masalapi ay mahihirapang sustentuhan ang kanilang bisyo. Pipilayan natin ang operasyon ng mga drug lords at ng kanilang mga padrino sa mga pasilyo ng kapangyarihan.
I thank Congress for passing the Anti-Money Laundering Lawbecause it will help us interdict the money of the drug lords. I am now instructing the Secretary of Budget and Management to allocate a hundred million pesos for its implementation.
Ito ang ating laban at tayo ay magtatagumpay. Para sa mga big fish sa ilegal na droga, mahirap na ang mag-moratorium sa death penalty. Ngunit sa ibang bagay, pro-life pa rin ako. I will veto any bill that will try to smuggle in abortion.
Tungkol sa edukasyon:
In 2001, I said that our English literacy gives us a competitive edge in ICT. I also said that to prepare the youth to be the next generation of knowledge workers, we will upgrade math and science teaching in basic education. Kaya dinagdagan natin ang oras para sa math at English at pinag-ibayo ang laman ng science sa bagong curriculum. Nagtayo tayo ng eskwelahan sa 600 barangay na dati’y walang paaralan. Sinisimulan natin ang distance learning program o education TV para sa apat na raang pamayanang malayo at kulang ang guro.
At kagaya ni Senate President Franklin Drilon, samahan n’yo akong magtayo ng silid-aralan sa lahat ng paaralang lumalampas sa 100 mag-aaral bawat silid. In that way, we can once and for all close the perennial school building gap.
Tungkol sa tirahan:
Tayo ay nakapagtayo ng higit 100,000 bahay para sa mga maralita at halos 200,000 para sa mga manggagawa. Binigyan din natin ng katiyakan sa lupang tinitirikan ang halos 300,000 na mahihirap na pamilya. Pinagtibay natin ang ancestral domain ng mga katutubo sa mahigit 360,000 ektarya ng lupain.
Tungkol sa pagkain sa bawat mesa:
Self-rated hunger according to the surveys has gone down to 6.6 percent compared to 12.7 percent just before I became president. Mayroon tayong pirmihang supply ng bigas sa halagang P16.00 bawat kilo para sa mahihirap.
At ayon sa masugid na pag-monitor ni Mar Roxas, ang ating Secretary of Trade, mula noong ako’y naging pangulo, nanatiling P8.50 ang halaga ng pangmasang sardinas, P11.00 ang mantikang lapad, P23.00 ang mantikang long neck, P28.00 ang puting asukal, P23.00 ang brown sugar, P28.00 ang kondensada, P115.00 ang baboy, P90.00 ang manok, at P160.00 ang baka. Matatag itong mga presyo mula nang ako’y naging pangulo. Dahil dito, ngayon pinakamababa ang ating inflation rate sa loob ng 20 taon. Malamang, ito ay dahil ang aking administrasyon sa tulong ng kongreso ay taun-taon gumugugol ng 20 bilyong piso para sa makataong modernisasyon ng agrikultura.
Namahagi tayo ng halos kalahating milyong ektarya sa ilalim ng reporma sa lupa. Mas marami pa tayong magagawa sa 38 bilyong pisong inilaan para dito ng desisyon ng Korte Suprema tungkol sa nakaw na yaman.
I congratulate the Supreme Court for finally granting what has taken much too long to materialize: authorizing the allocation and use of private loot for laudable public purposes.
Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na maglaan ng bahagi nitong pondo bilang kabayaran sa mga naging biktima ng paglabag sa karapatang pantao noong Martial Law.
Mas malaki rin ang maitutulong ng gobyerno sa mga magsasaka ng niyog ngayon na naresolba na pabor sa magsasaka ang kaso ng coco levy. Uulitin ko ang sinabi ko noon pang 2001, sisiguruhin ko na makikinabang sa coco levy ay ang mga maliliit na magniyu-niyog. Hindi ko sila pababayaang madehado.
I said that there could be a million new jobs in agriculture and fisheries. We have provided more than half of that number two-thirds into my term.
Ngunit upang mabuo ang 1 milyon, kailangan isabatas natin ang panukalang gamitin ang bukirin bilang kolateral sa utang para lumawak ang daan sa rural credit at kapital. To the countless incentives that Congress has granted to business, I’ve matched similar programs to give a similar break to the worker in the factory and in the farm.
I do not subscribe to trickle down economics and social policy. Those who have less in life should not have to scramble for crumbs at the feet of those with too much on the table. Bilang pakikipag-ugnayan sa mga pinakamahirap ng ating bansa hinggil sa pinakamalubhang mga problema natin, dinalaw ko ang mga di kilalang barangay.
Nawasak ang aking puso nang narinig kong namatay ang Calisaan quadruplets. Lalong nakumbinsi akong pag-ibayuhin ang mga serbisyong pangkalusugan, gaya nang mabuti nating paglaban sa SARS. Ngayon, ang mga gamot na madalas gamitin ng mahihirap ay nabibili sa kalahating presyo sa mga ospital ng gobyerno.
Sa PhilHealth insurance naman, bago ako naging pangulo, isa’t kalahating milyong maralita ang sakop. Ngayon, halos 7 milyon na. Gusto kong palawakin ang mga ito, ang murang gamot, at dapat hangarin natin na lahat ng dukha ay masakop sa PhilHealth. And to finance the universal coverage of PhilHealth, I ask Congress to pass the bill on the indexation of sin taxes.
Tungkol sa trabaho:
Sinabi ko noong 2001 na upang dumami ang trabaho, kailangang isaayos ang klima para sa pamumuhunan. Our economy grew by 4.4 percent GNP last year and 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year. Only China and Vietnam did better.
Ang kahirapan ay unti-unting nagagapi. Self-rated poverty again according to the survey, is at its lowest percentage of the population in the last 16 years. Foreign investments rose 26 percent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. But we need to reduce the risk of living, not to mention doing business here, which is why yesterday’s rogues must go to jail.
We can reduce business costs by providing basic infrastructure: roads, transport, and a more efficient and rationalized power sector. Our road program is symbolized by the long-awaited expansion of the North Expressway.
On mass transport, towards the end of this year, we will complete the loop of the light railway system of Metro Manila—from Santolan in Pasig towards Aurora Boulevard in Cubao, and on to Quiapo to Blumentritt on to EDSA in Pasay and back to Cubao. Hindi tumaas ang pasahe mula noong una kong State of the Nation Address. Kaya mga jeepney drivers, nagpapasalamat ako; hindi ko kayo pababayaan.
To reduce transport costs from Mindanao to Luzon, we set up the nautical highway, a system where the cargo truck itself travels straight to its destination, making inter-island crossings on ferries, rather than loading and unloading at every port. This has reduced by 30 percent the transport costs of products from Mindanao like copra, rice, corn, and vegetables.
Nagbigay tayo ng kuryente sa mahigit 3,600 barangay. While in Metro Manila, a consumer using 100 kilowatt hour paid P526.48 last May. Today, he pays P423.20, a drop of over 100 pesos or 20 percent. His case is one of almost 2 million households benefiting from the lifeline rate program of the Energy Regulatory Commission. Another 119 electric cooperative franchise areas will also soon reduce their rates under the loan condonation program of the Electric Power Reform Act that you, Congress, passed in 2001. That is why, believe me when I say that from having the second most expensive power in Asia Pacific, we now rank seventh.
But we will need 6,000 megawatts more of power over the next 10 years. That is why we need to pass the Transco Bill to maintain a favorable ranking as we take on this added capacity. When we reduce business costs, the last should be wages, and the first should be red tape.
Kaya nagsasagawa ako ng sorpresang pagbisita sa mga tanggapan ng gobyerno, upang pasiglahin ang talagang nagsisikap at gisingin kung sino ang natutulog sa trabaho. Pinalakas natin ang pambansang ekonomiya—agrikultura, maliliit na negosyo, pabahay—upang anumang mangyari sa dayuhang ekonomiya, matatag pa rin ang Pilipinas.
Naglaan tayo ng 10 bilyong piso para sa murang pautang sa maliliit na negosyo. Nagamit na ito, kaya dadagdagan muli natin ng higit pa sa 10 bilyon.
Ang interest rates ay patuloy na bumababa. Good monetary policy and fiscal discipline and balance are the key. Our revenues surpassed the target by 21 billion pesos in the first five months of this year, driven by information technology, and helped by lifestyle checks, and 50 indictments and dismissals for graft and corruption. Thus, we held the budget deficit in check at 22 percent below ceiling.
I thank Congress for passing our e-Procurement Law because it helps us hold down expenditures. Now, I ask Congress to complete the passage of the bills on excise tax rationalization and the national revenue authority. But we must reduce corruption not only among appointive but also among elective officials.
With full financial support to my government, the registration, counting, and transmission of votes in the May 2004 elections will be completely computerized. Now, I ask congress to institute reforms in campaign finance to level the playing field and widen the choice of the electorate for worthy candidates. The strength of our investment climate also rests in great part on the realities of the global and regional environment and on how we turn those realities to our advantage.
Our country has come much closer to reattaining its strategic importance in geopolitics as an active and respected voice in international affairs. The Filipino is now recognized as a truly global worker, both at home and abroad. We have had the smallest number of strikes in the last 21 years. Increasingly, the Philippines is being recognized as an ideal site for critical operations requiring a high-quality, English-educated workforce. Eight million Filipinos live and work abroad, in jobs where they enjoy the unbeatable comparative advantages of an English-speaking education, advanced skills, and a uniquely caring nature.
The Filipino will work anywhere because he is not afraid. Like Manny Pacquiao, given the chance to compete, he will take it and he will win. It was only fitting that because of your work in Congress, overseas Filipino workers were given the overseas voting right. It was also fitting that I put in a new perspective on our relations with the United States, where three million Filipinos live and where I made a visit as their only state visitor for the year. The benefits of our engagement with the U.S. vastly outweigh any concerns about sovereign subordination. We should have the confidence to deal with other countries as equals—however rich, however strong, be they China, Japan, the members of the European Union or the United States.
We have reached out to good friends and neighbors—such as Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia and President Megawati of Indonesia—with the message that we must work together especially where democracy and security are concerned.
Ang panguluhan ay laging nahaharap sa mabibigat na suliranin. Terrorism, drugs, SARS, OFWs, Mindanao, poverty, corruption, investments, destabilization—these come to mind as we review the crises and opportunities of the past year. They sum up the problems we faced and the extraordinary responses that we made, surprising even ourselves and reviving faith in our future.
Barangay Vacante, Alcala, Pangasinan, got the SARS, took the hit, fought on, and valiantly overcame the crisis. Barangay Inug-ug, Pagalungan, Maguindanao, politely asked the MILF and the military to leave and take their fight elsewhere, thereby making their community a sanctuary of peace.
Si Sonny Ayao, umayaw sa giyera at naging community organizer kahit na s’ya ay naging MNLF sa edad na 12, at pagkatapos maging Mujahideen sa loob ng 27 taon.
The Filipinos of Kuwait, isolated by war but refusing to abandon their jobs, took care of themselves and the people around them during the Iraq conflict. Teacher Josette Biyo of Iloilo, world champion in science and math teaching, has a planet in the solar system named after her. Luz Lozada, 72 years old, ng San Isidro, Davao del Sur—hinirang na natatanging magsasaka. She is the image model of hybrid rice technology, the symbol of our agricultural modernization. Police officers Cayetano Gannaban and Raul Graza fought off 20 rebels in a firefight in Quinapondan, Eastern Samar. Police Colonel Boysie Rosales, kilabot ng mga drug lords, tumanggi sa suhol na P35 million. Hinahangaan ko ang gilas ng maraming Pilipino, ang malalim nating kaban ng kabayanihan at talino, ang ating matibay na kalooban upang mabuhay, maglingkod, at mangibabaw.
Ang ating pangarap ay walang kabawas-bawas—isang matatag na republikang hindi matitinag ng makasariling interes, yumayabong sa mga gumaganang institusyon ng pamamahala, naglilingkod sa isang masipag na lipi saan man ito kailangan upang maibigay sa kanila ang karapat-dapat nilang tanggapin.
A life of leadership is a difficult one, with few pauses for comfort and relief. These days, I find that rare moment of joy in the company of my family—especially my granddaughter, Mikaela. Just as I will do everything to make sure that the future will be kind to Mikaela and her generation, so must we all strive to turn our fears into a resolve to do right not just by ourselves, but by our children and grandchildren.
Nasa giyera tayo. giyera laban sa terorismo. giyera laban sa katiwalian. giyera laban sa kasakitan. giyera laban sa droga. giyera laban sa destabilisasyon. Sa ating sama-samang pakikipaglaban at pagtutulungan, tayo ay mangingibabaw at magwawagi.
No agtutunos tayo nga agtrabaho, agba leygi tayo.
Abe-abeng makilaban ampon mag-obra, mangibabo tamu.
Sa atong panaghiusa sa pagtrabaho ug pagbuntog sa mga kaaway, molampos gayod kita.
Sa aton pag-inupod sa mga ulubrahon kag sa pakipag-away, kita gid ang magpangibabaw.
Kasihan nawa ng Diyos ang Pilipinas.
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat.

Fourth State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 1st Regular Session of the 13th Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 26, 2004]
Thank you Speaker De Venecia; Vice President Noli de Castro; President Fidel Ramos; Senate President Drilon; Chief Justice Davide and the Justices of the Supreme Court; honorable members of the Senate and the House of Representatives; His Excellency Archbishop Franco and the excellencies of the diplomatic corps; members of the Cabinet; commanders of the Armed Forces; officers and members of the Philippine National Police; fellow workers in government; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen.
Angelo de la Cruz is home.
We did it! Congratulations to the Filipino people. [Applause]
Samakatuwid, ipabatid sa lahat, mula sa pook at panahong ito, sa bawat Pilipino, saan man naroroon…
You have a government—indeed, you have a country—that cares. Your life is held more dearly than international acclaim. [Applause] And you have a President who is your friend. [Applause]
Why was Angelo de la Cruz saved? Because I stuck to my oath. Since I first became President in 2001, my declared foreign policy focus has been to protect the vital interests of the nation, including our 8 million overseas Filipinos.
And I cannot apologize for being a protector of my people. [Applause]
The difference of a few weeks, for a pullout already decided on, could not justify sacrifice of a human life.
Sacrificing Angelo de la Cruz would have been a pointless provocation; it would have put the lives of a million and a half Filipinos in the Middle East at risk, by making them part of the war.
Wars are for combatants. As I speak soldiers are being held hostage by communist insurgents, but they don’t expect to be released except by the compassion of their captors or a military operation.
We have been fighting the longest-running communist insurgency in history. We have been coming to grips with fundamentalist terrorism long before 9/11.
As the leader of the nation, I say in behalf of the Filipino people to the world: We are strong and principled believers in democracy. Four generations of fighting Filipinos have ceaselessly struggled against totalitarians and terrorists for our freedom, for the freedom of our people and the people of the world.
We have fought the enemy, and taken as good as we gave—not from a safe distance but in close quarters. Bataan and Corregidor, Korea and Vietnam, East Timor, Kosovo, Liberia, to name a few.
When I opted to save Angelo de la Cruz, I was reflecting whether one life should be sacrificed for no pressing reason or saved by accelerating an ongoing pullout.
I did not sacrifice policy to save a human life. I applied policy for that purpose. [Applause] The Philippines has no policy that demands sacrifice of human lives.
Ask yourselves this: If Angelo de la Cruz had been sacrificed, what would change for the better in Iraq today?
Having saved one Filipino from a painful and pointless death, we must seize the unity we attained to improve our government and save our economy. [Applause]
Pinapangako ko ang isang bagong direksyon: mamamayan muna. Ang taong bayan ang pinakamalaki nating yaman. Ngunit madalas, kaunti lang ang atensyon na binibigay sa kanilang pag-unlad. Di tuloy matawid ang agwat ng mayaman at mahirap. Di tuloy mapa-abot sa lahat ang biyaya ng demokrasya.
I want to create economic opportunity at home and abroad. I don’t want just one or the other. I want both.
But it can only be done with focus, with energy, and with a common purpose to do that which still lies within our power: put our economic house back in working order [applause] before it finds itself beyond hope of repair and doomed to share the fate of failed nations.
We made a head start in the last three years; we must take bolder steps forward in the next six.
Inflation is under control. The ordinary housewife has been buying her rice and fish at stable prices.
New investments, foreign and, better yet, domestic, were made. Three million more of our people found jobs in the last three years compared to half a million in the three years before that.
Malaki ang pag-unlad sa pangunahing pangangailangan—malinis na tubig, health insurance, tirahan, paaralan, aklat.
We beat down crime, we are breaking up the drug and kidnapping syndicates, we are mopping up the stragglers. The people are safer in the streets, in their homes, and in their places of work.
Every government in the world is at war with its own corruption; we have made lifestyle checks a lethal weapon, and adopted procurement reforms to take the fight forward.
Thanks to many of you, I emerged from the last election with more votes than any previous president. [Applause]
As a further sign of the people’s overwhelming support, they gave me a huge majority in Congress, and and a huge majority among the local governments.
This is a new day, with a new direction, and a renewed confidence in what we can achieve together.
I am determined to prove that this tremendous show of faith and confidence is well deserved.
The season of bitter partisanship is over; the season of service is upon us all—majority, minority, opposition, administration.
In my inaugural address, I laid down a 10-point agenda for the next six years—not utopia but something practical we can achieve and accomplish on time.
What I did promise was that my term would be the irreversible turning point.
Ipinangangako ko—iiwanan na natin ang ligalig at alinlangan.
At the end of my term, the question will not longer be whether we can compete but where else in the world shall we take an indisputable competitive advantage.
The next six years, we hope, is when we finally get things right.
Is there something about that goal we cannot all agree on? Is there a reason we cannot all work together?
All that’s needed is to clear away a couple of obstacles, as I intend to do with five key reform packages: (1) job creation through economic growth; (2) anticorruption through good government; (3) social justice and basic needs; (4) education and youth opportunity; and (5) energy independence and savings.
Tough decisions will have to be made. It’s going to be tough love from hereon. It must be tougher on those who’ve had it easy than on those who’ve had it tough already.
Humarap din sa problema ang mga karatig bansa.
Ang kanilang sikreto’y pagkakaisa ng mamamayan, suporta sa liderato, at sakripisyo ng bawat isa.
We must bear the pain and share the pain to enjoy the gain together.
Those with more must sacrifice more; those with less are already living lives of self-sacrifice.
Maraming magsasabi: matagal na silang nagsasakripisyo. Ngunit hinihingi ko sa inyo: konti pang sakripisyo.
We must wait with patience for the reforms to work. In the meantime, we must work more productively because world competition is keen and we want the jobs not only to come, but to stay.
Our most urgent problem is the budget deficit. Sometimes it’s unavoidable; but chronic deficits are always bad.
Sometimes stamping out deficits too vigorously can slow down growth. But ignoring them can kill the economy. It sends the wrong signal that we don’t understand our fiscal predicament and will not help ourselves. This will drive away investments, exacerbate the deficit, and hurt job growth.
Chronic deficits drastically reduce government’s ability to make those infrastructure investments that business needs to grow and create jobs.
Chronic deficits mean undertaking less social services that private charity will never provide but without which social war is inevitable. This is a surefire formula for national failure.
So, we must raise revenues, expand government services, yet cut costs—all at the same time. It boils down to right priorities.
The beauty of the fiscal problem is that all the solutions are known, though applying the right ones is tricky.
All the solutions require: toughness on the part of government, cooperation on the part of business, patience on the part of our people, and active support on the part of Congress.
All the solutions require profound, even personal, changes. Politicians will need to focus on the job at hand rather than on their prospect of re-election.
The worst offender yet the hardest to pin down is corporate corruption. Businessmen must adopt an attitude of tax acceptance not tax avoidance. They must stop trying to outrun the tax collector. They must recognize that only a fiscally stronger government can create a more congenial business environment: [applause] greater security, better infrastructure, cheaper credit, more business.
My administration will undertake reforms to raise or save P100 billion. [Applause] I ask Congress to pass eight revenue measures that will collect P80 billion more.
Alam kong maaasahan ko ang mga mambabatas upang burahin ang deficit, upang ituloy ang magandang trabaho, at upang itaguyod ang saligan ng matapat na gobyerno at malakas na ekonomiya.
Investments in infrastructure and energy provide the greatest multiplier effect for growth and job creation. ‘Pag maganda ang imprastraktura gaya ng kalsada, tulay, pantalan, telepono, kuryente, maraming mamumuhunan. Maraming magkakaroon ng trabaho.
We must achieve sufficient, efficient, cheap energy in the near term. We must be sure to have the capacity to meet the demands of a growing economy, so as not to choke off growth when it comes, and thereby lose the opportunities that may not come again.
To this end, NAPOCOR power-generating plants and transmission lines must be privatized but not in a fire sale. [Applause] Delivering electricity to virtually an entire country as big as ours cannot possibly be worth nothing but the trouble of running it.
NAPOCOR’s transmission systems will be sold on terms that recognize the lucrative monopoly of its transmission grid. I ask Congress to pass the Transco bill that already passed the House in the 12th Congress. [Applause]
Our investments in social justice and basic needs are as vital to our future as fiscal and macroeconomic reforms. A nation deeply divided will not stand. And it certainly will not move forward.
Our nation is divided by social and economic faultlines. The tectonic plates may shift with unthinkable consequences.
Some say that is it cheaper to die than to get well from an illness, that it is impossible to find clean water in this rainfall country, that in this modern day and age, part of the country still sits in darkness. This is a terrible waste and a terrible shame.
Kaya ang aking agenda para sa maralita ay hanapbuhay; reporma sa lupa; tubig, gamot, at kuryente; pagtatanggol at kapangyarihan para sa mahina.
In fact, we will now be able to bring clean water to the entire country because during my previous term, you, Congress finally passed the Clean Water Act; because in my first days as president in 2001 I signed the Solid Waste Act—thank you also for giving me that opportunity—and because we are reforesting our watersheds.
The place to start now is livelihood, for 10 million Filipinos.
The growing industrial, service, and microenterprise sectors will take care of some, a thriving agribusiness sector will keep more in the countryside rather than burdening a Metro Manila that is already cracking under the weight of overpopulation.
Land reform covers agrarian reform, urban land reform, and ancestral domain land reform. I ask Congress to qualify farmland as bank collateral and reform the system of urban land titles.
Ang kapangyarihan ng taong bayan ay puso ng demokrasya. Dapat kasama sila sa paghugis ng kanilang kapalaran.
Dadalhin ko ang aking mga reporma sa taong bayan. Ako’y magpapaliwanag, ako’y makikinig.
I have shown that government does care even for a single Filipino life. Now we must show that we care for the rest of the Filipino people, especially the weakest among us. [Applause]
To adapt the words of Adam Smith to the information age, “The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labor seems to have been the effects of a modern education.”
Economies have exhausted the possibilities of the division of labor; the way further forward now is a better-educated, more adaptable workforce.
We need to start early. And we need to maintain the highest educational standards. I ask Congress to legislate an extra year of studies not by adding a fifth year of high school but by standardizing what is taught in the barangay day care centers. [Applause]
To expand youth opportunity, we need to focus on technical and vocational education; on strengthening English, Science and Technology, and love of country. [Applause] As I said in my inaugural: It is not free markets but patriotism that makes countries strong. [Applause]
There is a sense in which as a society we have failed the youth in their formative years, in growing up normally and productively, in getting a good education, in learning the habits of honesty and citizenship and civic discipline.
I ask the educational system, the parents, the church, and pillars of the community to help shape a new culture of honesty, patriotism, respect, discipline, and service for young Filipinos. [Applause]
The roof cannot collapse when the value pillars of government and society are sound and strong.
I fervently support the judicial reforms being carried out by our Supreme Court. [Applause]
I ask Congress for a law making the ombudsman’s function as effective as Hong Kong’s independent commission against corruption. [Applause]
Bureaucratic corruption with its numerous leakages is bad. So is government incompetence. Unlike in the private sector, where the free market punishes mistakes, government incompetence punishes only the public.
We have to tear away layers of inefficiency piled on by decades of political accommodation: redundancy in the national service, waste in local governments, and pointless procedures for getting done what isn’t needed anyway to secure the public welfare. Just how does paying off the health inspector banish bacteria from a dirty kitchen? [Applause]
By definition, public services are what the private sector will not do except for a price the public cannot pay.
Where the private sector can do it better and cheaper, government may have to step aside. [Applause] But the watchwords are better and cheaper. Where privatization only spells public pillage, government will continue to do the work. [Applause]
But that’s no reason to spare public services from the test of competitive performance.
We will simplify procedures to eliminate fixers.
We will downsize the government, motivate excess employees to become entrepreneurs, and increase the pay of a lean and mean bureaucracy. [Applause]
I have abolished 80 offices under the Office of the President. I will abolish 30 more.
I ask Congress to pass a law on government reengineering, with silver parachutes for redundant offices.
Once we have proved to our people that we have done what we can within the present structure of government, we can move on to changing the system to one that enhances our freedom and flexibility to do more.
I expect that next year, Congress will start considering the resolutions for charter change. [Applause]
No one has a monopoly on right ideas. I am reaching out to all segments of society and all parties, be they with me or against me, to join me in those things that should be everyone’s concern because they rise above politics to the level of patriotism. [Applause]
I do not want a honeymoon period after which we can forget the country and go after each other again. I want a marriage not of convenience but of conviction, across the spectrum of parties and groups, encompassing the range of intelligent political, religious, and economic views. [Applause] I want a marriage for at least the life of this Congress. [Applause]
I do not ask for unprincipled support because it will not hold.
I do ask for an end to unprincipled obstructionism because that always succeeds in defeating our best efforts. [Applause]
Tunay nga na kahirapan at kawalan ng katarungan ang sagabal sa ating pag-unlad. Ngunit ang mga nagsusulsol sa mahihirap para manggulo ang sumisira sa ating kinabukasan. [Applause]
So this must stop.
We must put a stop to that.
Every year, every President tells Congress that it is the last chance for meaningful change.
This time I will say it again, adding only that past presidents were right. And that each time change doesn’t happen, makes change harder and less likely to happen the next time around.
The time for change is well past due.
This time, let me say, let’s just do it!
Mabuhay ang Pilipino!
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat. [Applause] [Standing ovation]
Mabuhay ang Pilipino! Mabuhay!

Fifth State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 2nd Regular Session of the 13th Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 25, 2005]
Thank you.
Thank you, Speaker de Venecia.
Vice President de Castro; President Ramos; Senate President Drilon and the members of the Senate; members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Davide and the members of the judiciary; Archbishop Franco and the excellencies of the diplomatic corps; fellow government workers whether elected, appointed, or civil servants; distinguished guests; ladies and gentlemen:
Every year, we meet on this day in this great hall to celebrate democracy and take stock of the nation: the country and its condition; the government and its performance; the people and their well-being.
Ours is a country divided; the story of our nation is a tale of two Philippines; almost, as it were, two countries under the same name.
One is the Philippines whose economy, after long years of cumulative national endeavor, is now poised for take off. The other is the Philippines whose political system, after equally long years of degeneration, has become a hindrance to progress.
As a country on the verge of take off, our storyline would surprise many at home and abroad. The story includes an economy that grew more than 6% last year and that has continued to work in the teeth of the biggest oil price hikes in history, while generating 4 million jobs in the last four years. [Applause]
The story includes marked improvements in tax collections, infrastructure, housing construction, shelter security for the urban poor and indigenous peoples, and rice productivity. [Applause]
The story includes 69 million beneficiaries of health care insurance, including 30 million indigents, whose re-enrollment started early this year and is still ongoing. [Applause]
That same story, over four years, saw the drug menace cut in half, the rash of kidnappings become a thing of the past, and insurgency in the south abated.
This story should work itself out as one about an economy as resilient and full of potential as its people are patient and hardworking, guided by a government–with the executive and the legislative hand-in-hand—that is able to pass a no-nonsense budget and make the tough decisions to put our fiscal house in order. [Applause]
I especially refer to our recent titanic struggle to enact the three laws that comprised the biggest fiscal package in our history, the biggest revenue increase in a generation that will break the vicious cycle of financing development by borrowing and having to borrow again just to service those loans. This is the one reform that will snap the chain that has bound our future to a profligate past and the debt-burdened present. [Applause] The Filipino’s strong sense of family has given Congress a stronger resolve not to pass on today’s debt, and bankrupt our children and grandchildren tomorrow. That struggle has done the House and the Senate great honor. Congratulations to you. [Applause]
Abroad, the story continues. We’ve worked long and hard to restore our country to the prominent place it once held as cofounder of the United Nations and the free world’s first line of defense in the east. We won a seat in the UN security council, where we presided over the landmark resolution calling for democracy in Iraq. The Philippines chaired the historic conference on interfaith cooperation for peace at the UN, the fruit of a bold and creative initiative by your Speaker of the House. [Applause]
We head the APEC antiterrorism task force. Our victories in the war on terror have been acknowledged by no less than President Bush before the U.S. National Defense University. The Jemaah Islamiya and the Abu Sayyaf can only pick up the pieces of its broken backbone in Mindanao.
We’ve worked with the Organization of the Islamic Conference to forge peace with our Muslim brothers. Eighty percent of our peace talks with them have been completed. [Applause] Permanent peace in Mindanao is within reach. [Applause]
Indeed, our story as a country on the verge of take off is real. Analysts need only to look at our stock market, and even the peso-dollar exchange rate, to sense the strong anticipation of significant improvements, if only we would overcome the tendency to be our own worst enemy. [Applause]
Thus, with investors both here and abroad in mind, I invite you all to join me in sending them a strong message from this great hall: We will not waver in our commitment to economic reform and fiscal discipline, whatever the political cost. [Applause]
The other message to send is that we will address the burden that the other Philippine story imposes on our anticipated take off. I refer to the story of how our political system has now become a hindrance to our national progress.
Over the years, our political system has degenerated to the extent that it is difficult for anyone to make any headway yet keep his hands clean. To be sure, the system is still capable of achieving great reforms. But, by and large, our political system has betrayed its promise to each new generation of Filipinos, not a few of whom are voting with their feet, going abroad, and leaving that system behind.
Perhaps we politicians have done our best; but maybe our best is not enough, given the present system. Perhaps we have strained the present political system to its final limit.
It is time to turn to the people, bring them into government, and change the way that government is done. [Applause]
The people want government that works for them at every level. They want good government that begins at their doorstep in the barangay, and does not end before the closed door of a bureaucrat in Metro Manila. [Applause]
The system clearly needs fundamental change, and the sooner the better. [Applause] It’s time to start the great debate on charter change. [Applause]
We must address such questions as how much more government is needed for the greater safety and economic security of our people, and how much less government is more conducive to free enterprise and economic progress.
The mode of charter change is the exclusive prerogative of Congress. But a constituent assembly may well give our people the quickest reforms. [Applause]
I shall work with Congress, civil society groups, and local government executives [applause] who are convinced that charter changes are needed to enable the country to surmount the unprecedented challenges of the 21st century. [Applause]
I take this opportunity to acknowledge the local government executives [applause] who have brought about an LGU power revolution through transformative leadership. [Applause]
The economic progress and social stability of the provinces, along with the increasing self-reliance and efficiency of political developments and public services there, make a compelling case for federalism. [Applause]
Perhaps it’s time to take the power from the center to the countryside that feeds it. [Applause]
I recognize that our form of government will be the decision of the body constituted to undertake charter change. But we should consider that legislation could be quickened and laws made more responsive to the people under a parliamentary system, similar to that [applause] of our progressive neighbors in the region.
But even as we make a serious start in charter change, I hope we can still work together on other initiatives to the lasting benefit of our people. [Applause]
In the area of education, we’ve spent our increased resources on better-trained teachers in more classrooms, teaching students in more effective ways. We’ve laid a strong foundation by building almost 30,000 classrooms in the past four years, providing computer access to more than 3,000 high schools, and beginning a “healthy start” breakfast program for our young schoolchildren. [Applause]
I ask congress to pass the Pre-Need Code to rehabilitate, reform and regulate the pre-need educational programs that worked so well in the past as a major vehicle for youth education entitlement. [Applause]
College education is the great Filipino dream. But in a world of rapid technological change, getting a job or keeping it depends as much on how well one reasons as how well one uses his hands. I have issued E.O. 358 so that hours spent in vocational training can be credited towards a college degree. [Applause] That will combine job readiness with the dream of a college education while increasing the competitiveness of our nation.
But our competitiveness is greatly endangered today by the global oil crisis. I call on Congress to pass legislation encouraging renewable and indigenous energy. [Applause]
In the area of national security, I urge the swift passage of an antiterrorism law that will protect rather than subvert, enhance rather than weaken, the rights and liberties that terrorism precisely threatens with extinction. [Applause]
These examples serve to highlight that there is much work to be done.
Now is not the time for divisiveness, and while there’s no avoiding partisan politics, there can be a determined effort by all sides to limit the collateral damage on a country poised for take-off. [Applause]
Let’s call on the Lord to lead us. Let us ask him for the grace to make us worthy of his healing our land.
Alam kong tayong lahat ay naghahangad ng isang makabuluhang pagbabago para sa ating bayan. Tayong lahat ay nagsisikap para matamo ang kapayapaan at kaunlaran. Kung kaya’t ako’y nakikiusap na tulungan ninyo ako, para sa kapakanan ng ating bayan. [Applause]
We may disagree among ourselves but let us never lose sight of that greater battle for one people, one country, one Philippines. [Applause]
Not the country of this or that president but the Philippines of our shared and passionate affections. [Applause]
Maraming salamat sa inyong lahat. [Applause] [Standing ovation]
Thank you.

Sixth State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 13th Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 24, 2006]
Thank you.
Thank you, Speaker de Venecia. Congratulations, Senate President Manny Villar; Vice President Noli de Castro; President Ramos; Chief Justice Panganiban; Members of the diplomatic corps; senators; congressmen and congresswomen; other officials, ladies and gentlemen.
Sa araw na ito, nakatuon ang isip natin sa ating mga kababayan sa Lebanon. Nasa kuko sila ngayon ng malagim na paglala ng digmaan. Kahapon lamang, sinalubong natin ang unang 200 na Pilipinong lumikas doon; 500 pa ang mauuwi natin sa susunod na apat na araw.
Sa ating mga OFW, tunay kayong mga bagong bayani. Sa inyong paglilingkod sa pamilya, sa ating bayan, at sa Diyos, maraming salamat.
Sa ating mga kababayan, a journey of a thousand miles does not begin with a single step. It starts with the first step, with gathering the means to complete it successfully. Those means are now at hand.
To my friends in Congress who, in the face of grave political consequences, championed and passed some of the most severe and critical fiscal reforms to save our economy, maraming salamat. You are the true friends of the Filipino people. For the real challenge has never been to blame but to fix what is wrong in our country and our economy.
Dahil sa inyo, sa wakas may pondo na tayo, hindi lamang para ibayad sa interes, kundi para sa edukasyon, mas mabuting tulay at kalsada, pagbigay kalinga sa kalusugan at higit na trabaho sa ating bansa. Now, we have the money to pay down our debt and to build up our country.
To the civil servants who rose to the challenge of turning a weakening economy to a strong republic, through more vigorous tax collection and more vigilant action against corruption, maraming salamat. We have achieved record revenue collections. We are lining up corrupt officials to face the consequences of their misdeeds. And finally earned the respect of the international community as a serious and viable state for our fiscal discipline and billions of pesos in annual interest savings that are now going into necessary public investments.
To our men and women in the armed services, the huge and deep core of your loyalty has earned the nation’s accolade. The few mutineers have been condemned by the people. They and their partisan cohorts and funders are being brought to justice. Sa nakararaming kawal at pulis na nagtaguyod ng watawat at Saligang Batas, maraming salamat.
And at a time when we must each, as individuals and as communities, take greater responsibility, our local government officials man the frontline of change: change for greater accountability, for better service, and more responsiveness to their constituents. Sa inyong lahat, mga local government officials, maraming salamat.
Higit sa lahat, salamat sa sambayanang Pilipino, para sa inyong mga sakripisyo, sa inyong tiyaga, for believing, in the face of the greatest hardships, in our ability to surmount the obstacles to the future you deserve; you who have resisted persistent if not pathetic calls for despair instead of faith, for anarchy instead of harmony, salamat, salamat, taos-pusong pasasalamat.
So I stand before you today to deliver a state of the nation that is focused on what the people want; the people want to know the plan to put us on the path to prosperity.
I am not here to talk about politics; I am here to talk about what the people want; details on the state of the nation and what their government is doing to make progress every single day.
Sama-sama nating isusulong ang bansa patungo sa kinabukasang nagniningning.
Gaya ng nakikita sa graph na ito, dahil sa ating reporma sa ekonomiya, we now have the funds to address social inequity and economic disparity. Too many, masyadong marami, ang mamamayang nagugutom. Hindi ako hihinto hanggang magtagumpay ang ating laban sa kahirapan.
We now have the funds to stamp out terrorism and lawless violence.
May pondo na tayo para labanan ang katiwalian.
Our reforms have earned us P1 billion from the U.S. Millennium Challenge Account for more investigators, prosecutors, and new technology to fight corruption. We are matching this with another billion from our fiscal savings.
We now have the funds for constitutional and electoral changes. Sa kasalukuyang sistema, napakabagal ng proseso, at bukas sa labis na pagtutunggali, at sikil ang lalawigan at mamamayan sa paghahari ng Imperial Manila. Panahon nang ibalik ang kapangyarihan sa taumbayan at lalawigan. For surely, there must be a better way to do politics, so that those who lose elections do not make the country pay for their frustrated ambitions. There must be a better way so that those who win the nation’s mandate to govern can work without delay and whimsical obstruction. There must be a better way.
Meanwhile, now we can fund the Medium Term Public Investment Program. Sumusulong na ang ating plano na may tatlong yugto. Una, ang makaahon sa mga dekada ng utang at kapos ng pondo. Nagawa na natin ito. Ikalawang yugto, ang pagbabalik sa taumbayan ng mas malaking kita ng pamahalaan: upang makapagpundar ng kalinga sa kalusugan, edukasyon, at trabaho na kailangang-kailangan ng mamamayan. Ginagawa na rin natin ito. And finally, phase three: to invest in the natural advantages and natural resources of each section of our nation so that when harnessed together, the major economic regions of the nation are larger than the sum of its parts.
We will enhance the competitive advantage of the natural “super regions”of the Philippines: the North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle, the Metro Luzon Urban Beltway, Central Philippines, Mindanao, and the Cyber Corridor.
In North Luzon, we will prioritize agribusiness investments. The agricultural and fisheries potential of the Cordilleras, Ilocandia, and Cagayan Valley can feed Luzon affordably. And nearness to North Asia holds the rich promise of agricultural exports and tourism.
My father built the Halsema Highway from Baguio to Bontoc, and the Bagabag airport in Nueva Vizcaya to access the Ifugao rice terraces, which by the way, the UNESCO has recently praised for the way we have carried out our heritage preservation policy. We have rehabilitated the Baguio to Mount Data leg of the highway and the rest of Halsema will now follow. We will upgrade the Bagabag airport and build a new one in Lallo, Cagayan, which will connect to Cordillera by upgrading the Tabuk-Tuguegarao Road.
Sa Tabuk, Kalinga, noong Abril, tumanggap ng titulo sa lupa ang ilang matatanda, pagkatapos nilang naghintay ng 20 taon mula noong napirmahan ang Mount Data Accord ng gobyerno at ng Cordillera People’s Liberation Army. May isang matanda, suot ang lumang uniporme ng CPLA. Pumila, hila-hila ang isang binatilyo. Sabi niya, “This is not for me but for him.” Agad inabot ang titulo sa apo. Narito ngayon si Ginoong Ama Balunggay at ang kaniyang apo si Jacob.
And our postharvest support shall continue, like the cold chain that we set up in 2004 for La Trinidad, Benguet, under Mayor Nestor Fongwan. It consisted of a refrigerated storage facility and refrigerated trucks to deliver vegetables to Metro Manila. Nais kong tumaas ang kita ng mga magsasaka, at ang ina ng bawat tahanan ay makabili ng mura at sariwang gulay para sa kaniyang mga anak.
So that the people will know how well their money is spent, Benguet and its towns of Bakun, Bokod, and Itogon have rolled out the new electronic government accounting system in their jurisdictions.
Ifugao was able to cut its poverty in half in the first three years of our administration, from 56% to 28%. Congratulations. We hope that through these programs, the other provinces can replicate the success of Ifugao. Hangad nating dumami ang mga taga-Cordillera sa mga propesyon na tinitingalaan ng bayan, gaya ng mga abogadong sina Maurice Domogan at Romeo Brawner. Ibig din nating makapaghanda ang Cordillera sa awtonomiya pagdating ng pederalismo, ayon nawa sa pagbabago ng Saligang Batas.
Sa Dagupan, inilunsad na ng mga kolehiyo gaya ng Northwestern Lyceum University ang ladderized system of education. Sa ganitong sistema, magagamit sa unibersidad and mga kursong kinuha sa vocational school at ang karanasan sa trabaho.
We will expand President Ramos’ flagship San Roque Multipurpose Dam with the massive Agno River Project. Another major project is the Banaoang Irrigation. We allocate P200 million a month for small irrigation projects like those in the flood control plan of the Region II Development Council headed by Bishop Ramon Villena. Plus another P200 million a month for farm-to-market roads.
Also in the works is an international airport in Poro, La Union, and the improvement of the two airports in Batanes as recommended by Governor Vic Gato. Ilocos Sur will have a seaport in Salomague, while the Cagayan Zone Authority will better the one in Port Irene.
To save dollars, windmills in Batanes and Ilocos Norte turn megawinds into megawatts. When Army Commander Romy Tolentino was North Luzon commander, he became a soldier-farmer, planting jatropha as yet another alternative fuel.
The Metro Luzon Urban Beltway spans most of Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Mindoro, and Marinduque. It must be a globally competitive urban, industrial, and services center because it produces more than half of the country’s GDP.
To be world-class we invest in five comprehensive strategies for global competitiveness: (1) Make food plentiful and affordable to keep our labor cost globally competitive; (2) Reduce the cost of electricity to make our factories regionally competitive; (3) Modernize infrastructure at least cost to efficiently transport goods and people; (4) Mobilize, upgrade, and disseminate knowledge and technologies for productivity; and (5) Reduce red tape in all agencies to cut business costs.
The most prohibitive red tape is in our outmoded Constitution. We need Constitutional change to bring our rules of investment into the new millennium.
The new public bidding process has been shortened to 45 days for infrastructure, and 26 days for supplies, as of today. Even before this, Metro Manila firms paying bribes for public contracts declined from 57% in 2003 to 46% today. Congratulations, Metro Manila.
Machine-readable electronic passports will enhance the credibility of Philippine travel documents, improve the mobility, and increase the prospects of Philippine business and labor.
Legitimate mobility is hampered by human trafficking. Through the support of the USAID, we have convicted human traffickers with the Tongco spouses who were sentenced in a Quezon City court last December. These accomplishments removed us from the from the priority antitrafficking watchlist.
To lower power costs we introduced the Wholesale Electricity Spot Market last month. Let’s give it a chance to work. And we would like big power consumers like electronics, our number one export, to avail of lower power rates from the National Power Corporation. On coco-biodiesel, we now have enough capacity for the proposed 1% blend just waiting to be passed into law.
The Subic-Clark corridor is on its way to a competitive international logistics center. This will be my legacy to my cabalens, jointly with Lito and Mark Lapid, Rey Aquino, Ana Bondoc, Blue Boy Nepomuceno, my son Mikey and Tarzan Lazatin. We jumpstarted it with giant investments in the Subic Seaport, the Clark Airport, and the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway.
And to bring the beltway to the west we will connect the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Road to Dingalan Port through Nueva Ecija, and the Marikina- Infanta Road to the port of Real.
Upang ibsan ang pagod ng mga empleyadong namamasahe sa trapiko sa Kalakhang Maynila, mangangapital tayo sa mga expressway at tren.
We will have a continuous highway from Clark to Metro Manila to Batangas Port. Tapos na iyong expressway mula Clark hanggang Maynila. Sa ngayon wala nang isang oras ang biyahe mula Clark hanggang Monumento. Ngayon iiwasan natin ang trapiko mula Monumento, dahil idudugtong natin ang North Expressway sa C-5. Tutulong si Sonny Belmonte sa right-of-way. Ang C-5 naman ay konektado na sa South Luzon Expressway. Ang South Luzon Expressway ay pinapalapad naman hanggang Calamba. Sa Agosto, pahahabain ito hanggang Batangas. We will also build the Coastal Road to Bacoor, which has become urban under Jesse Castillo.
Pagdurugtungin natin ang MRT at LRT mula Monumento hanggang North EDSA upang mabuo ang biyahe paikot sa Kamaynilaan, at maibsan ang trapik. We will construct the Northrail to Clark and the Southrail to Lucena and on to Bicol, and upgrade the link between them. We will also extend the LRT to Bacoor. Sa pagbilis ng biyahe patungo at palabaas ng Metro Manila, makakatira ang manggagawa sa mas mura at maaliwalas na lalawigan.
Maayos na ang kapaligiran sa riles ng tren sa South Superhighway. Masaya ang mga pamilyang hinatid namin ni Vice President Noli de Castro sa kanilang bago at permanenteng relokasyon. Teddy Boy Locsin said it hadn’t been done before, and couldn’t be done at all. Well, Teddy?
Ngayon gagawin ito sa Maynila, si Lito Atienza ang bahala.
We thank China for agreeing to fund these housing needs. Huwaran ng ating programang pabahay para sa mahihirap ang mga proyekto ng Iglesia ni Kristo at Gawad Kalinga.
Ngunit kapos sa tubig ang mga taga-West Zone ng Kamaynilaan. Kaya bibigyan natin ng prayoridad hindi lamang ang edukasyon, kuryente, enerhiya, at kalusugan, kundi tubig din. We are setting up a 300 million liter per day pumping station for Muntinlupa, Las Piñas and Parañaque.
We will build a roll-on-roll-off port system to link Lucena, Quezon, to Boac, Marinduque, like the Batangas-Mindoro RORO.
Sa ganitong mga proyekto, palalakasin natin ang ekonomiya ng mga barangay at lalawigan. And we will end the long oppression of barangays by rebel terrorists who kill without qualms, even their own. Sa mga lalawigang sakop ng 7th Division, nakikibaka sa paglaban si Jovito Palparan. Hindi siya aatras hanggang makawala sa gabi ng kilabot ang mga pamayanan at maka-ahon sa bukang-liwayway ng hustisya at kalayaan.
In the harshest possible terms I condemn political killings. We together stopped judicial executions with the abolition of the death penalty. We urge witnesses to come forward. Together we will stop extrajudicial executions.
Central Philippines has the competitive edge in tourism in its natural wonders and the extraordinary hospitality of its people. The area sweeps across Palawan and Romblon, the Visayas and Bicol, plus the northern Mindanao islands of Camiguin, Siargao, and Dapitan. Topbilled by Boracay, Cebu, Bohol, and Palawan, it attracts more than half of the foreign tourists to the Philippines. It is also the center of geothermal power in the country, which we continue to develop.
The priority here is tourism investments. Coming soon for superstar Boracay are an instrument landing system for the Kalibo airport and a P3 billion private investment in a San Jose, Romblon, airport, plus good roads to spillover destinations all over Panay.
In Cebu, Gwen Garcia is constructing a world-class convention center for the ASEAN and East Asian Summits in December.
Helping our infrastructure upgrading is the fall in bribery for public sector contracts in Metro Cebu, from 62% of companies in 2004 to 47% today. Congratulations to Cardinal Vidal for shepherding his flock and to Metro Cebu Mayors Osmeña, Ouano, and Fernandez, and Metro Cebu representatives del Mar, Cuenco, Gullas, and Soon-Ruiz.
Bohol became a destination distinct from Cebu since it defeated the terrorist insurgency with community initiatives led by the power tandem of Rico Aumentado and General Johnny Gomez, now the NCR Commander. It now merits its own international airport, just as our country deserves a world-class Constitution strongly supported by Governor Aumentado and the league of local authorities.
Tourism in Palawan requires the upgrading of the airports of Puerto Princesa, Busuanga, San Vicente (hometown of Congressman Alvarez that’s why he’s clapping) and the building of a new one in Balabac; as well as a continuous road backbone from El Nido to Bataraza.
We will lengthen the Dumaguete runway for tourism as well as electronics. Valencia, Negros Oriental, could attract semiconductor firms with power rates subsidized by the geothermal field of Palimpinon. Negros will also advance energy independence with ethanol projects in San Carlos City and Tamlang Valley once the biofuel law is passed. (You have done your part, Migs.)
We will serve Guimaras by the airport being built in Santa Barbara, Iloilo, and by a new RORO port in Sibunag. We will link Sipalay via Silay airport funded by the national government and Kabankalan airport being built by its local government. Thank you.
For Bicol’s whale sharks, beaches and, of course, Mount Mayon, we have started acquiring the right of way for an international airport in Daraga, Albay. We will provide the means to the perfect surfs of the Pacific by upgrading the airports of Siargao, Guiuan, and Tacloban.
We will widen the road to Dakak in Dapitan, and RORO will connect Siquijor to Santander, Cebu; Camiguin to Jagna, Bohol; Ubay, Bohol, to Maasin, Southern Leyte, for diving in Limasawa.
We will bring Masbate and Biliran into the RORO Eastern Nautical Highway from Surigao through Leyte through Naval and Maripipi in Biliran through Esperanza, Aroroy, and Burias Island in Masbate and on to Bicol. The much-awaited 10-megawatt generator set arrived in Masbate last Saturday. It is ready to power up the province before the end of the month.
Camiguin, Romblon, and Camarines Norte got out of the list of poorest provinces in 2003. With tourism these provinces can become rich.
Also winning the war against poverty and calamity, undaunted by unimaginable catastrophe, the valiant people of Southern Leyte, under the leadership of Rosette Lerias and Oging Mercado (our Rudy Guliani) are rebuilding the lives of Saint Bernard and San Francisco from their tragic mudslides. Yesterday, I asked the Japanese government to help Southern Leyte implement an integrated management approach to deal with their critical ecosystem, like the one the World Bank has approved for the Bicol River Basin.
Mindanao is our priority for agribusiness investments in the south. Mindanao is mostly fertile and largely typhoon-free, exporting coconut products and high-value crops, and from its waters come 40% of the country’s fish catch. Our investment priorities mirror those for North Luzon and more because Mindanao has the poorest regions and poorest provinces and because we have to spend on a logistics system linking it to the north.
In 2003 we introduced the RORO from Zamboanga del Norte through Negros, Panay, and Mindoro to Batangas. This system has slashed travel time from Mindanao to Luzon from 36 hours to 24 hours, and freight cost by 30%, so crucial to food shipments. Now we will develop more routes like the one from Cagayan de Oro through Camiguin, Bohol, Cebu, and Masbate to Bicol, the Central Nautical Highway.
Also in 2003, Sulu, Lanao del Sur, and Tawi-Tawi registered double-digit declines in poverty incidence from the year 2000. Congratulations.
Kitang-kita ang pag-ibayo ng mga isla ng Sulu, Basilan, at Tawi-Tawi. Nagbukas ang Jollibee sa Basilan. The Balikatan exercises with the United States, combined with the U.S. GEM program and other donor-assisted projects, have no doubt contributed to this.
Sa Sulu, isang araw ng Mayo, umuulan, nagwakas ang isang mahabang pagtutunggali nang pumasok ang mga kawal at sibilyan sa Kampong Bitan-ag sa Panamao na hawak ng mga rebelde. Nagyakapan at nagkamayan ang dalawang panig. Dahil sa matinding pagnanais para sa kapayapaan ni Marine General Ben Dolorfino, naganap ang pagkakasundo. Gayon natapos ang isang madugong kabanata. Congratulations, General Ben Dolorfino.
Susi sa anumang pag-ibayo ang malakas na suporta at ma-abilidad na liderato ng pamahalaang local. Halimbawa, iyong “from arms to farms” ni Governor Ben Loong ng Sulu, with his caravan of tractors literally invading former rebel camps in his province. Congratulations.
Mahigit isang linggong nakaraan, dumating sa “Eleven Islands” ang daan-daang rebeldeng at kanilang pamilya, sa pamumuno ng dating MNLF Commander na si Aribari Samson. Dito sa mga pulo na kilalang “no man’s island” dati nagtatago ang mga rebelde at criminal. Ngayon sa tulong ng isang programa ng United Nations, nagtayo tayo ng 200 tahanan at panibagong buhay para sa pangkat ni Samson. Thank you for giving peace a chance. Congratulations, Commander Samson.
I take this occasion to express our gratitude to the donor community from the U.S., the Organization of the Islamic Conference [OIC], and the European Union, Australia, Japan, our ASEAN neighbors, the multilaterals, and the rest of the world. Thank you for helping us in our peace process.
If we can harness the forces of good in our nation, the positive force at work here at home and those from abroad such as the U.S., Malaysia, the OIC, and others, we shall prevail in Mindanao with a peace agreement that brings freedom and hope to all Filipinos. With this peace, we would reap dividends in resources invested in agribusiness, not aggression, to build up, not tear down, the Philippine south.
Among the possible peace dividends would be pro-poor road projects like the Siocon-Sirawai-Sibuco-Baligyan Road in Zamboanga del Norte; the Lebak to Maguindanao which Sim Datumanong started when he was Secretary of Public Works; the Dinagat Island road network in Surigao Del Norte; the Hawilian-Salug-Sinakungan barangay road in Agusan del Sur; the Pangil Bay Bridge; and the Surigao-Davao Road, which we want to be as beautiful as the Bukidnon Highway completed during the administration of Joe Zubiri and the term of Migs Zubiri.
Mindanao’s number one export, coconuts, has been growing continuously for the last three years, at the rate of 10% a year. The coconut farmers deserve a portion of the peace dividend. I invite Congress and the Bishops-Ulama-Priests-Pastors-Farmer-Lumad Conference led by Archbishop Fernando Capalla to help me ensure their rightful share.
On top of peace and investment, progress also demands good governance. I congratulate Donkoy Emano for the drop in reports of corruption for public contracts in Cagayan de Oro from 65% of firms last year to 38 this year. Also Rudy Duterte and the other leaders of Metro Davao led by Majority Leader Boy Nograles for a similar drop, 57% last year to 49 now. Things are coming together for Mindanao, a prelude to their readiness for eventual federalism.
The Cyber Corridor will boost telecommunications, technology and education. The corridor runs the length of all the super regions, from Baguio to Cebu to Davao. The cities of Davao, Tagum and Samal Island Garden all operate electronic government accounting systems. There are many wings now to the corridor because enterprising local executives like L-Ray Villafuerte and Jerry Trenas have aggressively attracted call centers to their jurisdictions. (Congratulations, Jerry.) In this corridor, the English and information and communication technology [ICT] skills of the youth give them a competitive edge in call centers and other business process outsourcing [BPO].
In 2001, in this hall, we hailed ICT as a key growth sector. So we built up telecommunications infrastructure and opened the market for Internet phone calls. Today international calls cost 6 cents a minute, down from 40 cents. From 2,000 BPO workers in 2001, we now have 200,000.
I had coffee with some call center agents last Labor Day. Lyn, a new college graduate, told me, “Now I don’t have to leave the country in order for me to help my family. Salamat po.” I was so touched, Lyn, by your comments. With these structural reforms, we not only found jobs, but kept families intact. Thank God, I thought, or someone might also try to impeach me for violating Article 15 of the Constitution on the solidarity of the family as the foundation of the nation.
As Louie Villafuerte argues, to step into the future, a country that wants to be a player in the global economy needs bold and well-funded research and development initiatives of its own. To this end, we will continuously increase the budget for science and technology and education. For in today’s global economy, knowledge is the greatest creator of wealth.
In summary, I named only a few priorities to illustrate that on many fronts, your government is working, and working well. Our economy is now growing over the longest period in the last quarter-century: 22 consecutive quarters of growth. Umakyat ng mahigit 30% ang kita ng pinakamahihirap na pamilya sa unang tatlong taon ng ating panunungkulan, at bumaba ang dami ng maralita sa 25% ng mga pamilya, mula 28%, katumbas ng 2 milyong katao na lumaya sa kahirapan. According to Thornton and Punongbayan, 70% of medium-sized business owners are optimistic, the fifth most optimistic among 30 countries, just behind India, Ireland, South Africa, and China.
Bickering in politics may delay, but not derail, the initiatives that need to be taken on our pro-poor, pro-growth, and pro-peace agenda. Regardless of the fate of the national budget, we must automate our election process. Local governments must get their rightful share of revenues. I ask Congress to pass a supplemental budget to effect this.
We are a great people. We have honest students and honest cops. We have scaled the heights of Mount Everest, dominated the Southeast Asian games, we have won international beauty titles, and of course punched our way to triumph in the boxing world. Our people compete and win every day in every imaginable job throughout the world. Individually, we’ve taken the world on and won; together, we must take on the challenge of creating a new, peaceful, humane, and competitive nation and prevail.
For those who want to pick up old fights, we’re game but what a waste of time. Why not join hands instead? Join hands in the biggest challenge of all, where we all win or we all lose: the battle for the survival and progress of our one and only country.
After 3 years, 11 months, and 6 days, I shall relinquish the Presidency, with much if not all that I have outlined completed. I do not want it said then that, in the end, I defeated my enemies. I would rather have it said that all of us, you and I, friends and foes today, achieved together a country progressive, prosperous, and united.
Thank you. Mabuhay!

Seventh State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 1st Regular Session of the 14th Congress
[Delivered  at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 23, 2007]
Thank you. Thank you very much Speaker De Venecia; Senate President Villar; other newly elected leaders of both Houses, congratulations to you; Senators and Congressmen and Congresswomen. Vice President De Castro; former President Ramos; Chief Justice Puno; our host Mayor, Mayor Sonny Belmonte; other government officials; members of the diplomatic corps; ladies and gentlemen.
We meet here today to inaugurate a new Congress after a fresh election. I congratulate every elected official, from municipal to provincial to Congress on hard fought and successful campaigns. [Applause]
Tapos na ang halalan at pamumulitika; panahon na para maglingkod nang walang damot, [applause] mamuno nang walang pangamba maliban sa kagalingan ng bayan, and to govern with wisdom, compassion, vision, and patriotism.
Hangarin kong mapabilang ang Pilipinas sa mayayamang bansa sa loob ng dalawampung taon. By then, poverty shall have been marginalized; and the marginalized raised to a robust middle class.
We will have achieved the hallmarks of a modern society, where institutions are strong.
By 2010, the Philippines should be well on its way to achieving that vision.
With the tax reforms of the last Congress, and I thank the last Congress, we have turned around our macroeconomic condition through fiscal discipline, toward a balanced budget. Binabayaran ang utang, pababa ang interes, at paakyat ang pondo para sa progreso ng sambayanang Pilipino!!! Maraming salamat ulit sa nakaraang Congress. [Applause]
We have been investing hundreds of billions in human and physical infrastructure. The next three years will see record levels of well thought out and generous funding for the following priorities:
First, investments in physical, intellectual, legal, and security infrastructure to increase business confidence. Imprastraktura para sa negosyo at trabaho. Isang milyong trabaho taun-taon.
Second, investments in a stronger and wider social safety net—murang gamot, abot-kayang pabahay, eskwelang primera klase, mga gurong magaling at mas malaki ang kita, mga librong de-kalidad, more scholarships for gifted students, and language instruction to maintain our lead in English proficiency. Dunong at kalusugan ang susi sa kasaganaan.
Third, investments in bringing peace to Mindanao; in crushing terrorism wherever it threatens regardless of ideology; and in putting a stop to human rights abuses whatever the excuse.
We pay tribute to the fearless 14 who were savagely massacred at Tipo-Tipo trying to pursue a peaceful and progressive Philippines. We will not disappoint their hopes. We will not waste their sacrifice. We will not be swayed from the course we have set in this conflict for peace with justice throughout our land. [Applause]
We have created a Philippine model for reconciliation built on interfaith dialogue, expanded public works, and more responsive social services. These investments show both sides in the Mindanao conflict that they have more at stake in common; and a greater reason to be together than hang apart, including being together isolating the terrorists.
Imprastraktura ang haliging nagtitindig hindi lamang ng kapayapaan kundi ng ating buong makabagong ekonomiya: mga kalsada, tulay, paliparan, public parks, and power plants.
Last year I unveiled the Super Regions—Mindanao, Central Philippines, North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle, Luzon Urban Beltway, and the Cyber Corridor—to spread development away from an inequitable concentration in Metro Manila. Hindi lamang Maynila ang Pilipinas. [Applause]
The Super Regions was not a gimmick for the occasion but a blueprint for building a future.
In Mindanao, our food basket, I said we would prioritize agribusiness investments. We have,  and I am happy to see that the latest survey in June that the hunger rate has sharply gone down nationwide. [Applause]
The Departments of Agriculture, Agrarian Reform, and Environment and Natural Resources will devote 30 percent of their program budgets to Mindanao. [Applause] This was the recommendation articulated by Congressman Rufus Rodriguez during our peace and security summit in Cagayan de Oro. [Applause] The Department of Agrarian Reform will move to Davao.
Dapat maging daan sa tagumpay sa agribusiness ang reporma sa lupa. Done right, reform will democratize success, as Ramon Magsaysay and Diosdado Macapagal envisioned. We must reform agrarian reform so it can transform beneficiaries into agribusinessmen and other agribusinesswomen. [Applause]
Sa gayon, dadami pa ang mga tampok na magsasaka gaya ng mga nagwagi ng Gawad Saka, sina Ananias Cuado ng Comval at Demetrio Tabelon ng Butuan; at Nelson Taladhay ng Sultan Kudarat, pangunahing agrarian reform beneficiary ng 2007. We also have outstanding farmers from the other super regions, like Joseph Fernando and Heherson Pagulayan, Nestor Bautista, Joseph Lomibao, Arturo Marcaida, Peter Uy, Arturo Pasacas, and Glenn Saludar. [Applause] Congratulations to all of you!
Sa anim na taon nagtayo tayo at nag-ayos ng patubig para sa 1 milyong ektarya sa buong bansa—pinakamalaki sa matagal na panahon.
Magtatayo tayo ng mariculture o palaisdaan sa dagat. Isa rito ay ilalagay natin sa Sibutu, sa Tawi-Tawi. Hiling ito ni Nur Jaafar. [Applause]
Para sa buong bansa naglaan tayo ng P3 billion para sa 3,000 kilometro ng farm-to-market roads; 1,000 kilometro sa Mindanao. Gawa na ang 300.
The road and RORO network has cut the cost of bringing agribusiness products from Mindanao to Luzon. A 10-wheeler used to pay P32,000 from Dapitan to Batangas. Now it pays P11,000. Fresh fish that cost P20,000 a ton to move, now travels at P14,000. [Applause]
Construction is crisscrossing Mindanao: Dapitan-Dakak to bring Cely Carreon’s paradise closer to civilization; Sibuco-Siraway-Siocon-Baliguian; Dinagat Island Network, a baptismal gift for Glenda Ecleo’s new province; [applause] the 66-kilometer Manay-Mati section of Davao-Surigao; and Maguindanao-Lebak, Sim Datumanong’s brainchild when he headed DPWH. [Applause]
We want better airports, new bridges, and ample energy for Mindanao’s rising economy.
The Dipolog and Pagadian airports will be improved by year’s end. Also the Cotabato airport. No doubt eagerly awaited by Au Cerilles, Rolando Yebes, Digs Dilangalen, Ros Labadlabad, and Victor Yu, and Mayors Evelyn Uy and Sammy Co. [Applause]
Last July 10 we inaugurated the P1.7 billion, 900-meter bridge in Butuan, built on the initiative of Mayor Boy Daku Plaza, [applause] near the P4 billion second-generation flood control project that we also built. The first was built by my father after the great flood of Butuan in the 1960s. Kailangan ipagtanggol ang kapaligiran at mamamayan sa sakuna. [Applause]
In Agusan del Norte, I hope Edel Amante will be happy with our plans to pilot micro agribusiness in Jabonga. [Applause]
On July 8, Ozamis Airport opened, bankrolled partly by Leo Ocampos, Aldo Parojinog, and Hermie Ramiro’s congressional fund. [Applause] Now, that’s the kind of pork that has good cholesterol. [Applause]
At that occasion the MOU was signed for the Pangil Bay Bridge that will connect Ozamis to Lanao del Norte and Iligan. [Applause] As urged by Bobby Dimaporo, I declared Mt. Inayawan Range a protected nature park. On Mayor Lawrence Cruz’s recommendation, I instruct DPWH to build the Iligan Circumferential Road. [Applause]
In 2001, we opened a solar plant in Cagayan de Oro. Still, Mindanao faced a 100-megawatt gap by 2009 but now a 210-megawatt clean coal plant in Phividec will fill that gap. We count on Oca Moreno and ex-congressman-now-city-mayor Tinex Jaraula to continue providing a good investment climate. [Applause]
We thank Miriam Defensor-Santiago and Migz Zubiri for sponsoring the Biofuels Law in the last Congress. [Applause] We now have 160,000 hectares of jatropha nurseries in Bukidnon and 30,000 in General Santos. Jatropha is a 100 percent substitute for diesel, with only 5 percent of its emission.
But Mindanao’s energy challenge lies not in generating power but in power lines. Terrorists target transmission towers. We must resolutely apply the Human Security Act. This act was first filed by Johnny Enrile in 1996, three years after the first World Trade Center bombing, four years before the Rizal Day bombing, and five years before 9/11. He ably crafted the final Senate version with Senate President Manny Villar and Nene Pimentel. [Applause]
Let’s now go to Central Philippines, our tourism super region:

We protect its natural wonders and provide the means to travel to those wonders.


For Boracay, the leading overall destination, the Kalibo Airport is now international with an instrument landing system as we said last year. Next is an P80 million terminal on request of Joben Miraflores. [Applause]


The Aklan-Libertad-Pandan Road, waiting for Japan to approve the contractors, will connect Boracay to the nature park we declared in Northwest Panay Peninsula. We are improving other Panay roads and building the road from the Iloilo Airport which we inaugurated in Santa Barbara to Iloilo and the Metro Radial Road that Mayor Jerry Trenas asked for. [Applause] When we inaugurated the airport, I said  that Art Defensor conceived the airport when he was governor, and Governor Neil Tupaz midwifed it into delivery. [Applause]


Iloilo connects to Guimaras via Jordan Wharf. For the P900 million oil spill calamity fund to save the environment of Guimaras, I thank once again the previous Congress. Thank you very much on behalf of the people of Guimaras, who are now back on their feet. [Applause] The other side of the island will connect to Bacolod soon because we started building the Sibunag RORO Airport last May on recommendation of governor-now-congressman, Rahman Nava.


Bacolod-Silay Airport, near the nature park we declared in Northern Negros, is completed and just awaiting the access road requested by Monico Puentavella. [Applause]


We awarded the contract for upgrading the Dumaguete airport as I reported to George Arnaiz last week.


Boracay investors are expanding in Palawan, whose Tubbataha Reefs we declared a nature park. After the Puerto Princesa-Roxas Road last year, we opened Taytay-El Nido last March. The P1 billion Taytay-Roxas section is ongoing. San Vicente airstrip and Busuanga Airport are under construction, and Mayor Hagedorn is reminding us to work on the Puerto Princesa terminal.


Under construction also are airport aprons of the surfing edens: Governor Ben Evardone’s pet project in Guiuan and Lalo Matugas’ home town in Siargao.


A 100-megawatt energy gap looms in the Visayas in 2009. The Korea Electric plant in Cebu will plug in 200 megawatts only in 2010 so there’s a one year gap. In the meantime three power barges will supply 100 megawatts, and the Panay diesel power plant will increase its run from 70 megawatts to 100 megawatts.


In Central Cebu, we proclaimed a nature park. From Cebu, the top destination for foreign tourists, the tourists can easily radiate to other destinations. Optimism is infectious, and opportunity irresistible. Progress follows progress. Someone, even government, just has to get it started.


Going south, Cebu connects to Tubigon and on to Ubay, Jagna, and Panglao through the Bohol Circumferential Road that we inaugurated last May 9. The local government has acquired 85 percent of the land for the international airport on Panglao Island, now a tourism destination of its own.


Ubay links to Maasin RORO Port which was completed last October. Now I hope there will be more divers visiting the province of Mian Mercado.


Jagna RORO port opened last May 9. It will connect to Loloy Romualdo’s Mambajao in and Lansones, and on to Guinsiliban, the gateway to Mindanao.


Going north from Cebu City, we take the North Coastal Road to Daanbantayan, which was recommended to us by Gwen Garcia. Heavy traffic will cease when the P1.2 billion Mandaue-Consolacion Bridge opens. This will be good not only for Malapascua tourism but also for Nitoy Durano’s industrial city of Danao.


Daanbantayan, Benhur Salimbangon’s home port, connects to Naval, Maripipi, or Esperanza, which started construction last May. We aim to finish all three RORO ports next year. [Applause]


Esperanza will link by road to Aroroy in 2009. I’ll be there with Lina Seachon and Tony Kho for the inauguration. Please invite me. [Applause]


Last May, I switched on the lights of Masbate in a Palace ceremony. But the long-term solution will come next year when a new power plant will serve half a million customers in the beautiful but isolated island of Masbate.


From Aroroy we can go to Claveria, whose RORO ramp is under construction. On to Pasacao where RORO operations started in 2002.  [Applause] That’s Bong Bravo from Claveria. [Applause] This brings us to Bicol, including Mt. Isarog Park.


Mt. Isarog feeds the Bicol River. For the next three years we are funding the Bicol River Basin and Watershed with the World Bank at $15 million for irrigation, flood control, and water conservation. [Applause] For Bicol, we have given P7 billion out of the P10 billion Bicol Calamity and Rehabilitation Effort; that is the biggest one-time calamity fund release in our history. [Applause] At last, Bicol is getting its rightful share.

And, so is the North Luzon Agribusiness Quadrangle:

We are building 1,000 kilometers of farm-to-market roads; 200 are done. Ngayong tapos na ang election ban, pinapaspasan ang trabaho para sa nalalabing target.


Halsema Highway from Mount Data to Bontoc and the Tabuk-Tinglayan Road are being built. If you look at the chart, there is something incomplete in between.


So that the Cordillera LGUs can also contribute to building more of their much-needed roads, I ask Congress to require companies to pay directly to the LGUs their share of the natural wealth. [Applause] I hope Governor Dalog hears that.


Nagtatayo tayo ng mga paliparan para sa mga produkto ng agribusiness.


Noong 2005 nagka-airport sa Baler. Sunod ang reconstruction, ang airport sa Casiguran. At kalsada sa pagitan.


There were no takers in the bidding to upgrade the Batanes runway so ATO will get it done before the end of the year with the support of DPWH and Governor Telesforo Castillejos.


Joe de Venecia and Mayor Nani Braganza are asking for an airport in Alaminos. Will do. [Applause]


The Cagayan Economic Zone Authority and the private sector expanded the San Vicente naval airstrip, so we don’t have need to build a Lallo airport.


Pero sa Lallo naman mayroon tayong inaprobahan na agribusiness ecozone. Ang mga agribusiness ecozone ay payo ni Pangulong Ramos. [Applause] Chief Justice Puno, I am happy to see you here. It is the first time that a Chief Justice attended. [Applause]


The Tarlac-La Union Toll Road will be advertised for private sector BOT bidding this August.


Poro Point’s international terminal started construction early this year. The Bagabag airport is being lengthened. We are spreading the cheer across the political spectrum from Vic Ortega to Caloy Padilla. Inuuna ang bansa, itinatabi ang politika. [Applause]


Some towns in Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, and Isabela are included in the geohazard mapping we have done for 700 cities and towns all over the country to protect the environment.


The Bangui Bay Wind Power Project which was put up when Bongbong Marcos was still governor, is now expanding. Sa paggamit ng hangin, nababawasan ang kailangang langis sa enerhiya. [Applause]

And now the Luzon Urban Beltway, our top magnet for industry and investment:

This quarter we start the P5 billion Mt. Pinatubo Hazard Urgent Mitigation Project that will protect San Fernando City, Sasmuan, Guagua, and my hometown Lubao from flooding. [Applause]


The Subic-Clark-Tarlac Express Road is in its final stages. This first-world road will cut travel time between Clark and Subic from 2 hours to 30 minutes. [Applause] Gagawa tayo ng interchange sa Porac, bayan ni Lito Lapid. [Applause]


Last Thursday with Dick Gordon we inaugurated the container port that will make Subic together with Clark one of the best international service and logistics centers in the region. [Applause]


Clark airport got its approach control radar in April. It now has 50 international flights and 50 cargo flights a week, the second busiest after NAIA. We want more airline service centers there. Now, speaking of NAIA, I’m sure everyone wants to know about Terminal 3. The ceiling that fell wasn’t the only thing in danger of falling. There are more serious dangers from construction and structural defects. We cannot risk the grim consequences of a major earthquake. But NAIA is accelerating the remediation, completion, and opening of the terminal. Public safety comes first. [Applause]


Because public safety comes first, and we have many more modern airports now, I ask Congress to create the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. [Applause]


Last year, I said we would connect North and South Expressways through C-5. Ginagawa na ang C-5 bandang Katipunan. Kausap na ang UP para sa bagong daan patungong Commonwealth, na kasulukuyang pinapalapad, at North Avenue. Sa kabilang dulo ng Mindanao Avenue, binibili na ang lupa para sa bagong daan mula Barangay Talipapa hanggang Malinta at tuloy na ito sa NLEX. Sana bumawas ang trapik pa-North Metro Manila. [Applause]


We just broke ground to continue the Skyway up to Alabang. [Applause] And in a year aside from that, the fast train from Caloocan to Alabang will be serving thousands daily. [Applause] From Alabang to Santo Tomas, the South Luzon Expressway is currently being widened. And by March, Vicky Reyes, SLEX will reach all the way up to Batangas Port. [Applause]


The Coastal Road to Bong Revilla’s province is finally under construction after so many groundbreaking ceremonies.


Our investment in vital infrastructure is already bearing fruit, such as the $1-billion Hanjin shipbuilding facility, said to be the largest in the world, and the $1-billion Texas Instruments microchip plant in Clark. Maging ex-OFW o ex-tambay kapwang nakahanap ng trabaho sa mga malalaking puhunan na ito. [Applause]


As we build industry, we must ensure people have clean air to breathe. We have closed 88 firms for polluting the environment. [Applause] Gaya ng sabi ko, una ang kaligatasan ng publiko.


We proclaimed a critical habitat within the coastal lagoon of Las Piñas and Parañaque.


Maynilad’s new owners have invested P7 billion to bring clean and, at last, running water to Paranaque, Parola, and elsewhere. Manila Water did a similar P2 billion project for Antipolo. [Applause]


Gumagawa tayo ng septage tank sa Antipolo sa halagang P600 million na maglilinis ng sewage bago ito dumaloy sa mga estero, gaya ng tinayo ng Manila Water sa Taguig at sa San Mateo.


Matapos ang maraming taong usapan, ang ating administrasyon ang nakapagsimula ng Flood Control Project sa Kalookan, Malabon, Navotas, at Valenzuela (CAMANAVA). [Applause]


On energy, Luzon needs 150 megawatts more by 2010. This is covered by the 350-megawatt, $350 million expansion of the Pagbilao plant by Marubeni and Tokyo Electric, part of their $4 billion that constitutes the biggest Japanese investment in Philippine history. [Applause] We count on Governor Raffy Nantes and the people of Quezon to take care of the investment climate. [Applause]


Last year, I said we must reduce the cost of electricity. Some houses have reported paying less in their bills but it’s still high. I ask Congress to amend the Electric Power Industry Reform Act for open access and more competition. [Applause]

The Cyber Corridor encompasses centers of technology and learning running the length of all the super regions, from Baguio to Clark to Metro Manila to Cebu to Davao and neighboring areas. [Applause]
The Philippines ranks among top off-shoring hubs in the world because of cost competitiveness and more importantly our highly trainable, English proficient, IT-enabled management and manpower.
IT ability won for Warren Ambat of Baguio City High the most innovative teacher and leadership award in Cambodia last February, topping contestants from 70 countries. Congratulations Baguio and Warren! [Applause]
Information technology will help the BIR bring in more taxes in the coming months. Its Revenue Watch Dashboard will monitor revenue collections in real time from the national level down to the examiners. Its LGU Revenue Assurance will share information between the BIR and the LGUs to uncover fraud and nonpayment, before heads would roll per Danny Suarez’s Attrition Law. [Applause]
While our strength in contact centers is well established, we are now focused on growing the higher value-added services, including accounting, legal, human resources, and administrative services.
And, so that no Taiwan tremor can cut off our cyber services from their global clients, thanks to PLDT and Globe for investing P47 billion in new international broadband links through other regional hubs for redundancy in our cyberspace. [Applause]
The business services sector has become the fastest growing in the economy providing 400,000 jobs compared to 8,000 in 2000. By 2010 the forecast is 1 million jobs earning $12 billion, the same amount remitted by our overseas Filipinos today. [Applause]
On Safety Net and Education
Last year I said that in today’s global economy, knowledge is the greatest creator of wealth. Mahusay na edukasyon ang pinakamabuting pamana natin sa ating mga anak. Yun din ang tanging pamana na ayon sa batas kailangang ibigay sa bawat mamamayan.
This year, we are investing more for education: P150 billion, P29 billion more than last year.
And, last year government and private sector built 15,000 classrooms instead of the usual 6,000.
Noon, isang libro bawat limang mag-aaral. Ngayon, tig-isang aklat na bawat grade schooler. [Applause]
One third of our public high schools now have Internet access, with private sector support.
We have a scarcity of public high schools but a surplus of private high schools. So instead of building more high schools, we give more high school scholarships—600,000 scholars this year. [Applause]
For college, we launched a P4 billion fund for college loans, to increase beneficiaries from 40,000 to 200,000.
And for teachers, we have created more than 50,000 teaching positions. But we have to improve their training.
Benefits, too. Salamat, dating Senador Tessie Oreta at dating Congressman Dodong Gullas, na di na kailangan ng mga guro maghabol sa Maynila ng sweldo at pension. [Applause] Pinoproseso na sa rehiyon sa regionalization ng payroll.
Teachers and all other national government employees for that matter get a raise effective end of this month. [Applause]
Sa TESDA, bukod sa mga sariling kurso, nagbibigay ito ng mga scholarship sa vocational schools: P600 million noong isang taon, P1 billion ngayon. May P1 billion pa ang DOLE.
We are investing P3 billion in science and engineering research and development technology, including scholarships for masters and doctoral degrees in engineering in seven universities. Upgrade know-how and learning, and Filipino talent is unbeatable.
Proof is biochemist Baldomero Olivera of the University of Utah who was named Scientist of the Year by the Harvard Foundation. [Applause]
In the International Math and Science Olympiad 2006 in Jakarta, Robert Buendia of Cavite Central School and Wilson Alba of San Beda Alabang won the gold. Congratulations, guys! [Applause] Six Filipinos bagged the awards at the Intel Young Scientists Competition in New Mexico last May: Ivy Ventura, Mara Villaverde, Hester Mana Umayam, and Janine Santiago of Philippine Science High; [applause] Melvin Barroa of Capiz National High, congratulations, Melvin; [applause] and Luigi John Suarez of Benedicto National High. Congratulations naman. [Applause] Last week Filipino students topbilled by Amiel Sy of the Philippine Science High dominated the Mathematics World Contest in Hong Kong. Congratulations, Amiel. Congratulations Philippine Science High. [Applause] Earlier this month Diona Aquino of the Presidential Management Staff won with her team from UP the Youth Innovation Competition on Global Governance in Shanghai. [Applause]
Ito ay malaking kunsuwelo sa atin. We have spent more on human capital formation than ever in the past. Why? Because if government of the people and by the people is not for them as well, it is a mockery of democracy. [Applause]
May malaking pag-angat ang kalagayan ng maralita, gaya ng trabaho, pag-aaral, at paggamot. Look at the chart about how fare the poor.
Sa unang pagkakataon, gumastos ang Philhealth ng higit P3 bilyon sa paospital ng maralita.
Noong 2001 sinabi kong hahatiin natin ang presyo ng gamot na madalas bilhin ng madla. Ngayon 10,000 Botika ng Barangay ang nagtitinda ng murang gamot. Ang paracetamol na tatlong piso sa labas ay piso lamang sa Botika ng Barangay. Ang antibiotic na binibenta ng mga pangunahing parmasya sa P20 ay P2 lamang.
Kaya sa isang survey, halos kalahati ang nagsabing abot-kaya ang gamot, kumpara sa 11 percent noong 1999.
So we can spread this even more, I ask Congress to pass the Cheaper Medicines Bill [applause] that was almost enacted in June. Almost is not good enough. Let’s help Mar Roxas and Ferge Biron and Teddy Boy Locsin give our people meaningful, affordable choices, from abroad and here in the Philippines. [Applause]
I also ask Congress to pass legislation that brings improved long-term care for our senior citizens. Asahan natin si Ed Angara. [Applause]
Si Noli de Castro na isa pang kampeon ng senior citizens ay namumuno ng ating programa sa pabahay. Congratulations, Noli. The low interest rates for housing are unprecedented. [Applause] Naglaan ang Pag-IBIG ng P25 billion na pautang, six times the amount when we started it in 2001. At P50 billion pa ang ilalaan hanggang 2010. [Applause]
On Terrorism and Human Rights
We fight terrorism. It threatens our sovereign, democratic, compassionate, and decent way of life.
Therefore, in the fight against lawless violence, we must uphold these values. It is never right and always wrong to fight terror with terror.
And so I ask Congress … I urge you to enact laws to transform state response to political violence: First, laws to protect witnesses from lawbreakers and law enforcers. [Applause] Second, laws to guarantee swift justice from more empowered special courts. [Applause] Third, laws to impose harsher penalties for political killings. [Applause] Fourth, laws reserving the harshest penalties for the rogue elements in the uniformed services who betray public trust and bring shame to the greater number of their colleagues who are patriotic. [Applause]
We must wipe this stain from our democratic record.
Ngunit pangunahing pakikibaka pa rin para sa karapatan ang pagpapalaya ng masa sa gutom at kahirapan.
Together with economic prosperity is the need to strengthen our institutions of government. Let’s start with election reform. We have long provided funds for computerization. We look forward to the modernization of voting, counting, and canvassing. [Applause]
We can disagree on political goals but never on the conduct of democratic elections. I ask Congress to fund poll watchdogs, and to enact a stronger law against election-related violence. [Applause]
We must weed out corruption and build a strong system of justice that the people can trust. We have provided unprecedented billions for antigraft efforts. Thus the Ombudsman’s conviction rate hit 77 percent this year, from 6 percent in 2002. [Applause] We implemented lifestyle checks, dormant for half a century. Taun-taon dose-dosenang opisyal ang nasususpinde, napapatalsik, o kinakasuhan dahil labis-labis sa suweldo ang gastos at ari-arian nila.
Firms who were asked for bribes in taxes, permits, and licenses dropped to one-third from one-half. Contract bribes are also down. Graft won’t be eliminated overnight but we are making progress. [Applause]
In Conclusion
What I have outlined today is just a sampler of our P1.7 trillion Medium Term Public Investment Program. How will we fund all these? P1 trillion from state revenues, with tax reforms and firm orders to BIR and Customs to hit their targets. P300 billion from state corporations. The balance from government financial institutions, private sector investments, local government equity, and our bilateral and multilateral partners.
Our new confidence and momentum for progress have imbued our foreign relations, with the ASEAN Summit last year and the coming ASEAN Regional Forum, with increased assistance from our allies and with continued support for our peace and security efforts in Mindanao.
We were able to strengthen our economy because of the fiscal reforms that we adopted at such great cost to me in public disapproval. But I would rather be right than popular. [Applause]
Our fundamentals are paying off in huge leaps in investment. Anim na milyong trabaho ang nalikha sa anim na taon, most in sustainable enterprises. Sa lakas ng piso, bumagal ang pagtaas ng bilihin. [Applause]
It is my ardent wish that most of the vision I have outlined will be fully achieved when I step down. It is my unshakable resolve that the fundamentals of this vision will by then be permanently rooted, its progress well advanced, and its direction firmly fixed with our reforms already bearing fruit. All that will remain for my successor is to gather the harvest. He or she will have an easier time of it than I did. [Applause]
They say the campaign for the next election started on May 15, the day after the last. Fine.
I stand in the way of no one’s ambition. I only ask that no one stand in the way of the people’s well-being and the nation’s progress. [Applause]
The time for facing off is over. The time is here for facing forward to a better future our people so desperately want and richly deserve. [Applause]
Uulitin ko: Hindi ako sagabal sa ambisyon ninuman.
But make no mistake. I will not stand idly when anyone gets in the way of the national interest and tries to block the national vision. [Applause] From where I sit, I can tell you, a President is always as strong as she wants to be. [Applause] [Standing ovation]
Pagpalain tayo ng Diyos at ang dakilang gawaing hinaharap natin. The state of the nation is strong. [Applause]
Inyong lingkod, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, pangulo ng Republika ng Pilipinas. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

Eighth State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 2nd Regular Session of the 14th Congress
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City, on July 28, 2008]
Thank you, Speaker Nograles. Senate President Villar. Senators and Representatives. Vice President de Castro, President Ramos, Chief Justice Puno, members of the diplomatic corps, ladies and gentlemen:
I address you today at a crucial moment in world history.
Just a few months ago, we ended 2007 with the strongest economic growth in a generation. Inflation was low, the peso strong, and a million new jobs were created. We were all looking to a better, brighter future. [Applause]
Because tough choices were made, kumikilos na ang bayan sa wakas. Malapit na sana tayo sa pagbalanse ng budget. We were retiring debts in great amounts, reducing the drag on our country’s development, habang namumuhunan sa taong bayan. [Applause]
Biglang-bigla, nabaligtad ang ekonomiya ng mundo. Ang pagtalon ng presyo ng langis at pagkain ay nagbunsod ng pandaigdigan krisis, the worst since the Great Depression and the end of World War II. Some blame speculators moving billions of dollars from subprime mortgages to commodities like fuel and food. Others point of the very real surge in demand as millions of Chinese and Indians move up to the middle class.
Whatever the reasons, we are on a roller coaster ride of oil price hikes, high food prices, and looming economic recession in the US and other markets. Uncertainty has moved like a terrible tsunami around the globe, wiping away gains, erasing progress.
This is a complex time that defies simple and easy solutions. For starters, it is hard to identify villains, unlike in the 1997 financial crisis. Everyone seems to be a victim, rich countries and poor, though certainly some can take more punishment than others.
To address these global challenges, we must go on building and buttressing bridges to allies around the world: to bring in the rice to feed our people; investments to create jobs; and to keep the peace and maintain stability in our country and the rest of the world. Yet even as we reach out to those who need, and who may need us, we strive for greater self-reliance. [Applause]
Because tough choices were made, the global crisis did not catch us helpless and unprepared. Through foresight, grit, and political will, we built a shield around our country that has slowed down and somewhat softened the worst effects of the global crisis. [Applause] We have the money to care for our people and pay for food when there are shortages; for fuel despite price spikes. [Applause]
Neither we nor anyone else in the world expected this day to come so soon but we prepared for it. For the guts not to flinch in the face of tough choices, I thank God. For the wisdom to recognize how needed you are, I thank you Congress. [Applause] For footing the bill, I thank the taxpayers. [Applause]
The result has been, on the one hand, ito ang nakasalba sa bayan; on the other, more unpopularity for myself in the opinion polls. Yet even unfriendly polls show self-rated poverty down to its 20-year low in 2007. [Applause]
My responsibility as President is to take care, to solve the problems we are facing now, and to provide a vision and direction for how our nation should advance in the future.
Many in this great hall live privileged lives and exert great influence in public affairs. I am accessible to you, but I spend time every day with the underprivileged and under represented who cannot get a grip on their lives in the daily, all-consuming struggle to make ends meet.
Nag-aalala ako para sa nakakaawang maybahay na pasan ang pananagutan para sa buong pamilya. Nag-aalala ako para sa magsasakang nasa unang hanay ng pambansang produksyon ng pagkain ngunit nagsisikap pakanin ang pamilya. I care for hardworking students soon to graduate and wanting to see hope of good job and a career prospect here at home.
Nag-aalala ako para sa 41-year old na padre de pamilya na di araw-araw ang trabaho, at nag-aabala sa asawa at tatlong anak, at dapat bigyan ng higit pang pagkakakitaan at dangal. I care for our teachers who gave the greatest gift we ever received—a good education—still trying to pass on the same gift to succeeding generations. I care for our OFWs, famed for their skill, integrity, and untiring labor, who send home their pay as the only way to touch loved ones so far away. [Applause] Nagpupugay ako ngayon sa kanilang mga karaniwang Pilipino. [Applause]
My critics say this is fiction, along with other facts and figures I cite today. I call it heroism though they don’t need our praise. Each is already a hero to those who matter most—their families.
I said this is a global crisis where everyone is a victim. But only few can afford to avoid, or pay to delay, the worst effects.
Many more have nothing to protect them from the immediate blunt force trauma of the global crisis. Tulad ninyo, nag-aalala ako para sa kanila. Ito ang mga taong bayan na dapat samahan natin. Not only because of their sacrifices for our country but because they are our countrymen. [Applause]
How do we solve these many complex challenges?
Sa kanilang kalagayan, the answer must be special care and attention in this great hour of need.
First, we must have a targeted strategy with a set of precise prescriptions to ease the price challenges we are facing.
Second, food self-sufficiency; less energy dependence; greater self-reliance in our attitude as a people and in our posture as a nation. [Applause]
Third, short-term relief cannot be at the expense of long-term reforms. [Applause] These reforms will benefit not just the next generation of Filipinos, but the next President as well. [Applause]
Napakahalaga ang value-added tax [VAT] sa pagharap sa mga hamong ito.
Itong programa ang sagot sa mga problemang namana natin. [Applause]
Una, mabawasan ang ating mga utang and shore up our fiscal independence. [Applause]
Pangalawa, higit na pamumuhunan para mamamayan at imprastraktura. [Applause]
Pangatlo, sapat na pondo para sa mga programang pangmasa. [Applause]
Thus, the infrastructure links programmed for the our poorest provinces like Northern Samar: Lao-ang-Lapinig-Arteche, right now ay maputik; San Isidro-Lope de Vega; the rehabilitation of Maharlika in Samar. [Applause]
Take VAT away and you and I abdicate our responsibility as leaders and pull the rug from under our present and future progress, which may be compromised by the global crisis.
Lalong lumakas ang tiwala ng mga investor dahil sa VAT. Mula P56.50 kada dolyar, lumakas ang piso hanggang P40.20 bago bumalik sa P44 dahil sa mga pabigat ng pangdaigdigang ekonomiya. Kung alisin ang VAT, hihina ang kumpiyansa ng negosyo, lalong tataas ang interes, lalong bababa ang piso, lalong mamahal ang bilihin.
Kapag ibinasura ang VAT sa langis at kuryente, ang mas makikinabang ay ang mga maykaya na kumukonsumo ng 84% ng langis at 90% ng kuryente habang mas masasaktan ang mahihirap na mawawalan ng P80 billion para sa mga programang pinopondohan ngayon ng VAT. [Applause] Take away VAT and we strip our people of the means to ride out the world food and energy crisis. [Applause]
We have come too far and made too many sacrifices to turn back now on fiscal reforms. Leadership is not about doing the first easy thing that comes to mind; it is about doing what is necessary, however hard. [Applause]
The government has persevered, without flip-flops, in its much-criticized but irreplaceable policies, including oil and power VAT and oil deregulation.
Patuloy na gagamitin ng pamahalaan ang lumalago nating yaman upang tulungan ang mga pamilyang naghihirap sa taas ng bilihin at hampas ng bagyo, habang nagpupundar upang sanggahan ang bayan sa mga krisis sa hinaharap.
Para sa mga namamasada at namamasahe sa dyip, sinusugpo natin ang kotong at colorum upang mapataas ang kita ng mga tsuper. [Applause] Si Federico Alvarez kumikita ng P200 a day sa kaniyang rutang Cubao-Rosario. Tinaas ito ng anti-kotong, anti-colorum ngayon P500 na ang kita niya. [Applause] Iyan ang paraan kung paano napananatili ang dagdag-pasahe sa P1 lamang. Halaga lang ng isang text. [Applause]
Texting is a way of life. I asked the telecoms to cut the cost of messages between networks. They responded. It is now down to 50 centavos. [Applause]
Noong Hunyo, nagpalabas tayo ng 4 bilyong piso mula sa VAT sa langis—2 bilyong pambayad ng koryente ng 4 milyong mahihirap, 1 bilyon para college scholarship o pautang sa 70,000 na estudyanteng maralita; [applause] kalahating bilyong pautang upang palitan ng mas matipid na LPG, CNG, o biofuel ang motor ng libu-libong jeepney; [applause] at kalahating bilyong pampalit sa fluorescent sa mga pampublikong lugar. [Applause]
Kung mapapalitan ng fluorescent ang lahat ng bumbilya, makatitipid tayo ng lampas P2 billion. [Applause]
Sa sunod na katas ng VAT, may P1 billion na pambayad ng kuryente ng mahihirap; kalahating bilyon para sa matatandang di sakop ng SSS o GSIS; kalahating bilyong kapital para sa pamilya ng mga namamasada; kalahating bilyon upang mapataas ang kakayahan at equipment ng mga munting ospital sa mga lalawigan. [Applause] At para sa mga kalamidad, angkop na halaga.
We released P1 billion for the victims of typhoon Frank. We support a supplemental Western Visayas calamity budget from VAT proceeds,[applause] as a tribute to the likes of Rodney Berdin, age 13, of Barangay Rombang, Belison, Antique, who saved his mother, brother, and sister from the raging waters of Sibalom River. [Applause]
Mula sa buwang ito, wala nang income tax ang sumusweldo ng P200,000 o mas mababa sa isang taon—P12 billion na bawas-buwis para sa maralita at middle class. Maraming salamat, Congress. [Applause]
Ngayong may P32 na commercial rice, natugunan na natin ang problema sa pagkain sa kasalukuyan. Nagtagumpay tayo dahil sa pagtutulungan ng buong bayan sa pagsasaka, bantay-presyo, at paghihigpit sa price manipulation, sa masipag na pamumuno ni Artie Yap. [Applause]
Sa mga LGU at religious groups na tumutulong dalhin ang NFA rice sa mahihirap, maraming salamat sa inyo. [Applause]
Dahil sa subsidy, NFA rice is among the region’s cheapest. While we can take some comfort that our situation is better than many other nations, there is no substitute for solving the problem of rice and fuel here at home. In doing so, let us be honest and clear eyed—there has been a fundamental shift in global economics. The price of food and fuel will likely remain high. Nothing will be easy; the government cannot solve these problems over night. But we can work to ease the near-term pain while investing in long-term solutions. [Applause]
Since 2001, new irrigation systems for 146,000 hectares, including Malmar in Maguindanao and North Cotabato, Lower Agusan, Casecnan and Aulo in Nueva Ecija, Abulog-Apayao in Cagayan and Apayao, Addalam in Quirino and Isabela among others, and the restoration of old systems on another 980,000 hectares have increased our nation’s irrigated land to a historic 1.5 million hectares. [Applause]
Edwin Bandila, 48 years old, of Ugalingan, Carmen, North Cotabato, cultivated 1 hectare and harvested 35 cavans. Thirteen years na ginawa iyong Malmar. In my first State of the Nation Address, sabi ko kung hindi matapos iyon sa Setyembre ay kakanselahin ko ang kontrata, papapasukin ko ang engineering brigade, natapos nila. With Malmar, now he cultivates 5 hectares [applause] and produces 97 cavans per hectare. Mabuhay, Edwin! VAT will complete the San Roque-Agno River project. [Applause]
The Land Bank has quadrupled loans for farmers and fisherfolk. That is fact not fiction. Check it. For more effective credit utilization, I instructed DA to revitalize farmers cooperatives. [Applause]
We are providing seeds at subsidized prices to help our farmers.
Incremental Malampaya national revenues of P4 billion will go to our rice self-sufficiency program. [Applause]
Rice production since 2000 increased an average of 4.07% a year, twice the population growth rate. By promoting natural planning and female education, we have curbed population growth to 2.04% during our administration, down from the 2.36% in the 1990s, when artificial birth control was pushed. [Applause] Our campaign spreads awareness of responsible parenthood regarding birth spacing. Long years of pushing contraceptives made it synonymous to family planning. Therefore, informed choice should mean letting more couples, who are mostly Catholics, know about natural family planning. [Applause]
From 1978 to 1981, nag-export tayo ng bigas. Hindi tumagal. But let’s not be too hard on ourselves. Panahon pa ng Kastila bumibili na tayo ng bigas sa labas. While we may know how to grow rice well, topography doesn’t always cooperate.
Nature did not gift us with a mighty Mekong like Thailand and Vietnam, with their vast and naturally fertile plains. Nature instead put our islands ahead of our neighbors in the path of typhoons from the Pacific. So, we import 10% of the rice we consume.
To meet the challenge of today, we will feed our people now, not later, and help them get through these hard times. To meet the challenges of tomorrow, we must become more self-reliant, self-sufficient, and independent, relying on ourselves more than on the world. [Applause]
Now we come to the future of agrarian reform.
There are those who say it is a failure, that our rice importations prove it. There are those who say it is a success—if only because anything is better than nothing. Indeed, people are happier owning the land they work, no matter what the difficulties.
Sa SONA noong 2001, sinabi ko, bawat taon, mamamahagi tayo ng 200,000 ektarya sa reporma sa lupa: 100,000 hectares of private farmland; and 100,000 of public farmland, including ancestral domains. Di hamak mahigit sa target ang naipamahagi natin sa nakaraang pitong taon: 854,000 hectares of private farmland, 797,000 of public farmland, and Certificates of Ancestral Domain for 525,000 hectares. [Applause] Including, over a 100,000 hectares for the Bugkalots in Quirino, Aurora, and Nueva Vizcaya. After the release of their CADT, Rosario Camma, Bugkalot chieftain, and now mayor of Nagtipunan, helped his 15,000-member tribe develop irrigation, plant vegetables and corn, and achieve food sufficiency. Mabuhay, Chief! [Applause]
Agrarian reform should not merely subdivide misery, it must raise living standards. Ownership raises the farmer from his knees but productivity will keep him on his feet.
Sinimula ng aking ama ang land reform noong 1963. Upang mabuo ito, the extension of CARP with reforms is top priority. [Applause] I will continue to do all I can for the rural as well as urban poor. Ayaw natin na paglaya ng tenant sa landlord, mapapasa-ilalim naman sa usurero. Former tenants must be empowered to become agribusinessmen by allowing their land to be used as collateral. [Applause]
Dapat mapalaya ng reporma sa lupa ang magsasaka sa pagiging alipin sa iba. Dapat bigyan ang magsasaka ng dangal bilang taong malaya at di hawak ninuman. We must curb the recklessness that gives land without the means to make it productive and bites off more than beneficiaries can chew. [Applause]
At the same time, I want the rackets out of agrarian reform: [applause] the threats to take and therefore undervalue land, the conspiracies to overvalue it.
Be with me on this. There must be a path where justice and progress converge. Let us find it before Christmas. [Applause] Dapat nating linisin ang landas para sa mga ibig magpursige sa pagsasaka, taglay ang pananalig na ang lupa ay sasagip sa atin sa huli kung gamitin natin ito nang maayos.
Along with massive rice production, we are cutting costs through more efficient transport. For our farm-to-market roads, we released P6 billion in 2007.
On our nautical highways. RORO boats carried 33 million metric tons of cargo and 31 million passengers in 2007. We have built 39 RORO ports during our administration, 12 more are slated to start within the next two years. In 2003, we inaugurated the Western Nautical Highway from Batangas through Mindoro, Panay and Negros to Mindanao. This year we launched the Central Nautical Highway from Bicol mainland through Masbate, Cebu, Bohol and Camiguin to Mindanao mainland. [Applause] These developments strengthen our competitiveness.
Leading multinational company Nestle cut transport costs and offset higher milk prices abroad. Salamat, RORO. [Applause] Transport costs have become so reasonable for bakeries like Gardenia, a loaf of its bread in Iloilo is priced the same as in Laguna and Manila. Salamat muli sa RORO. [Applause]
To the many LGUs who have stopped collecting fees from cargo vehicles, maraming, maraming salamat. [Applause]
We are repaving airports that are useful for agriculture, like Zamboanga City Airport. [Applause]
Producing rice and moving it cheaper addresses the supply side of our rice needs. On the demand side, we are boosting the people’s buying power.
Ginagawa nating labor-intensive ang paggawa at pag-ayos ng kalsada at patubig. Noong SONA ng 2001, naglunsad tayo sa NCR ng patrabaho para sa 20,000 na out of school youth, na tinawag na OYSTER. Ngayon, mahigit 20,000 ang ineempleyo ng OYSTER sa buong bansa. [Applause] In disaster-stricken areas, we have a cash-for-work program.
In training, 7.74 million took technical and vocational courses over the last seven years, double the number in the previous 14 years. In 2007 alone, 1.7 million graduated. Among them are Jessica Barlomento now in Hanjin as supply officer, Shenve Catana, Marie Grace Comendador, and Marlyn Tusi, lady welders, congratulations. [Applause]
In microfinance, loans have reached P102 billion or 30 times more than the P3 billion we started with in 2001, with a 98% repayment record, congratulations! [Applause] Major lenders include the Land Bank with P69 billion, the Peoples’ Credit and Finance Corporation P8 billion, the National Livelihood Support Fund P3 billion, DBP P1 billion, and the DSWD’s SEA-K P800 million. For partnering with us to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit, thank you, Go Negosyo and Joey Concepcion. [Applause]
Upland development benefits farmers through agro-forestry initiatives. Rubber is especially strong in Zamboanga Sibugay and North Cotabato. [Applause] Victoria Mindoro, 56 years old, used to earn P5,000 a month as farmer and factory worker. Now she owns 10 hectares in the Goodyear Agrarian Reform Community in Kabasalan, Zamboanga Sibugay, earning P10,000 a week. [Applause] With 1 hectare, Pedro and Concordia Faviolas of Makilala, North Cotabato, sent their six children to college, bought two more hectares, and earn P15,000 a month. Congratulations! [Applause]
Jatropha estates are starting in 900 hectares in and around Tamlang Valley in Negros Oriental; 200 in CamSur; 300 in GenSan, 500 in Fort Magsaysay near the Cordero Dam, and 700 in Samar, among others.
In our 2006 SONA, our food baskets were identified as North Luzon and Mindanao.
The sad irony of Mindanao as food basket is that it has some of the highest hunger in our nation. It has large fields of high productivity, yet also 6 of our 10 poorest provinces.
The prime reason is the endless Mindanao conflict. A comprehensive peace has eluded us for half a century. But last night, differences on the tough issue of ancestral domain were resolved. Yes, there are political dynamics among the people of Mindanao. Let us sort them out with the utmost sobriety, patience, and restraint. I ask Congress to act on the legislative and political reforms that will lead to a just and lasting peace during our term of office. [Applause]
The demands of decency and compassion urge dialogue. Better talk than fight, if nothing of sovereign value is anyway lost. Dialogue has achieved more than confrontation in many parts of the world. This was the message of the recent World Conference in Madrid organized by the King of Saudi Arabia, and the universal message of the Pope in Sydney.
Pope Benedict’s encyclical Deus Caritas Est reminds us: “There will always be situations of material need where help in the form of concrete love for neighbour is indispensable.”
Pinagsasama-sama natin ang mga programa ng DSWD, DOH, GSIS, SSS, at iba pang lumalaban sa kahirapan sa isang National Social Welfare Program para proteksyonan ang pinakamahihirap mula sa pandaigdigang krisis, and to help those whose earnings are limited by illness, disability, loss of job, age, and so on—through livelihood projects, microfinance, skills and technology transfer, emergency and temporary employment, pension funds, food aid and cash subsidies, child nutrition and adult health care, medical missions, salary loans, insurance, housing programs, educational and other savings schemes, and now cheaper medicine—thanks to Congress. [Applause]
The World Bank says that in Brazil, the income of the poorest 10% has grown 9% per year versus the 3% for the higher income levels due in large part to their family stipend program linking welfare checks to school attendance. We have introduced a similar program, Pantawid Pamilya.
Employers have funded the two increases in SSS benefits since 2005. Thank you, employers, for paying the premiums. [Applause]
GSIS pensions have been indexed to inflation and have increased every year since 2001. Its salary loan availments have increased from two months equivalent to 10 months, the highest of any system public or private—while repayments have been stretched out.
Pag-Ibig housing loans increased from P3.82 billion in 2001 to P22.6 billion in 2007. This year it experienced an 84% increase in the first four months alone. [Applause] Super heating na. Dapat dagdagan ng GSIS at buksan muli ng SSS ang pautang sa pabahay. I ask Congress to pass a bill allowing SSS to do housing loans beyond the present 10% limitation. [Applause]
Bago ako naging Pangulo, 1.5 milyong maralita lamang ang may health insurance. Noong 2001, sabi natin, dadagdagan pa ng kalahating milyon. Sa taong iyon, mahigit 1 milyon ang nabigyan natin. Ngayon, 65 milyong Pilipino na ang may health insurance, mahigit doble ng 2000, kasama ang 15 milyong maralita. [Applause] PhilHealth has paid P100 billion for hospitalization. The indigent beneficiaries largely come from Central and West Visayas, Central Luzon, and Ilocos. Patuloy nating palalawakin itong napaka-importanteng programa, lalo na sa Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga Norte, Maguindanao, Apayao, Dinagat, Lanao Sur, Northern Samar, Masbate, Abra, and Misamis Occidental. Lalo na sa kanilang mga magsasaka at mangingisda. [Applause]
In these provinces and in Agusan Sur, Kalinga, Surigao Sur, and calamity-stricken areas, we will launch a massive school feeding program at P10 per child every school day.
Bukod sa libreng edukasyon sa elementarya at high school, nadoble ang pondo para sa mga college scholarships, while private high school scholarship funds from the government have quadrupled.
I have started reforming and clustering the programs of the DepEd, CHED, and TESDA.
As with fiscal and food challenges, the global energy crunch demands better and more focused resource mobilization, conservation, and management.
Government agencies are reducing their energy and fuel bills by 10%, emulating Texas Instruments and Philippine Stock Exchange who did it last year. Congratulations, Justice Vitug and Francis Lim. [Applause]
To reduce power system losses, we count on government regulators and also on EPIRA amendments.
We are successful in increasing energy self-sufficiency—56%, the highest in our history. We promote natural gas and biofuel; geothermal fields, among the world’s largest; windmills like those in Ilocos and Batanes; and the solar cells lighting many communities in Mindanao. The new Galoc oil field can produce 17,000 to 22,000 barrels per day, 1/12 of our crude consumption.
The Renewable Energy Bill has passed the House. Thank you, Congressmen and Congresswomen. [Applause]
Our costly commodity imports like oil and rice should be offset by hard commodities exports like primary products, and soft ones like tourism and cyberservices, at which only India beats us.
Our P350 million training partnership with the private sector should qualify 60,000 for call centers, medical transcription, animation, and software development, which have a projected demand of 1 million workers generating $13 billion by 2010.
International finance agrees with our progress. Credit rating agencies have kept their positive or stable outlook on the country. Our world competitiveness ranking rose five notches. Congratulations to us. [Applause]
We are sticking to, and widening, the fiscal reforms that have earned us their respect.
To our investors, thank you for your valuable role in our development. [Applause] I invite you to invest not only in factories and services, but in profitable infrastructure, following the formula for the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway. [Applause]
I ask business and civil society to continue to work for a socially equitable, economically viable balance of interests. Mining companies should ensure that host communities benefit substantively from their investments, and with no environmental damage from operations. [Applause]
Our administration enacted the Solid Waste Management Act, Wildlife Act, Protection of Plant Varieties, Clean Water Act, Biofuels Act, and various laws declaring protected areas.
For reforestation, for next year we have budgeted P2 billion. [Applause] Not only do forests enhance the beauty of the land, they mitigate climate change, a key factor in increasing the frequency and intensity of typhoons and costing the country 0.5% of the GDP. [Applause]
We have set up over 100 marine and fish sanctuaries since 2001. In the whale shark sanctuary of Donsol [Sorsogon], Alan Amanse, a 40-year-old college undergraduate and father of two, was earning P100 a day from fishing and driving a tricycle. Now as whale shark-watching officer, he earns P1,000 a day, 10 times his former income. [Applause]
For clean water, so important to our health, there is P500 million this year and P1.5 billion for next year.
From just one sanitary landfill in 2001, we now have 21, with another 18 in the works.
We launched the Zero Basura Olympics to clear our communities of trash. Rather than more money, all that is needed is for each citizen to keep home and workplace clean, and for garbage officials to stop squabbling. [Applause]
Our investments also include essential ways to strengthen our institutions of governance in order to fight the decades-old scourge of corruption. I will continue to fight this battle every single day. [Applause] While others are happy with headlines through accusation without evidence and privilege speeches without accountability, we have allocated more than P3 billion—the largest anti-graft fund in our history—for real evidence gathering and vigorous prosecution. [Applause]
From its dismal past record, the Ombudsman’s conviction rate has increased 500%. [Applause] Lifestyle checks, never seriously implemented before our time, have led to the dismissal and/or criminal prosecution of dozens of corrupt officials. [Applause]
I recently met with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. agency that provides grants to countries based on governance. They have commended our gains, contributed P1 billion to our fight against graft, and declared us eligible for more grants. Thank you! [Applause]
Last September, we created the Procurement Transparency Group in the DBM and linked it with business, academe, and the Church, to deter or catch anomalies in government contracts.
On my instruction, the BIR and Customs established similar government-civil society tie-ups for information gathering and tax evasion and smuggling monitoring.
More advanced corruption practices require a commensurate advances in legislative responses. Colleagues in Congress, we need a more stringent Anti-Graft Act. [Applause]
Sa pagmahal ng bilihin, hirap na ang mamimili—tapos, dadayain pa. Dapat itong mahinto. Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na magpasa ng Consumer Bill of Rights laban sa price gouging, false advertising, at iba pang gawain kontra sa mamimili. [Applause]
I call on all our government workers at the national and local levels to be more responsive and accountable to the people. Panahon ito ng pagsubok. Kung saan kayang tumulong at dapat tumulong ang pamahalaan, we must be there with a helping hand. Where government can contribute nothing useful, stay away. Let’s be more helpful, more courteous, more quick.
Kaakibat ng ating mga adhikain ang tuloy na pagkalinga sa kapakanan ng bawat Pilipino. Iisa ang ating pangarap—maunlad at mapayapang lipunan, kung saan ang magandang kinabukasan ay hindi pangarap lamang, bagkus natutupad. [Applause]
Sama-sama tayo sa tungkuling ito. May papel na gagampanan ang bawat mamamayan, negosyante, pinunong bayan, at simbahan, sampu ng mga nasa lalawigan.
We are three branches but one government. We have our disagreements; we each have hopes, and ambitions that drive and divide us, be they personal, ethnic, religious, and cultural. But we are one nation with one fate. [Applause]
As your President, I care too much about this nation to let anyone stand in the way of our people’s well-being. Hindi ko papayagang humadlang ang sinuman sa pag-unlad at pagsagana ng taong bayan. [Applause] I will let no one—and no one’s political plans—threaten our nation’s survival. [Applause]
Our country and our people have never failed to be there for us. We must be there for them now. [Applause]
Maraming salamat. Magandang gabi sa inyong lahat. [Applause] [Standing ovation]

FULL TRANSCRIPT:
Ninth State of the Nation Address of Her Excellency Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo President of the Philippines During the Opening of the 3rd Regular Session of the 14th Congress
[Delivered in the Batasang Pambansa, Quezon City on July 27, 2009]
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon. Before I begin my report to the nation, please join me first in a moment of prayer for President Aquino.
Senate President Enrile, Speaker Nograles, Senators, Representatives, Vice President de Castro, former President Ramos, Chief Justice Puno, Ambassadors, friends:
The past 12 months have been a year for the history books. Financial meltdown in the West spread throughout the world. Tens of millions lost their jobs; billions across the globe have been hurt—the poor always harder than the rich. No one was spared.
It has affected us already. But the story of the Philippines in 2008 is that the country weathered a succession of global crises in fuel, in food, then in finance and finally, economy in a global recession, never losing focus and with economic fundamentals intact. [Applause]
A few days ago, Moody’s upgraded our credit rating, citing the resilience of our economy. The state of our nation is a strong economy. [Applause] Good news for our people, bad news for our critics. [Applause]
I did not become President to be popular. To work, to lead, to protect and preserve our country, our people, that is why I became President. [Applause] When my father left the Presidency, we were second to Japan. I want our Republic to be ready for the first world in 20 years.
Towards that vision, we made key reforms. Our economic plan centers on putting people first. Higit sa lahat, ang layunin ng ating patakaran ay tulungan ang masisipag na karaniwang Pilipino. [Applause] New tax revenues were put in place to help pay for better health care, more roads, and a strong education system. Housing policies were designed to lift up our poorer citizens so they can live and raise a family with dignity. Ang ating mga puhunan sa agrikultura ay naglalayong kilalanin ang ating mga magsasaka bilang backbone ng ating bansa, [applause] at bigyan sila ng mga modernong kagamitan to feed our nation and feed their own family.
Had we listened to the critics of those policies, had we not braced ourselves for the crisis that came, had we taken the easy road much preferred by politicians eyeing elections, this country would be flat on its back. [Applause] It would take twice the effort just to get it back again on its feet—to where we are now because we took the responsibility and paid the political price of doing the right thing. [Applause] For standing with me and doing the right thing, thank you, Congress.
The strong, bitter, and unpopular revenue measures of the past few years have spared our country the worst of the global financial shocks. They gave us the resources to stimulate the economy. Nabigyan nila ang pinakamalaking pagtaas ng IRA ng mga LGU na P40 billion itong taon, imparting strength throughout the country at every level of government.
Compared to the past, we have built more and better infrastructure, including those started by others but left unfinished. The Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway is a prime example of building better roads. [Applause] It creates wealth as the flagship of the Subic-Clark corridor.
We have built airports of international standard, upgraded domestic airports, built seaports and the Roll On/Roll Off system. I ask Congress for a Philippine Transport Security Law. [Applause]
Some say that after this SONA, it will be all politics. Sorry, but there’s more work. [Applause]
Sa telecommunications naman, inatasan ko ang Telecommunications Commission na kumilos na tungkol sa mga sumbong na dropped calls at mga nawawalang load sa cell phone. [Applause] We need to amend the Commonwealth-era Public Service Law. And we need to do it now. [Applause]
Kung noong nakaraan, lumakas ang electronics, today we are creating wealth by developing the BPO and tourism sectors as additional engines of growth. Electronics and other manufactured exports rise and fall in accordance with the state of the world economy. But BPO remains resilient. With earnings of $6 billion and employment of 600,000, the BPO phenomenon speaks eloquently of our competitiveness and productivity. [Applause] Let us have a Department of ICT. [Applause]
In the last four years, tourism almost doubled. [Applause] It is now a $5 billion industry.
Our reforms gave us the resources to protect our people, our financial system, and our economy from the worst of shocks that the best in the West failed to anticipate. [Applause]
They gave us the resources to extend welfare support and enhance spending power.
For helping me raise government salaries through Joint Resolution 4, thank you, Congress. [Applause]
Cash handouts give the most immediate relief and produce the widest stimulating effect. Nakikinabang ang 700,000 na pinakamahihirap na pamilya sa programang Pantawid Pamilya. [Applause]
We prioritize projects with the same stimulus effects plus long-term contributions to progress.
Sa pagpapamahagi ng milyun-milyong ektaryang lupa, 700,000 na katutubo at mahigit 1 milyong benepisyaryo ng CARP ay taas-noong may-ari na ng sariling lupa. [Applause] Hinihiling ko sa Kongreso na ipasa agad ang pagpapalawig ng CARP, [applause] at dapat ma-condone ang P42 billion na land reform liabilities dahil 18% lamang ang nabayaran mula 1972. [Applause] Napapanahon, because it will unfreeze the rural property market. Ang mahal kong ama ang nag-emancipate ng mga magsasaka. Ii-mancipate naman natin ngayon ang titulo. [Applause]
Nakinabang ang pitong milyong entrepreneurs sa P165 billion in microfinance loans.
Nakinabang ang 100,000 sa Emergency Employment ng ating Economic Resiliency Plan. Kasama natin ngayon ang isa sa kanila, si Gigi Gabiola. Dating household service worker sa Dubai, ngayon siya ay nagtatrabaho sa DOLE. Good luck, Gigi. [Applause]
Nakinabang ang 1 milyong pamilya sa programang pabahay at palupa, mula Pag-Ibig, NHA, Community Mortgage Program, Certificates of Lot Award, at saka yung inyong Loan Condonation and Restructuring Act. Salamat. [Applause]
Our average inflation is the lowest since 1966. Last June, it dropped to 1.5%. [Applause] Paano?
Proper policies lowered interest rates, which lowered costs to business and consumers.
Dahil sa ating mga reporma, nakaya nating ibenta ang bigas NFA sa P18.25 per kilo, kahit tumaas ang presyo sa labas mula P17.50 hanggang P30 dahil sa kakulangan sa supply sa mundo. Habang, sa unang pagkakataon, naitaas ang pamimili ng palay sa mga magsasaka, P17 mula sa P11.
Dahil sa ating mga reporma, nakaya nating mamuhunan sa pagkain—anticipating an unexpected global food crisis. Nakagawa tayo ng libu-libong kilometro ng farm-to-market roads at, kasama ng pribadong sector, natubigan ang 2 milyong ektarya. [Applause] Mga Badjao gaya ni Tarnati Dannawi ay tinuruan ng modernong mariculture. Umabot na sa P180,000 ang kinita niya mula noong nakaraang taon. Congratulations, Tarnati. [Applause] We will help more fisherfolk shift to fish farming with a budget of P1 billion. [Applause]
Dahil dumarami na naman daw ang pamilyang nagugutom, mamumuhunan tayo ng panibago sa ating Hunger Mitigation Program na sa nakaraan ay napatunayang mabisa. Tulungan ninyo ako dito, Kongreso. [Applause]
Mula pa noong 2001, nanawagan na tayo ng mas murang gamot. Nagbebenta tayo ng gamot na kalahating presyo sa libu-libong Botika ng Bayan at Botika ng Barangay sa maraming dako ng bansa. Our efforts prodded the pharmaceutical companies to come up with low-cost generics and brands like RiteMed. I supported the tough version of the House of the Cheaper Medicine law. [Applause] I supported it over the weak version of my critics. [Applause] The result: the drug companies volunteered to bring down drug prices, slashing by half the prices of 16 drugs. Thank you, Congressmen Cua, Alvarez, Biron, Locsin. [Applause]
Pursuant to law, we are placing other drugs under a maximum retail price. To those who want to be President, this advice: If you really want something done, just do it. Do it hard, do it well. Don’t pussyfoot. Don’t pander. And don’t say bad words in public. [Applause]
Sa health insurance, sakop na ng 86% ang ating populasyon.
Sa Rent Control Law ng 2005 hanggang 2008, di pwedeng lumampas ng 10% ang pagtaas ng upa taun-taon. Ayon sa kapipirma nating batas, may isang taong moratorium, tapos hanggang 7% lamang ang maaaring pagtaas. Salamat, Kongreso. [Applause]
Noong isang taon, nabiyayaan ng tig-P500 ang mahigit pitong milyong tahanan bilang Pantawid Kuryente sa mga small electricity users.
Yung presyo ng kuryente, ang EPIRA natin ang pangmatagalang sagot. EPIRA dismantled monopoly. Ngunit minana natin ang Power Purchase Agreements, kaya hindi pa natin nakakamtan yung buong intended effect. Pero happy na rin tayo, dahil isang taon na lamang iyan. The next generation will benefit from low prices from our EPIRA. Thank you. [Applause]
Samantala, umabot na sa halos lahat ng barangay ang elektrisidad. We increased indigenous energy from 48% to 58%. Nakatipid tayo ng dollars tapos malaki pa ang na-reduce na oil consumption. The huge reduction in fossil fuel is the biggest proof of energy independence and environmental responsibility. [Applause] Further reduction will come with the implementation of the Renewable Energy Act, and the Biofuels Act. Again, thank you. [Applause]
The next generation will also benefit from our lower public debt-to-GDP ratio. It declined from 78% in 2000 to 55% in 2008. We cut in half the debt of government corporations from 15% to 7%; likewise foreign debt from 73% to 32%. [Applause] Kung meron man tayong malaking kaaway na tinalo, walang iba kundi ang utang, iyong foreign debt. Those in the past conjured the demon of foreign debt. We exorcised it. [Applause]
The market grows economies. A free market, not a free-for-all.
To that end, we improved our banking system to complement its inherent conservatism. The Bangko Sentral has been prudent. Thank you, Governor Tetangco, [applause] for being so effective. The BSP will be even more effective if Congress will amend its Charter. [Applause]
We worked on the Special Purpose Vehicle Act, reducing nonperforming loans from 18% to 4% and improving loan-deposit ratios.
Our new Securitization Law did not encourage the recklessness that brought down giant banks and insurance companies elsewhere and laid their economies to waste. In fact, it monitors and regulates the newfangled financial schemes. Thank you, Congress. [Applause]
We will work to increase tax effort through improved collections and new sin taxes to further our capacity to reduce poverty and pursue growth. Revenue enhancement must come from the Department of Finance plugging leaks and catching tax and customs cheats. I call on tax-paying citizens and tax-paying businesses: help the BIR and customs stop those cheats. [Applause]
Taxes should come from alcohol and tobacco, and not from books. Tax hazards to lungs and livers, do not tax minds. [Applause] Ang kita mula sa buwis sa alak at sigarilyo ay dapat gamitin sa kalusugan at edukasyon. Pondohan ang PhilHealth premiums ng pinakamahihirap. Pondohan ang mas maraming classroom at computers.
Pardon my partiality for the teaching profession. I was a teacher, [applause] kaya namuhunan tayo ng malaki sa education at skills training.
Ang magandang edukasyon ay susi sa mas magandang buhay, the great equalizer that allows every young Filipino a chance to realize their dreams.
Nagtayo tayo ng 95,000 na silid-aralan, nagdagdag ng 60,000 na guro, naglaan ng P1.5 billion para sa teacher training, especially for 100,000 English teachers. [Applause]
Isa sa pinakamahirap sa Millennium Development Goals ay iyong education para sa lahat pagdating ng 2015. Ibig sabihin, lahat ng nasa tamang edad ay dapat nasa primary school. Halos walang bansang nakakatupad nito, ngunit nagsisikap pa rin tayo. Nagtayo tayo ng mga paaralan sa higit 1,000 barangay na dati walang eskwelahan upang makatipid ng gastos sa pasahe ang mga bata. [Applause] Tinanggal natin ang miscellaneous fees para sa primary school. Hindi na kailangan ang uniporme sa estudyante sa public school.
In private high schools, we finance half of the students.
We have provided college and postgraduate education for over 600,000 scholars. One of them, Mylene Amerol-Macumbal, finished Accounting at MSU-IIT, [applause] then she went to law school, and placed second in the last bar exams [applause]—the first Muslim woman bar topnotcher. Congratulations! [Applause]
In technical education and skills training, we have invested three times that of three previous administrations combined. [Applause] Narito si Jennifer Silbor, isa sa 10 milyong trainee. Natuto siya ng medical transcription. Now, as an independent contractor and lecturer for transcriptions in Davao, kumikita siya ng P18,000 bawat buwan. Good job, Jennifer. [Applause]
The Presidential Task Force on Education, headed by Jesuit educator Father Bienvenido Nebres, has come out with the Main Education Highway towards a Knowledge-Based Economy. It envisions seamless education from basic to vocational school or college.
It seeks to mainstream early childhood development in basic education. Our children are our most cherished possession. In their early years we must make sure they get a healthy start in life. They must receive the right food for a healthy body, the right education for a bright and inquiring mind—and the equal opportunity for a meaningful job. [Applause]
For college admission, the Task Force recommends mandatory Scholastic Aptitude Tests. It also recommends that higher private education institutions and state universities and colleges should be harmonized, and also that CHED should oversee local universities and colleges. For professions seeking international recognition—engineering, architecture, accountancy, pharmacy, and physical therapy—the Task Force recommends radical reform: 10 years of basic education, 2 years of pre-university, before 3 years of university.
Our educational system should make the Filipino fit not just for whatever jobs happen to be on offer today, but also for whatever economic challenge life will throw in their way.
Sa hirap at ginhawa, pinapatatag ang ating bansa ng ating overseas Filipinos. Iyong padala nilang $16 billion noong isang taon ay record. Itong taon, mas mataas pa. [Applause]
I know that this is not a sacrifice joyfully borne. This is work where it can be found—in faraway places, among strangers with different cultures. It is lonely work, it is hard work.
Kaya nagsisikap tayong lumikha dito sa atin ng mga trabahong maganda ang sahod, so that overseas work will just be a career choice, not the only option for a hardworking Filipino. [Applause]
Meanwhile, we should make their sacrifices worthwhile. Dapat gumawa tayo ng mas epektibong proteksyon at pagpapalawak ng halaga ng kanilang pinagsikapang suweldo. That means stronger consumer protection for overseas Filipinos investing in property and products back home. Para sa kanila, pinapakilos natin ang Investors Protection Task Force. [Applause]
Hindi ako nag-aatubiling bisitahin ang ating taong bayan at kanilang mga host sa buong mundo—mula Hapon hanggang Brazil, mula Europa at Middle East hanggang sa American Midwest, nakikinig sa kanilang mga problema at pangangailangan, inaalam kung paano sila matutulungan ng ating pamahalaan—by working out better policies on migrant labor, or by saving lives and restoring liberty.
Pagpunta ko sa Saudi, pinatawad ni Haring Abdullah ang 700 OFW na nasa preso. [Applause] Pinuno nila ang isang buong eroplano at umuwi kasama ko. [Applause]
Mula sa ating State Visit sa Espanya, it has become our biggest European donor. [Applause] At si Haring Juan Carlos ay nakikipag-usap sa ibang mga bansa para sa ating mga namomroblemang OFW. Ganoon din si Sheikh Khalifa, ang Prime Minister ng Bahrain. [Applause]
Pagpunta ko sa Kuwait, Emir Al-Sabah commuted death sentences. [Applause] We thank all our leaders, all the world leaders, who have shown compassion for our overseas Filipino workers. Maraming salamat. [Applause]
Our vigorous international engagement has helped bring in foreign investment. Net foreign direct investments multiplied 15 times during our administration. Kasama ng ating mga OFWs, they more than doubled our foreign exchange reserves. Pinalakas ang ating piso at naiwasan ang lubhang pagtaas ng presyo. They upgraded our credit because while the reserves of our peers have shrunk this past year, our reserves grew by $3 billion. [Applause]
Our international engagement has also corrected historical injustice. The day we visited Washington, Senator Daniel Inouye successfully sponsored benefits for our veterans as part of America’s stimulus package.
I have accepted the invitation of President Obama to be the first Southeast Asian leader to meet him at the White House, later this week. [Applause]
That he sought out the Philippines testifies to our strong and deep ties.
High on our agenda will be peace and security issues. Terrorism: how to meet it, how to end it, how to address its roots in injustice and prejudice—and first and always how to protect lives.
We will discuss nuclear nonproliferation. The Philippines will chair the review of the Nuclear Weapons Nonproliferation Treaty in New York in May 2010. The success of the talks will be a major diplomatic achievement for us.
There is a range of other issues we will discuss, including the global challenge of climate change, especially the threat to countries with long coastlines. And there is the global recession, its worse impact on poor people, and the options that can spare them from the worst.
In 2008 up to the first quarter of 2009, we stood among only a few economies in Asia Pacific that did not shrink. [Applause] Compare this to 2001, when some of my current critics were driven out by People Power. Asia was then surging but our country was on the brink of bankruptcy. [Applause]
Since then, our economy posted uninterrupted growth for 33 quarters; more than doubled its size from $76 billion to $186 billion. The average GDP growth from 2001 to the first quarter of 2009 is the highest in 43 years. [Applause]
Bumaba ang bilang ng mga nagsasabing mahirap sila sa 47% mula 59%. Maski lumaki ang ating populasyon, nabawasan ng 2 milyon ang bilang ng mahihirap. [Applause] GNP per capita rose from a Third World $967 to $2,000. Lumikha tayo ng 8 milyong trabaho, an average of a million a year—much, much more than at any other time. [Applause]
In sum:
First, we have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position to withstand political shocks.
Second, we built new and modern infrastructure and completed unfinished ones.
Third, the economy is more fair to the poor than ever before. [Applause]
Fourth, we are building a sound base for the next generation.
Fifth, international authorities have taken notice that we are safer from environmental degradation and man-made disasters.
As a country in the path of typhoons and in the Pacific Rim of Fire, we must be prepared as the latest technology permits to anticipate natural calamities when that is possible; to extend immediate and effective relief when it is not. The mapping of flood- and landslide-prone areas is almost complete. Early warning, forecasting, and monitoring systems have been improved, with weather tracking facilities in Subic, Tagaytay, Mactan, Mindanao, Pampanga.
We have worked on flood control infrastructure like those for Pinatubo, Agno, Laoag, and Abucay, which will pump the run off waters from Quezon City and Tondo flooding Sampaloc. This will help relieve hundreds of hectares in this old city of its age-old woe. [Applause]
Patuloy naman iyong sa Camanava, dagdag sa Pinatubo, Iloilo, Pasig-Marikina, Bicol River Basin, at mga river basin ng Mindanao.
The victims of typhoon Frank in Panay should receive their long-overdue assistance package. I ask Congress to pass the SNITS Law. [Applause]
Namana natin ang pinakamatagal na rebelyon ng Komunista sa buong mundo.
Si Leah de la Cruz isa sa labindalawang libong rebel returnee. Sixteen pa lang siya nang sumali sa NPA. Naging kasapi sa regional White Area Committee, napromote sa Leyte Party Committee Secretary. Nahuli noong 2006. She is now involved in an LGU-supported handicraft livelihood training of former rebels. We love you, Leah! [Applause]
There is now a good prospect for peace talks with both the Communist Party of the Philippines and the MILF, with whom we are now on ceasefire. [Applause]
We inherited an age-old conflict in Mindanao, exacerbated by a politically popular but nearsighted policy of massive retaliation. This only provoked the other side to continue the war.
In these two internal conflicts, ang tanong ay hindi, “Sino ang mananalo?” kundi, “Bakit pa ba kailangang maglaban ang kapwa Pilipino tungkol sa mga isyu na alam naman nating lahat na di malulutas sa dahas, at mareresolba lang sa paraang demokratiko?” [Applause]
There is nothing more that I would wish for than peace in Mindanao. It will be a blessing for all its people: Muslim, Christian, and Lumads. It will show other religiously divided communities that there can be common ground on which to live together in peace, harmony, and cooperation that respects each other’s religious beliefs. [Applause]
At sa lahat ng dako ng bansa, kailangan nating protektahan ang ating mga mamamayan kontra sa krimen—in their homes, in their neighborhoods, in their communities. How shall crime be fought? With the five pillars of justice, including crime fighters; we call on Congress to fund more policemen on the streets. [Applause]
Real government is about looking beyond the vested to the national interest, setting up the necessary conditions to enable the next, more enabled, and more empowered generation to achieve a country as prosperous, a people as content, as ours deserve to be. [Applause]
The noisiest critics of constitutional reform tirelessly and shamelessly attempted Cha-Cha when they thought they could take advantage of a shift in the form of government. Now that they feel they cannot benefit from it, they oppose it. [Applause]
As the seeds of fundamental political reform are planted, let us address the highest exercise of democracy—voting!
In 2001, I said we would finance fully automated elections. We got it, thanks to Congress. [Applause]
At the end of this speech I shall step down from this stage, but not from the Presidency. [Applause]  My term does not end until next year. [Applause] Until then, I will fight for the ordinary Filipino. The nation comes first. There is much to do as Head of State—to the very last day. [Applause]
A year is a long time. Patuloy ang pamumuhunan sa tinatawag na three E’s ng ekonomiya, environment, at edukasyon. There are many perils that we must still guard against.
A man-made calamity is already upon us, global in scale. As I said earlier, so far we have been spared its worst effects but we cannot be complacent. We only know that we have generated more resources on which to draw, and thereby created options we could take. Thank God we did not let our critics stop us. [Applause]
As the campaign unfolds and the candidates take to the airwaves, I ask them to talk more about how they will build up the nation rather than tear down their opponents. [Applause] Give the electorate real choices and not just sweet talk. [Applause]
Meanwhile, I will keep a steady hand on the tiller, keeping the ship of state away from the shallows some prefer, and steering it straight on the course we set in 2001.
Ang ating taong bayan ay masipag at maka-Diyos. These qualities are epitomized in someone like Manny Pacquiao. [Applause] Manny trained tirelessly, by the book, with iron discipline, with the certain knowledge that he had to fight himself, his weaknesses first, before he could beat his opponent. [Applause] That was the way to clinch his victories and his ultimate title: ang pinakadakilang boksingero sa kasaysayan. [Applause] Mabuhay ka, Manny! [Applause]
However much a President wishes it, a national problem cannot be knocked out with a single punch. A president must work with the problem as much as against it, turn it into a solution if she can.
There isn’t a day I do not work at my job, or a waking moment when I do not think through a work-related problem. Even my critics cannot begrudge the long hours I put in. Our people deserve a government that works just as hard as they do. [Applause]
A President must be on the job 24/7, ready for any contingency, any crisis, anywhere, anytime.
Everything right can be undone by even a single wrong. Every step forward must be taken in the teeth of political pressures and economic constraints that could push you two steps back—if you flinch and falter. I have not flinched, I have not faltered. Hindi ako umatras sa hamon. [Applause]
And I have never done any of the things that scared my worst critics so much. They are frightened by their own shadows. [Applause]
In the face of attempted coups, I issued emergency proclamations just in case. But I was able to resolve these military crises with the ordinary powers of my office. My critics call it dictatorship. I call it determination. [Applause]
We know it as strong government, but I never declared martial law, [applause] though they are running scared as if I did. In truth, what they are really afraid of is their weakness in the face of this self-imagined threat. [Applause]
I say to them: Do not tell us what we all know, that democracy can be threatened. Tell us what you will do when it is attacked. [Applause]
I know what to do:
As I have shown, I will defend democracy with arms when it is threatened by violence; with firmness when it is weakened by division; with law and order when it is subverted by anarchy; and always, I will try to sustain it by wise policies of economic progress, so that a democracy means not just an empty liberty but a full life for all. [Applause]
I have never expressed the desire to extend myself beyond my term. [Applause] Many of those who accuse me of it tried to cling like nails to their posts. [Applause]
I am accused of misgovernance. Many of those who accuse me of it left me the problem of their misgovernance to solve. [Applause] And we did it.
I am falsely accused, without proof, of using my position for personal profit. Many who accuse me have lifestyles and spending habits that make them walking proofs of that crime. [Applause]
We can read their frustrations. They had the chance to serve this good country and they blew it by serving themselves. [Applause]
Those who live in glass houses should cast no stones. Those who should be in jail should not threaten it, especially if they have been there. [Applause]
Our administration, with the highest average rate of growth, recording multiple increases in investments, with the largest job creation in history, and which gets a credit upgrade at the height of a world recession, must be doing something right, [applause] even if some of those cocooned in corporate privilege refuse to recognize it. [Applause]
Governance, however, is not about looking back and getting even. It is about looking forward and giving more—to the people who gave us the greatest, hardest gift of all: the care of a country. [Applause]
From Bonifacio at Balintawak to Cory Aquino at EDSA and up to today, we have struggled to bring power to the people, and this country to the eminence it deserves.
Today the Philippines is weathering well the storm that is raging around the world. It is growing stronger with the challenge. When the weather clears, as it will, there is no telling how much farther forward it can go. Believe in it. I believe. [Applause]
We can and we must march forward with hope, optimism, and determination.
We must come together, work together, and walk together toward the future. [Applause]
Bagamat malaking hamon ang nasa ating harapan, nasa kamay natin ang malaking kakayahan.[Applause] Halina’t pagtulungan nating tiyakin ang karapat-dapat na kinabukasan ng ating Inang Bayan. [Applause]
And to the people of our good country, for allowing me to serve as your President: Maraming salamat. [Applause] [Standing ovation]
Mabuhay ang Pilipinas! [Applause] [Standing ovation]

State of the Nation Address of His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III President of the Philippines To the Congress of the Philippines
Session Hall of the House of Representatives
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 26, 2010]
Maraming salamat po. Maupo po tayong lahat.
Speaker Feliciano Belmonte; Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile; Vice President Jejomar C. Binay; Chief Justice Renato Corona; Former Presidents Fidel Valdez Ramos and Joseph Ejercito Estrada; members of the House of Representatives and the Senate; distinguished members of the diplomatic corps; my fellow workers in government;
Mga minamahal kong kababayan:
Sa bawat sandali po ng pamamahala ay nahaharap tayo sa isang sangandaan.
Sa isang banda po ay ang pagpili para sa ikabubuti ng taumbayan. Ang pagtanaw sa interes ng nakakarami; ang pagkapit sa prinsipyo; at ang pagiging tapat sa sinumpaan nating tungkulin bilang lingkod-bayan. Ito po ang tuwid na daan.
Sa kabilang banda ay ang pag-una sa pansariling interes. Ang pagpapaalipin sa pulitikal na konsiderasyon, at pagsasakripisyo ng kapakanan ng taumbayan. Ito po ang baluktot na daan.
Matagal pong naligaw ang pamahalaan sa daang baluktot. Araw-araw po, lalong lumilinaw sa akin ang lawak ng problemang ating namana. Damang-dama ko ang bigat ng aking responsibilidad.
Sa unang tatlong linggo ng aming panunungkulan, marami po kaming natuklasan. Nais ko pong ipahayag sa inyo ang iilan lamang sa mga namana nating suliranin at ang ginagawa naming hakbang para lutasin ang mga ito.
Sulyap lamang po ito; hindi pa ito ang lahat ng problemang haharapin natin. Inilihim at sadyang iniligaw ang sambayanan sa totoong kalagayan ng ating bansa.
Sa unang anim na buwan ng taon, mas malaki ang ginastos ng gobyerno kaysa sa pumasok na kita. Lalong lumaki ang deficit natin, na umakyat na sa 196.7 billion pesos. Sa target na kuleksyon, kinapos tayo ng 23.8 billion pesos; ang tinataya namang gastos, nalagpasan natin ng 45.1 billion pesos.
Ang budget po sa 2010 ay 1.54 trillion pesos.
Nasa 100 bilyong piso o 6.5 porsyento na lang ng kabuuan ang malaya nating magagamit para sa nalalabing anim na buwan ng taong ito.
Halos 1 porsyento na lang po ng kabuuang budget ang natitira para sa bawat buwan.
Saan naman po dinala ang pera?
Naglaan ng 2 bilyong piso na Calamity Fund bilang paghahanda para sa mga kalamidad na hindi pa nangyayari. Napakaliit na nga po ng pondong ito, ngunit kapapasok pa lang natin sa panahon ng baha at bagyo, 1.4 billion pesos o 70 porsyento na ang nagastos.
Sa kabuuan ng 108 million pesos para sa lalawigan ng Pampanga, 105 million pesos nito ay napunta sa iisang distrito lamang. Samantala, ang lalawigan ng Pangasinan na sinalanta ng Pepeng ay nakatanggap ng 5 milyong piso lamang para sa pinsalang idinulot ng bagyong Cosme, na nangyari noong 2008 pa.
Ibinigay po ang pondo ng Pampanga sa buwan ng eleksyon, pitong buwan pagkatapos ng Ondoy at Pepeng. Paano kung bumagyo bukas? Inubos na ang pondo nito para sa bagyong nangyari noong isang taon pa. Pagbabayaran ng kinabukasan ang kasakiman ng nakaraan.
Ganyan din po ang nangyari sa pondo ng MWSS [Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]. Kamakailan lamang, pumipila ang mga tao para lang makakuha ng tubig. Sa kabila nito, minabuti pa ng liderato ng MWSS na magbigay ng gantimpala sa sarili kahit hindi pa nababayaran ang pensyon ng mga retiradong empleyado.
Noong 2009, ang buong payroll ng MWSS ay 51.4 million pesos. Pero hindi lang naman po ito ang sahod nila; may mga additional allowances at benefits pa sila na aabot sa 160.1 million pesos. Sa madaling sabi, nakatanggap sila ng 211.5 million pesos noong nakaraang taon. Beinte-kuwatro porsyento lang nito ang normal na sahod, at 66 porsyento ang dagdag.
Ang karaniwang manggagawa hanggang 13th month pay plus cash gift lang ang nakukuha. Sa MWSS, aabot sa katumbas ng mahigit sa 30 buwan ang sahod kasama na ang lahat ng mga bonuses at allowances na nakuha nila.
Mas matindi po ang natuklasan natin sa pasahod ng kanilang Board of Trustees. Tingnan po natin ang mga allowances na tinatanggap nila:
Umupo ka lang sa Board of Trustees at Board Committee meeting, 14,000 na. Aabot ng 98,000 ito kada buwan. May grocery incentive pa sila na 80,000 kada taon.
Hindi lang iyon: may mid-year bonus, productivity bonus, anniversary bonus, year-end bonus, at financial assistance. May Christmas bonus na, may additional Christmas package pa. Kada isa sa mga ito, 98,000.
Sa suma total po, aabot ang lahat ng 2.5 milyong piso kada taon sa bawat miyembro ng Board maliban sa pakotse, technical assistance, at pautang. Uulitin ko po. Lahat ng ito ay ibinigay nila sa kanilang mga sarili habang hindi pa nababayaran ang mga pensyon ng kanilang mga retirees.
Pati po ang La Mesa Watershed ay hindi nila pinatawad. Para magkaroon ng tamang supply ng tubig, kailangang alagaan ang mga watershed. Sa watershed, puno ang kailangan. Pati po iyon na dapat puno ang nakatayo, tinayuan nila ng bahay para sa matataas na opisyal ng MWSS.
Hindi naman sila agad maaalis sa puwesto dahil kabilang sila sa mga Midnight Appointees ni dating Pangulong Arroyo. Iniimbestigahan na natin ang lahat ng ito. Kung mayroon pa silang kahit kaunting hiya na natitira—sana kusa na lang silang magbitiw sa puwesto. [Applause]
Pag-usapan naman po natin ang pondo para sa imprastruktura. Tumukoy ang DPWH [Department of Public Works and Highways] ng 246 na priority safety projects na popondohan ng Motor Vehicle Users Charge. Mangangailangan po ito ng budget na 425 million pesos.
Ang pinondohan po, 28 proyekto lang. Kinalimutan po ang 218 proyekto at pinalitan ng 70 proyekto na wala naman sa plano. Ang hininging 425 million pesos, naging 480 million pesos pa, lumaki lalo dahil sa mga proyektong sa piling-piling mga benepisyaryo lang napunta.
Mga proyekto po itong walang saysay, hindi pinag-aralan, at hindi pinaghandaan, kaya parang kabuteng sumusulpot.
Tapos na po ang panahon para dito. Sa administrasyon po natin, walang kota-kota, walang tongpats, ang pera ng taumbayan ay gagastusin para sa taumbayan lamang. [Applause]
Meron pa po tayong natuklasan. Limang araw bago matapos ang termino ng nakaraang administrasyon, nagpautos silang maglabas ng 3.5 billion pesos para sa rehabilitasyon ng mga nasalanta nina Ondoy at Pepeng.
Walumpu’t anim na proyekto ang paglalaanan dapat nito na hindi na sana idadaan sa public bidding. Labingsiyam sa mga ito na nagkakahalaga ng 981 million pesos ang muntik nang makalusot. Hindi pa nailalabas ang Special Allotment Release Order ay pirmado na ang mga kontrata.
Buti na lang po ay natuklasan at pinigilan ito ni Secretary Rogelio Singson ng DPWH. Ngayon po ay dadaan na ang kabuuan ng 3.5 billion pesos sa tapat na bidding, at magagamit na ang pondo na ito sa pagbibigay ng lingap sa mga nawalan ng tahanan dahil kina Ondoy at Pepeng. [Applause]
Pag-usapan naman natin ang nangyari sa NAPOCOR [National Power Corporation]. Noong 2001 hanggang 2004, pinilit ng gobyerno ang NAPOCOR na magbenta ng kuryente nang palugi para hindi tumaas ang presyo. Tila ang dahilan: pinaghahandaan na nila ang eleksyon.
Dahil dito, noong 2004, sumagad ang pagkakabaon sa utang ng NAPOCOR. Napilitan ang pambansang gobyerno na sagutin ang 200 bilyong pisong utang nito.
Ang inakala ng taumbayan na natipid nila sa kuryente ay binabayaran din natin mula sa kaban ng bayan. May gastos na tayo sa kuryente, binabayaran pa natin ang dagdag na pagkakautang ng gobyerno.
Kung naging matino ang pag-utang, sana’y nadagdagan ang ating kasiguruhan sa supply ng kuryente. Pero ang desisyon ay ibinatay sa maling pulitika, at hindi sa pangangailangan ng taumbayan. Ang taumbayan, matapos pinagsakripisyo ay lalo pang pinahirapan.
Ganito rin po ang nangyari sa MRT [Metro Rail Transit]. Sinubukan na namang bilhin ang ating pagmamahal. Pinilit ang operator na panatilihing mababa ang pamasahe.
Hindi tuloy nagampanan ang garantiyang ibinigay sa operator na mababawi nila ang kanilang puhunan. Dahil dito, inutusan ang Land Bank at Development Bank of the Philippines na bilhin ang MRT.
Ang pera ng taumbayan, ipinagpalit sa isang naluluging operasyon.
Dumako naman po tayo sa pondo ng NFA [National Food Authority].
Noong 2004: 117,000 metric tons ang pagkukulang ng supply ng Pilipinas. Ang binili nila, 900,000 metric tons. Kahit ulitin mo pa ng mahigit pitong beses ang pagkukulang, sobra pa rin ang binili nila.
Noong 2007: 589,000 metric tons ang pagkukulang ng supply sa Pilipinas. Ang binili nila, 1.827 million metric tons. Kahit ulitin mo pa ng mahigit tatlong beses ang pagkukulang, sobra na naman ang binili nila.
Ang masakit nito, dahil sobra-sobra ang binibili nila taun-taon, nabubulok lang pala sa mga kamalig ang bigas, kagaya ng nangyari noong 2008.
Hindi po ba krimen ito, na hinahayaan nilang mabulok ang bigas, sa kabila ng 4 milyong Pilipinong hindi kumakain ng tatlong beses sa isang araw?
Ang resulta nito, umabot na sa 171.6 billion pesos ang utang ng NFA noong Mayo ng taong ito.
Ang tinapon na ito, halos puwede na sanang pondohan ang mga sumusunod:
Ang budget ng buong Hudikatura, na 12.7 billion pesos sa taong ito.
Ang Conditional Cash Transfers para sa susunod na taon, na nagkakahalaga ng 29.6 billion pesos.
Ang lahat ng classroom na kailangan ng ating bansa, na nagkakahalaga ng 130 billion pesos.
Kasuklam-suklam ang kalakarang ito. Pera na, naging bato pa.
Narinig po ninyo kung paano nilustay ang kaban ng bayan. Ang malinaw po sa ngayon: Ang anumang pagbabago ay magmumula sa pagsiguro natin na magwawakas na ang pagiging maluho at pagwawaldas.
Kaya nga po mula ngayon: ititigil na natin ang paglulustay sa salapi ng bayan. [Applause] Tatanggalin natin ang mga proyektong mali.
Ito po ang punto ng tinatawag nating zero-based approach sa ating budget. Ang naging kalakaran po, taun-taon ay inuulit lamang ang budget na puno ng tagas. Dadagdagan lang nang konti, puwede na.
Sa susunod na buwan ay maghahain tayo ng budget na kumikilala nang tama sa mga problema, at magtutuon din ng pansin sa tamang solusyon.
Ilan lang ito sa mga natuklasan nating problema. Heto naman po ang ilang halimbawa ng mga hakbang na ginagawa natin.
Nandiyan po ang kaso ng isang may-ari ng sanglaan. Bumili siya ng sasakyang tinatayang nasa 26 milyong piso ang halaga.
Kung kaya mong bumili ng Lamborghini, bakit hindi mo kayang magbayad ng buwis?
Nasampahan na po ito ng kaso. Sa pangunguna nina Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima, Justice Secretary Leila de Lima, BIR [Bureau of Internal Revenue] Commissioner Kim Henares at Customs Commissioner Lito Alvarez, [applause] bawat linggo po ay may bago tayong kasong isinasampa kontra sa mga smuggler at sa mga hindi nagbabayad ng tamang buwis. [Applause]
Natukoy na rin po ang salarin sa mga kaso nina Francisco Baldomero, Jose Daguio at Miguel Belen, tatlo sa anim na insidente ng extralegal killings mula nang umupo tayo.
Singkuwenta porsyento po ng mga insidente ng extralegal killings na nangyari sa maikling panahon ng ating panunungkulan ang patungo na sa kanilang resolusyon.
Ang natitira pong kalahati ay hindi natin tatantanan ang pag-usig hanggang makamit ang katarungan. [Applause]
Pananagutin natin ang mga mamamatay-tao. Pananagutin din natin ang mga corrupt sa gobyerno.
Nagsimula nang mabuo ang ating Truth Commission, sa pangunguna ni dating Chief Justice Hilario Davide. [Applause] Hahanapin natin ang katotohanan sa mga nangyari diumanong katiwalian noong nakaraang siyam na taon.
Sa loob ng linggong ito, pipirmahan ko ang kauna-unahang Executive Order na nagtatalaga sa pagbuo nitong Truth Commission.
Kung ang sagot sa kawalan ng katarungan ay pananagutan, ang sagot naman sa kakulangan natin sa pondo ay mga makabago at malikhaing paraan para tugunan ang mga pagkatagal-tagal nang problema.
Napakarami po ng ating pangangailangan: mula sa edukasyon, imprastruktura, pangkalusugan, pangangailangan ng militar at kapulisan, at marami pang iba. Hindi kakasya ang pondo para mapunan ang lahat ng ito.
Kahit gaano po kalaki ang kakulangan para mapunuan ang mga listahan ng ating pangangailangan, ganado pa rin ako dahil marami nang nagpakita ng panibagong interes at kumpyansa sa Pilipinas.
Ito ang magiging solusyon: mga Public-Private Partnerships. Kahit wala pa pong pirmahang nangyayari dito, masasabi kong maganda ang magiging bunga ng maraming usapin ukol dito.
May mga nagpakita na po ng interes, gustong magtayo ng expressway na mula Maynila, tatahak ng Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Nueva Vizcaya, hanggang sa dulo ng Cagayan Valley [applause] nang hindi gugugol ang estado kahit na po piso.
Sa larangan ng ating Sandatahang Lakas:
Mayroon po tayong 36,000 nautical miles na baybayin. Ang mayroon lamang tayo: 32 barko. Itong mga barkong ito, panahon pa ni Gen. MacArthur. [Laughter]
May nagmungkahi sa atin, ito ang proposisyon: uupahan po nila ang headquarters ng Navy sa Roxas Boulevard at ang Naval Station sa Fort Bonifacio.
Sagot po nila ang paglipat ng Navy Headquarters sa Camp Aguinaldo. Agaran, bibigyan tayo ng 100 milyong dolyar. At dagdag pa sa lahat nang iyan, magsusubi pa sila sa atin ng kita mula sa mga negosyong itatayo nila sa uupahan nilang lupa.
Sa madali pong sabi: Makukuha natin ang kailangan natin, hindi tatayo gagastos, kikita pa tayo. [Applause]
Marami na pong nag-alok at nagmungkahi sa atin, mula lokal hanggang dayuhang negosyante, na magpuno ng iba’t ibang pangangailangan.
Mula sa mga Public-Private Partnerships na ito, lalago ang ating ekonomiya, at bawat Pilipino makikinabang. Napakaraming sektor na matutulungan nito.
Maipapatayo na po ang imprastrukturang kailangan natin para palaguin ang turismo.
Sa agrikultura, makapagtatayo na tayo ng mga grains terminals, refrigeration facilities, maayos na road networks at postharvest facilities.
Kung maisasaayos natin ang ating food supply chain sa tulong ng pribadong sektor, sa halip na mag-angkat tayo ay maari na sana tayong mangarap na mag-supply sa pandaigdigang merkado.
Kung maitatayo ang minumungkahi sa ating mga railway system, bababa ang presyo ng bilihin. Mas mura, mas mabilis, mas maginhawa, at makakaiwas pa sa kotong cops at mga kumokotong na rebelde ang mga bumibiyahe. [Applause]
Paalala lang po: Una sa ating plataporma ang paglikha ng mga trabaho, at nanggagaling ang trabaho sa paglago ng industriya. Lalago lamang ang industriya kung gagawin nating mas malinis, mas mabilis, at mas maginhawa ang proseso para sa mga gustong magnegosyo.
Pabibilisin natin ang proseso ng mga proyektong sumasailalim sa Build-Operate-Transfer. Sa tulong ng lahat ng sangay ng gobyerno at ng mga mamamayan, pabababain natin sa anim na buwan ang proseso na noon ay inaabot ng taon kung hindi dekada.
May mga hakbang na rin pong sinisimulan ang DTI [Department of Trade and Industry], sa pamumuno ni Secretary Gregory Domingo:
Ang walang-katapusang pabalik-balik sa proseso ng pagrehistro ng pangalan ng kumpanya, na kada dalaw ay umaabot ng apat hanggang walong oras, ibababa na natin sa 15 minuto. [Applause]
Ang dating listahan ng 36 na dokumento, ibababa natin sa 6. Ang dating walong pahinang application form, ibababa natin sa isang pahina.
Nananawagan ako sa ating mga LGUs [local government units]. Habang naghahanap tayo ng paraan para gawing mas mabilis ang pagbubukas ng mga negosyo, pag-aralan din sana nila ang kanilang mga proseso. Kailangan itong gawing mas mabilis, at kailangan itong itugma sa mga sinisumulan nating reporma.
Negosyante, sundalo, rebelde, at karaniwang Pilipino, lahat po makikinabang dito. Basta po hindi dehado ang Pilipino, papasukin po natin lahat iyan. [Applause] Kailangan na po nating simulan ang pagtutulungan para makamit ito. Huwag nating pahirapan ang isa’t isa.
Parating na po ang panahon na hindi na natin kailangang mamili sa pagitan ng seguridad ng ating mamamayan o sa kinabukasan ng inyong mga anak.
Oras na maipatupad ang Public-Private Partnerships na ito, mapopondohan ang mga serbisyong panlipunan, alinsunod sa ating plataporma.
Magkakapondo na po para maipatupad ang mga plano natin sa edukasyon.
Mapapalawak natin ang basic education cycle mula sa napakaikling 10 taon tungo sa global standard na 12 taon.
Madadagdagan natin ang mga classroom. Mapopondohan natin ang service contracting sa ilalim ng GASTPE [Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in Private Education].
Pati ang conditional cash transfers, na magbabawas ng pabigat sa bulsa ng mga pamilya, madadagdan na rin ng pondo.
Maipapatupad ang plano natin sa PhilHealth.
Una, tutukuyin natin ang tunay na bilang ng mga nangangailangan nito. Sa ngayon, hindi magkakatugma ang datos. Sabi ng PhilHealth sa isang bibig, 87 porsyento na raw ang merong coverage. Sa kabilang bibig naman, 53 porsyento naman. Ayon naman sa National Statistics Office, 38 porsyento ang may coverage.
Ngayon pa lang, kumikilos na si Secretary Dinky Soliman at ang DSWD [Department of Social Welfare and Development] upang ipatupad ang National Household Targetting System, na magtutukoy sa mga pamilyang higit na nagangailangan ng tulong. Tinatayang 9 bilyon ang kailangan para mabigyan ng PhilHealth ang 5 milyong pinakamaralitang pamilyang Pilipino.
Napakaganda po ng hinaharap natin. Kasama na po natin ang pribadong sektor, at kasama na rin natin ang League of Provinces, sa pangunguna nina Governor Alfonso Umali kasama sina Governor L-Ray Villafuerte at Governor Icot Petilla. Handa na pong makipagtulungan para makibahagi sa pagtustos ng mga gastusin. Alam ko rin pong hindi magpapahuli ang League of Cities sa pangunguna ni Mayor Oscar Rodriguez. [Applause]
Kung ang mga gobyernong lokal ay nakikiramay na sa ating mga adhikain, ang Kongreso namang pinanggalingan ko, siguro naman maasahan ko din. [Applause]
Nagpakitang-gilas na po ang gabinete sa pagtukoy ng ating mga problema at sa paglulunsad ng mga solusyon sa loob lamang ng tatlong linggo.
Nang bagyo pong Basyang, ang sabi sa atin ng mga may prangkisa sa kuryente, apat na araw na walang kuryente. Dahil sa mabilis na pagkilos ni Secretary Rene Almendras at ng Department of Energy, naibalik ang kuryente sa halos lahat sa loob lamang ng 24 oras. [Applause]
Ito pong sinasabing kakulangan sa tubig sa Metro Manila, kinilusan agad ni Secretary Rogelio Singson at ng DPWH. Hindi na siya naghintay ng utos, kaya nabawasan ang perwisyo.
Nakita na rin natin ang gilas ng mga hinirang nating makatulong sa Gabinete. Makatuwiran naman po sigurong umasa na hindi na sila padadaanin sa butas ng karayom para makumpirma ng Commission on Appointments. Kung mangyayari po ito, marami pa sa mga mahuhusay na Pilipino ang maeengganyong magsilbi sa gobyerno.
Sa lalong madaling panahon po, uupo na tayo sa LEDAC [Legislative Executive Development Advisory Council] at pag-uusapan ang mga mahahalagang batas na kailangan nating ipasa. Makakaasa kayo na mananatiling bukas ang aking isipan, at ang ating ugnayan ay mananatiling tapat. [Applause]
Isinusulong po natin ang Fiscal Responsibility Bill, kung saan hindi tayo magpapasa ng batas na mangangailangan ng pondo kung hindi pa natukoy ang panggagalingan nito. May 104.1 billion pesos tayong kailangan para pondohan ang mga batas na naipasa na, ngunit hindi maipatupad.
Kailangan din nating isaayos ang mga insentibong piskal na ibinigay noong nakaraan. Ngayong naghihigpit tayo ng sinturon, kailangang balikan kung alin sa mga ito ang dapat manatili at kung ano ang dapat nang itigil.
Huwag po tayong pumayag na magkaroon ng isa pang NBN-ZTE. Sa lokal man o dayuhan manggagaling ang pondo, dapat dumaan ito sa tamang proseso. Hinihingi ko po ang tulong ninyo upang amiyendahan ang ating Procurement Law.
Ayon po sa Saligang Batas, tungkulin ng estado ang siguruhing walang lamangan sa merkado. Bawal ang monopolya, bawal ang mga cartel na sasakal sa kumpetisyon. Kailangan po natin ng isang Anti-Trust Law na magbibigay-buhay sa mga prinsipyong ito. Ito ang magbibigay ng pagkakataon sa mga Small- at Medium-scale Enterprises na makilahok at tumulong sa paglago ng ating ekonomiya.
Ipasa na po natin ang National Land Use Bill.
Una rin pong naging batas ng Commonwealth ang National Defense Act, na ipinasa noon pang 1935. Kailangan nang palitan ito ng batas na tutugon sa pangangailangan ng pambansang seguridad sa kasalukuyan.
Nakikiusap po akong isulong ang Whistleblower’s Bill upang patuloy nang iwaksi ang kultura ng takot at pananahimik. [Applause]
Palalakasin pa lalo ang Witness Protection Program. Alalahanin po natin na noong taong 2009 hanggang 2010, may nahatulan sa 95 percent ng mga kaso kung saan may witness na sumailalim sa programang ito.
Kailangang repasuhin ang ating mga batas. Nanawagan po akong umpisahan na ang rekodipikasyon ng ating mga batas, upang siguruhing magkakatugma sila at hindi salu-salungat.
Ito pong mga batas na ito ang batayan ng kaayusan, ngunit ang pundasyon ng lahat ng ginagawa natin ay ang prinsipyong wala tayong mararating kung walang kapayapaan at katahimikan.
Dalawa ang hinaharap nating suliranin sa usapin ng kapayapaan: ang situwasyon sa Mindanao, at ang patuloy na pag-aaklas ng CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front].
Tungkol sa situwasyon sa Mindanao: Hindi po nagbabago ang ating pananaw.  [Applause] Mararating lamang ang kapayapaan at katahimikan kung mag-uusap ang lahat ng apektado: Moro, Lumad, at Kristiyano. Inatasan na natin si Dean Marvic Leonen na mangasiwa sa ginagawa nating pakikipag-usap sa MILF [Moro Islamic Liberation Front].
Iiwasan natin ang mga pagkakamaling nangyari sa nakaraang administrasyon, kung saan binulaga na lang ang mga mamamayan ng Mindanao. [Applause] Hindi tayo puwedeng magbulag-bulagan sa mga dudang may kulay ng pulitika ang proseso, at hindi ang kapakanan ng taumbayan ang tanging interes.
Kinikilala natin ang mga hakbang na ginagawa ng MILF sa pamamagitan ng pagdidisplina sa kanilang hanay. Inaasahan natin na muling magsisimula ang negosasyon pagkatapos ng Ramadan. [Applause]
Tungkol naman po sa CPP-NPA-NDF: Handa na ba kayong maglaan ng kongkretong mungkahi, sa halip na pawang batikos lamang? [Applause]
Kung kapayapaan din ang hangad ninyo, handa po kami sa malawakang tigil-putukan. Kayo po ba ay handa rin? Mag-usap tayo. [Applause]
Mahirap magsimula ang usapan habang mayroon pang amoy ng pulbura sa hangin. Nananawagan ako: huwag po natin hayaang masayang ang napakagandang pagkakataong ito upang magtipon sa ilalim ng iisang adhikain.
Kapayapaan at katahimikan po ang pundasyon ng kaunlaran. Habang nagpapatuloy ang barilan, patuloy din ang pagkakagapos natin sa kahirapan.
Dapat din po nating mabatid: Ito ay panahon ng sakripisyo. At ang sakripisyong ito ang magiging puhunan para sa ating kinabukasan. Kaakibat ng ating mga karapatan at kalayaan ay ang tungkulin natin sa kapwa at sa bayan.
Inaasahan ko po ang ating mga kaibigan sa media, lalo na sa radyo at sa print, sa mga nagbablock-time, at sa community newspapers, kayo na po mismo ang magbantay sa inyong hanay.
Mabigyang-buhay sana ang mga batayang prinsipyo ng inyong bokasyon: ang magbigay-linaw sa mahahalagang isyu; ang maging patas at makatotohanan; at ang itaas ang antas ng pampublikong diskurso. [Applause]
Tungkulin po ng bawat Pilipino na tutukan ang mga pinunong tayo rin naman ang nagluklok sa puwesto. Humakbang mula sa pakikialam tungo sa pakikilahok. Dahil ang nakikialam, walang-hanggan ang reklamo. Ang nakikilahok, nakikibahagi sa solusyon. [Applause]
Napakatagal na pong namamayani ang pananaw na ang susi sa asenso ay ang intindihin ang sarili kaysa intindihin ang kapwa. Malinaw po sa akin: Paano tayo aasenso habang nilalamangan ang kapwa?
Ang hindi nabigyan ng pagkakataong mag-aral, paanong makakakuha ng trabaho? Kung walang trabaho, paanong magiging konsumer? Paanong mag-iimpok sa bangko?
Ngunit kung babaliktarin natin ang pananaw—kung iisipin nating, “Dadagdagan ko ang kakayahan ng aking kapwa”—magbubunga po ito, at ang lahat ay magkakaroon ng pagkakataon. [Applause]
Maganda na po ang nasimulan natin. At mas lalong maganda po ang mararating natin. Ngunit huwag nating kalimutan na mayroong mga nagnanasang hindi tayo magtagumpay. Dahil kapag hindi tayo nagtagumpay, makakabalik na naman sila sa kapangyarihan, at sa pagsasamantala sa taumbayan. [Applause]
Akin pong paniwala na Diyos at taumbayan ang nagdala sa ating kinalalagyan ngayon. Habang nakatutok tayo sa kapakanan ng ating kapwa, bendisyon at patnubay ay tiyak na maaasahan natin sa Poong Maykapal. At kapag nanalig tayo na ang kasangga natin ay ang Diyos, mayroon ba tayong hindi kakayanin?
Ang mandato nating nakuha sa huling eleksyon ay patunay na umaasa pa rin ang Pilipino sa pagbabago. Iba na talaga ang situwasyon. Puwede na muling mangarap. [Applause] Tayo nang tumungo sa katuparan ng ating mga pinangarap.
Maraming salamat po. Magandang hapon sa inyong lahat.

State of the Nation Address of His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III President of the Philippines To the Congress of the Philippines
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 25, 2011]
Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte; Bise Presidente Jejomar Binay; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Chief Justice Renato Corona at ang ating mga kagalang-galang na mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kasapi ng diplomatic corps; mga miyembro ng Kamara de Representante at ng Senado; mga local government officials; mga miyembro ng ating Gabinete; mga unipormadong kasapi ng militar at kapulisan; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan;
At sa mga minamahal kong kababayan, ang aking butihing mga Boss:
Humarap po ako sa inyo noong aking inagurasyon at sinabing: Walang wangwang sa ating administrasyon. At ngayon, patuloy nating itinitigil ito. Naging hudyat at sagisag po ito ng pagbabago, hindi lamang sa kalsada, kundi pati na rin sa kaisipan sa lipunan.
Sa matagal na panahon, naging simbolo ng pang-aabuso ang wangwang. Dati, kung makapag-counterflow ang mga opisyal ng pamahalaan, para bang oras lang nila ang mahalaga. Imbes na maglingkod-bayan, para bang sila ang naging hari ng bayan. Kung makaasta ang kanilang mga padrino’t alipores, akala mo’y kung sinong maharlika kung humawi ng kalsada; walang pakialam sa mga napipilitang tumabi at napag-iiwanan. Ang mga dapat naglilingkod ang siya pang nang-aapi. Ang panlalamang matapos mangakong maglingkod—iyan po ang utak-wangwang.
Wala silang karapatang gawin ito. Ayon sa batas, tanging ang Presidente, Bise Presidente, Senate President, House Speaker, Chief Justice, pulis, bumbero, at ambulansya lang ang awtorisadong gumamit ng wangwang para sa kanilang mga opisyal na lakad. Kung sa trapiko nga ay ‘di masunod ang batas, paano pa kaya sa mga bagay na mas malaki ang makukuha, tulad ng sa mga proyektong [applause] pinopondohan ng kaban ng bayan?
Kayo po ba gusto ninyong makulong ang lahat ng tiwali? Ako rin po. Gusto ba ninyong matanggal ang wangwang, hindi lamang sa kalsada, kundi sa kaisipang nagdulot ng baluktot na sistema na pagkatagal-tagal na nating pinagtiisan? Ako rin. Gusto po ba ninyong mabigyan ng patas na pagkakataon ang lahat na umasenso? Siyempre ako rin po.
Narito po ang halimbawa ng resulta ng ating kampanya kontra wangwang sa sistema. Nitong taong ito, taumbayan na mismo ang nagsabing nabawasan ang nagugutom sa kanila. Mula sa 20.5 percent na self-rated hunger noong Marso, bumaba na ito sa 15.1 percent nitong Hunyo, [applause] katumbas ng isang milyong pamilyang Pilipinong nagugutom dati, pero ngayon ay nakakakain na nang tama kada araw.
Sa larangan po ng negosyo, sino ba ang nag-akalang pitong ulit nating malalampasan ang all-time high ng stock market? Ang dating 4,000 index na inaakalang hindi maaabot, o kung maabot man ay pansamantala lang, ngayon, pangkaraniwan nang hinihigitan.
Kung dati napako na ang bansa sa mababang credit ratings, itinaas ng Moody’s, Standard and Poors, Fitch, at Japan Credit Ratings Agency ang ating ranking, bilang pagkilala sa ating tamang paggugol ng pondo at sa malikhain nating pananalapi. Ang mataas na credit rating, magpapababa ng interes sa perang inuutang natin. Kumpara sa unang apat na buwan ng nakaraang taon, mas malaki po ng 23 billion pesos ang natipid nating interest payments mula Enero hanggang Abril ng 2011. Maaari na po nitong sagutin ang dalawang milyon at tatlongdaan libong benepisyaryo ng CCT [conditional cash transfer] hanggang sa katapusan ng 2011. [Applause]
Paalala ko lang po, sa siyam at kalahating taon bago tayo maitalaga sa puwesto, iisang beses lang tayong nakatikim ng ratings upgrade, at anim na beses pang na-downgrade ng iba’t ibang ratings agency. Sa isang taon pa lang po natin, apat na beses na tayong nabigyan ng upgrade. [Applause] Alam naman po natin na hindi madaling ma-upgrade sa mga panahong ito. Itong mga ratings agency, nabatikos na mali raw ang payo bago magkakrisis sa Amerika, kaya ngayon ay mas makunat na sila sa pagbibigay ng magagandang ratings, at nakikita nga natin ito sa sunud-sunod na pag-downgrade sa ibang mga bansa. Pero tayo po, in-upgrade pa nila. Sang-ayon silang lahat: gumanda at lalo pang gaganda ang ekonomiya ng Pilipinas. Isang hakbang na lang po, aabot na raw tayo sa investment grade, at wala pong tigil ang ating economic team upang tuluyan na tayong makaarangkada.
At may mabubuting balita pa pong parating. Dahil wala nang wangwang sa DOE [Department of Energy], muling nabuhay ang kumpiyansa ng mga namumuhunan sa ating energy sector. Patunay dito ang isandaan at apatnapung kumpanya na nakahandang tumaya sa eksplorasyon at pagpapalakas ng ating oil at natural gas resources. Sa huling energy contracting round noong 2006, 35 lang po ang nakilahok. Nitong Biyernes lamang po, nilagdaan na ang panibagong kasunduan para sa isang bagong power plant sa Luzon grid upang pagdating ng 2014, may mas mura at mas maaasahang pagmumulan ng enerhiya ang bansa.
May kumpiyansa, may pag-asa, at tinutupad po natin ang ating mga pangako. Naaalala ko nga po ang babaeng nakausap ko nang ako’y unang nagha-house-to-house campaign para sa akin pong sarili. Ang kaniyang hinaing: “Maski sino naman ang manalo, pare-pareho lang ang kahihinatnan. Mahirap ako noong sila ay nangangampanya; mahirap ako habang nakaupo sila, at malamang mahirap pa rin ako ‘pag nagretiro na sila.” Sa madaling salita, ang hinaing po ng marami, “Walang pakialam ang mga pinuno namin kahapon, wala silang pakialam ngayon. Bukas, wala pa rin silang pakialam.”
‘Di po ba’t may katwiran naman siya sa pagsasabi nito, dahil sa pagwawangwang sa mga ahensya ng gobyerno? Wangwang po ang pagbili ng helicopter sa presyong brand new, pero iyon pala ay gamit na gamit na. [Applause] Wangwang din ang milyun-milyong pabuya na tinanggap ng mga opisyal ng GOCC [government-owned and -controlled corporation], tulad ng sa Philippine National Construction Corporation (PNCC), gayong hindi naman sila nakapaghandog ng disenteng serbisyo, at ibinaon pa sa utang ang kanilang mga ahensya. Bago sila bumaba sa puwesto, dalawandaan tatlumpu’t dalawang milyong piso po ang inomento ng dating pamunuan ng PNCC sa kanilang sarili. 2007 pa lang po, wala na silang prangkisa; lahat ng kikitain, dapat diretso na sa pambansang gobyerno. Hindi na nga nag-abot ng kita, sinamantala pa ang puwesto. Ang bonus nila mula 2005 hanggang 2009, dinoble pa nila sa unang anim na buwan ng 2010. Ibinaon na nga po nila sa bilyun-bilyong pisong utang ang kanilang tanggapan, nasikmura pa nilang magbigay ng midnight bonus sa sarili.
Para po pigilan ang pagwangwang sa kaban ng bayan, sinuyod at sinuri natin ang mga programa. Dalawang magkasunod na taon na po nating ipinatutupad ang zero-based budgeting, na magsisilbing kalasag sa walang-saysay na paggastos.
Sa Laguna Lake po, magtatanggal nga—sabi nila—ng 12 million cubic meters sa dredging, pero pagkatapos ng tatlong taon, garantisado naman itong babalik; 18.7 billion pesos ang magiging utang natin para lang maglaro ng putik. Hindi pa bayad ang utang, nag-expire na ang pakinabang. Pinigilan po natin iyan. Ang food-for-school program na bara-bara lang ang paghahanap ng benepisyaryo, at iba pang inisyatibang pinondohan ngunit walang pinatunguhan—binura na natin sa budget upang ang pera namang nalibre ay mailaan sa mga proyektong totoong may silbi.
Ang budget po ang pinakamalinaw na pagsasabuhay ng ating tuwid na landas. Ang aking pahiwatig sa lahat ng gusto pang ilihis tayo rito: Kung mang-aagrabyado ka lang ng mahirap, huwag ka nang magtangka. Kung sarili mo lang ang papayamanin mo, huwag ka nang magtangka. Kung hindi iyan para sa Pilipino, huwag ka nang magtangka.
Sana masabi na natin na tapos na ang utak-wangwang, pero nakikita po natin ang latak ng ganitong kaisipan na pilit bumubulahaw sa aliwalas ng ating biyahe sa tuwid na landas.
Mukhang marami rin po kasi ang nagwawangwang sa pribadong sektor. Ayon sa BIR [Bureau of Internal Revenue], mayroon tayong halos 1.7 million na self-employed at professional taxpayers gaya ng mga abogado, doktor, at negosyante na nagbayad lamang, sa sumatotal, ng 9.8 billion pesos noong 2010. 5,783 pesos lang ang ibinayad na income tax ng bawat isa raw sa kanila, on average—ang ibig-sabihin, kung totoo po ito, ang kabuuang kita nila ay umaabot lang ng 8,500 pesos kada buwan. Mababa pa sa minimum wage. Naman. [Applause]
Nakikita naman po ninyong napupunta na sa tama ang buwis ninyo, kaya wala na pong dahilan upang iwasan natin ang pagbabayad. Nananawagan po ako sa inyo: Hindi lang po gobyerno, kundi kapwa natin Pilipino ang pinagkakaitan sa hindi pagbabayad ng tamang buwis.
Pinananagot at pananagutin po natin ang wangwang saanmang sulok ng gobyerno. Ang masakit, hanggang sa mga araw pong ito, may sumusubok pa ring makalusot. Mayroon nga pong isang distrito sa Region IV-B, may proyektong gagastusan ng 300 million pesos. Kaso hanggang 50 million pesos lang ang puwedeng aprubahan ng district engineer.
Kaya naisip nilang i-chop-chop ang proyekto para ‘di lumampas sa 50 million pesos ang halaga, at ‘di na umabot sa regional at central office ang kanilang mga papeles. Kani-kaniyang diskarte, kani-kaniyang kaharian ang nadatnan nating sitwasyon sa DPWH [Department of Public Works and Highways]. Sinubukan nilang ipagpatuloy ang nakasanayan na nila. Kadalasan, dahil sa lumpsum na pagbibigay ng pondo, wala nang tanung-tanong kung ano ang plano at detalye ng proyekto. Maski yata—sabi ng iba—bahay ng gagamba ang ipatatayo, bibigyan ng pondo, basta may padrino.
Hindi ito pinalusot ni Secretary Babes Singson. [Applause] Tinanggal na niya sa puwesto ang district engineer. Pinigilan din po ang pag-award ng proyektong ito para busisiin kung ano pang magic ang nangyari. Masusi na ring iniimbestigahan lahat ng nagkuntsabahan. Ang mga kontratistang mapatunayang nakipagsabwatan para mag-tongpats sa mga proyekto, iba-blacklist natin.
Tingnan nga po ninyo ang idinulot na perhuwisyo ng pagwawangwang sa sistema: Tuloy ang pagdusa ng mamamayang dapat nakikinabang na sa proyekto ng bayan.
Hindi lang po iyan sa Region IV-B nadiskubre. Ngunit natigil na po ito dahil hindi na padrino kundi tamang proseso ang naghahari sa DPWH. Hindi na puwedeng walang work program; kailangang magpakita ng pinag-isipang plano para hindi magkasalungat ang pagsasagawa ng mga proyekto. Malinis at hayag na ang bidding, at pantay na ang pagkakataon sa pagpasok ng mga kontratista.
Sa sistemang pinaiiral ngayon sa DPWH, nakatipid na tayo ng 2.5 bilyong piso, at umaasa tayo na aabot pa sa 6 hanggang 7 bilyong piso ang matitipid sa taon na ito. Ang pinakamahalaga po, nakakaasa na tayo sa mga kalsadang matino, hindi ‘yung maambunan lang ay lulundo o mabibiyak agad. Paniwala natin dati, imposibleng maitama ng DPWH ang sistema nila. Hindi lang po ito posible; sa unang taon pa lamang, ginagawa na natin ito.
Kahit po sa mga bukirin, may mga nagwawangwang din. Bago tayo maupo noong 2010, nag-angkat ang bansa ng 2.3 million metric tons ng bigas. 1.3 million metric tons lamang ang kailangan nating angkatin, ngunit pinasobrahan pa nila ito ng 1 milyong tonelada. Dahil nga sobra-sobra ang inangkat, kinailangan pa nating gumastos muli sa mga bodegang pagtatambakan lang naman ng barku-barkong bigas.
Ilang taon bang walang saysay na pinasobrahan ang bigas na inaangkat? Dahil dito, umiral ang pag-iisip na habambuhay na tayong aangkat ng bigas. Ang akala ng marami, wala na talaga tayong magagawa.
Ngunit, sa loob lamang ng isang taon, pinatunayan nating mali sila. Ngayon, ang dating 1.3 million metric tons na kakulangan natin sa bigas, halos nangalahati na; 660,000 metric tons na lang [applause] po ang kailangan nating angkatin. Kahit dagdagan pa natin iyan ng panangga laban sa sakuna at gawing 860,000 metric tons—na ginagawa na nga po natin—mas mababa pa rin ito sa tinatayang taunang kakulangan na 1.3 million metric tons.
At hindi po buwenas lang ang nangyaring pag-angat ng ating rice productivity. Bunga po ito ng matinong pamamalakad: ng paggamit ng maiinam na klase ng binhi, at masusi at epektibong paggastos para sa irigasyon. Nito nga pong nakaraang taon, 11,611 bagong ektarya ng bukirin ang napatubigan natin. Dagdag pa iyan sa halos 212,000 ektarya na nakumpuni o nabigyang muli ng irigasyon matapos ang panahon ng pagkakatiwangwang. Ang resulta: umangat ng 15.6 percent ang inani nating palay noong nakaraang taon.
Ang gusto nating mangyari: Una, hindi tayo aangkat ng hindi kailangan, para lang punan ang bulsa ng mga gustong magsariling-diskarte ng kita sa agrikultura. Ikalawa: ayaw na nating umasa sa pag-angkat; ang isasaing ni Juan dela Cruz, dito ipupunla, dito aanihin, dito bibilhin. [Applause]
Balikan din po natin ang dinatnang kalagayan ng ating mga kawal at kapulisan. Labintatlong libong piso po ang karaniwang suweldo ng isang PO1 sa Metro Manila. Apat na libong piso daw rito ang napupunta sa upa ng bahay. Tila tama nga po na isang-katlo ng kanilang sahod diretso na sa upa. Isang-katlo pa nito, para naman sa pagkain. At ang natitirang isang-katlo, para sa kuryente, tubig, pamasahe, pampaaral sa anak, gamot sakaling may magkasakit, at iba pa. Maganda na nga po kung tumabla ang kita niya sa gastusin. Kapag naman kinapos, malamang sa 5-6 po sila lalapit. At kapag nagpatung-patong ang interes ng utang nila, makakatanggi kaya sila sa tuksong dumelihensya?
Kaya ang ipinangako nating solusyon pabahay nitong Pebrero, ngayong Hulyo ay tinutupad na. Nakapag-abot na po tayo ng 4,000 Certificate of Entitlement to Lot Allocation sa magigiting nating kawal at pulis. Bahagi pa lang po ito ng target nating kabuuang 21,800 bahay sa pagtatapos ng taong ito. Ang dating apat na libong ibinabayad para sa upa kada buwan, ngayon, dalawandaang piso na lang, para pa sa bahay na pagmamay-ari talaga nila. [Applause] Ang dating nalalagas na halaga na pambayad sa buwanang renta, maaari nang igugol para sa ibang gastusin.
Mayroon pa raw pong mahigit 1,000 bahay na natitira, kaya po sa mga pulis at sundalo nating ‘di pa nakakapagpasa ng kanilang mga papeles, last call na po para sa batch na ito. Pero huwag po kayong mag-alala, sa susunod na taon, lalawak pa ang ating pabahay, at hindi lang pulis at kawal sa Luzon ang makikinabang. Inihahanda na ng NHA [National Housing Authority] ang lupang patatayuan sa Visayas at Mindanao, para sa susunod na taon, makapagpapatayo [applause] na tayo ng mga bahay doon. Sa ating mga kawani ng Bureau of Jail Management and Penology at Bureau of Fire Protection, may good news pa rin po ako sa inyo: kasama na po kayo rito. [Applause]
Kung seguridad na rin lang po ang ating pag-uusapan, ‘di ba’t karugtong din nito ang ating pambansang dangal? Dati, hindi man lang natin makuhang pumalag tuwing may sisindak sa atin sa loob mismo ng ating bakuran. Malinaw ang pahiwatig natin ngayon sa buong mundo: Ang sa Pilipinas ay sa Pilipinas; [applause] kapag tumapak ka sa Recto Bank, para ka na ring tumapak sa Recto Avenue. [Applause]
Tama nga po kaya ang kuwento tungkol sa isang stand-off noong araw? Tinapatan daw ang mga marino natin ng kanyon. Ang ginawa nila noong gabi, pumutol ng puno ng niyog, pininturahan ito ng itim, saka itinutok sa kalaban. [Laughter] Tapos na po ang panahong iyan. Parating na ang mga capability upgrade at modernization ng mga kagamitan ng ating Sandatahang Lakas. Literal na pong naglalakbay sa karagatan papunta rito ang kauna-unahan nating Hamilton Class Cutter, [applause] isang mas modernong barko na magagamit natin para mabantayan ang ating mga baybayin. Maaari pa po tayong makakuha ng mga barkong tulad nito. Idadagdag iyan sa kukunin na nating mga helicopter (plural po iyon), patrol craft, at sandata na bultong bibilhin ng AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines], PNP [Philippine National Police], kasama na ang DOJ [Department of Justice] upang makakuha ng malaking diskuwento. Lahat po ito, makakamtan sa matinong pamamahala; mabibili sa tamang presyo, nang walang kailangang ipadulas kung kani-kanino.
Wala tayong balak mang-away, pero kailangan ding mabatid ng mundo na handa tayong ipagtanggol ang atin. [Applause] Pinag-aaralan na rin po natin ang pag-angat ng kaso sa West Philippine Sea [applause] sa International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, upang masigurong sa mga susunod na pagkakataon ay hinahon at pagtitimpi ang maghahari tuwing may alitan sa teritoryo.
Alam ko pong magbubunga ang pag-aarugang ipinapamalas natin sa mga lingkod-bayan na nakatutok sa ating seguridad. Mantakin po ninyo: sa unang anim na buwan ng 2010, umabot sa 1,010 kotse at motorsiklo ang nanakaw. Ikumpara po natin iyan sa 460 kotse at motorsiklong nanakaw mula Enero hanggang Hunyo ng taong ito. Ang laki po ng naibawas, ‘di po ba? Malas ko lang po siguro na ‘yung isa o dalawang kaso ng carnapping ang naihe-headline, at hindi ang pagbawas sa mga insidente nito o ang mas mataas na porsyento ng mga nanakaw na kotse na naibalik na sa kanilang mga may-ari.
Isa pa pong halimbawa ng pagbabagong tinatamasa natin: Mayo ng taong 2003 nang lagdaan ang Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act, pero dahil hindi sineryoso ng estado ang pagpapatupad nito, 29 na indibiduwal lamang ang nahatulan sa loob ng pitong taon. Nalagpasan na po natin iyan, dahil umabot na sa 31 human traffickers ang nahatulan sa ating administrasyon. Ito nga po siguro ang sinasabing “sea change” ni Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ng Amerika. Dahil dito, natanggal na tayo sa Tier 2 Watchlist ng Trafficking in Persons Report nila [Applause]. Kung hindi tayo natanggal sa watchlist na ito, siguradong napurnada pa ang mga grant na maaari nating makuha mula sa Millenium Challenge Corporation at iba pa.
Dumako po tayo sa trabaho. Dagdag-trabaho ang unang panata natin sa Pilipino. Ang 8 percent na unemployment rate noong Abril ng nakaraang taon, naibaba na sa 7.2 percent nitong Abril ng 2011. [Applause]  Tandaan po natin: moving target ang nasa hanay ng ating unemployed, dahil taun-taon ay may mga bagong graduate na naghahanap ng trabaho. Nito nga pong huling taon, nadagdag pa sa bilang nila ang libu-libong hawi boys, tagasabit ng banderitas, at iba pang mga Pilipinong kumuha ng pansamantalang kabuhayan mula sa eleksyon. Ang resulta po natin: 1.4 milyon trabahong nalikha nitong nakaraang taon, nagtatapos po ng Abril.
Dati, nakapako sa pangingibang-bansa ang ambisyon ng mga Pilipino. Ngayon, may pagpipilian na siyang trabaho, at hangga’t tinatapatan niya ng sipag at determinasyon ang kanyang pangangarap, tiyak na maaabot niya ito.
Malaki pa po ang puwedeng madagdag sa trabahong nalilikha sa ating bansa. Ayon pa lang po sa website nating Philjobnet, may 50,000 trabahong hindi napupunan, napupunuan, kada buwan dahil hindi tugma ang kailangan ng mga kumpanya sa kakayahan at kaalaman ng mga naghahanap ng trabaho. Hindi po natin hahayaang masayang ang pagkakataong ito; ngayon pa lang, nagtatagpo na ang kaisipan ng DOLE [Department of Labor and Employment], CHED [Commission on Higher Education], TESDA [Technical Education and Skills Development Authority], at DepEd upang tugunan ang isyu ng job mismatch. Susuriin ang mga curriculum para maituon sa mga industriyang naghahanap ng empleyado, at gagabayan ang mga estudyante sa pagpili ng mga kursong hitik sa bakanteng trabaho.
Ngunit aanhin naman po natin ang mga numerong naghuhudyat ng pag-asenso ng iilan, kung marami pa rin ang napag-iiwanan? Ang unang hakbang: tinukoy natin ang totoong nangangailangan; namuhunan tayo sa pinakamahalaga nating yaman: ang taumbayan. Sa 2 milyong pamilyang rehistrado sa ating Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, 1.6 milyon na ang nakakatanggap ng benepisyo nito. Sa pagpapakitang-gilas ni Secretary Dinky Soliman, tinatayang may mahigit 100,000 pamilya [applause]—uulitin ko po: mahigit 100,000 pamilya ang naiaahon natin mula sa kahirapan kada buwan. Kaya naman mataas ang aking kumpiyansang makukumpleto ang 1.3 million na dagdag na pamilya, mula sa kabuuang 2.3 milyong target na benepisyaryo ng CCT bago matapos ang taong ito. At sa compliance rate nito na hindi bababa sa 92 percent, milyun-milyon na rin po ang inang regular na nagpapa-checkup sa mga health center, ang mga sanggol na napabakunahan, at ang mga batang hindi hinahayaan sa labas ng paaralan. [Applause]
Simula pa lang po ito, at sa ganitong kalinaw na mga resulta, umaasa ako sa suporta ng bawat Pilipino, lalo na po ng lehislatura, sa mungkahi nating salinan pa ng pondo ang Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. Inaasam po natin na bago matapos ang 2012, 3 milyong pamilya na ang mabibigyan ng puhunan para sa kanilang kinabukasan.
Binibigyan natin ang mga maralitang pamilyang ito ng pagkakataong makaahon sa buhay, dahil ang pag-asenso nila ay pag-angat rin ng buong bansa. Sino ang tatangkilik sa mga produkto at serbisyo ng mga negosyante, kung isang kahig, isang tuka naman ang mamimili? Kapag may amang kumakapit sa patalim para may kainin ang kanyang pamilya, at siya ay magnakaw o nangholdap, sino ba ang puwedeng mabiktima ng krimen kundi tayo rin? Kung ang mga kababayan natin ay walang maayos na pagkain o tahanan, mahina ang kalusugan at may malubhang karamdaman, hindi ba’t tayo rin ang nasa peligrong mahawa sa kanilang sakit?
Naglalatag po tayo ng pagbabago upang mapatibay ang pundasyon ng maaliwalas na bukas para sa lahat. Halimbawa po, sa kalusugan: di ba’t kapansin-pansin ang pagtaas ng bilang ng mga benepisyaryo ng PhilHealth tuwing maghahalalan? Ngayon, sa pamamagitan ng National Household Targeting System for Poverty Reduction (NHTS-PR), tiniyak natin na ang 5.2 milyon pamilyang Pilipino na nakikinabang sa PhilHealth ay ang talagang mga nangangailangan nito. Malawakang pag-unlad at pag-asenso ng lahat: Iyan po ang panata natin. Walang maiiwan sa tuwid na landas. [Applause]
Tumungo naman po tayo sa ARMM [Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]. Ang dating sistema: Nagbabatuhan lang ng huwad na utang ng loob ang mga baluktot na kandidato. Kapag pambansang halalan, malaya ang nakaupo sa ARMM na imane-obra ang makinarya sa kaniyang rehiyon para matiyak na bokya, o sero, ang boto ng hindi kaalyado. Kapag naman eleksyon sa ARMM at maniningil na ng utang si Mayor o Governor, ang administrasyon naman ang magpapatakbo ng makinarya para manalo ang kanilang kandidato.
Ayon nga po sa naungkat ng COA [Commission on Audit], sa opisina ng regional governor ng ARMM, mula Enero 2008 hanggang Setyembre 2009, walumpung—uulitin ko po: 80 porsyento ng mga disbursement ang napunta sa mga cash advance na wala namang maayos na paliwanag. Kung hindi nawala ang pondong ito, nakatapos na sana ang isang batang sa ngayon tumatawid sa ghost bridge, para pumasok sa ghost school, kung saan tuturuan siya ng ghost teacher. [Applause] Kaawa-awang bata: walang humpay na paghihirap, at walang pag-asa ng pag-asenso.
Gusto nating maranasan ng ARMM ang benepisyo ng tamang pamamahala. Kaya ang atin pong minungkahing solusyon: synchronization. Dahil dito, kailangan nilang tumutok sa kani-kanilang mga kampanya; magiging mas patas ang labanan, at lalabnaw ang command votes. Salamat po sa Kongreso at naipasa na ang batas na magsasabay sa halalan ng ARMM sa halalang pambansa. [Applause]
May nagtatanong po, bakit postponement ang kailangan? Sa kagustuhang, siyempre, makabalik sa puwesto, nakahanda ang ilan na ulitin ang nakagawian para manalo. Isipin na lang po ninyo kung pumayag tayo sa kagustuhan ng mga kontra, at itinuloy natin ang eleksyon. Wala po silang ibang gagawin sa loob ng dalawang taon kundi paghandaan ang susunod na halalan at isiksik ang kalokohan nila sa mas maigsing panahon. Habang nananatili sa puwesto ang mga utak wangwang na opisyal, naiiwan namang nakalubog sa kumunoy ng kawalang-pagasa ang taumbayan.
Wala akong duda sa kahihinatnan ng mga repormang inilatag na natin. Hindi po tayo nagbubukambibig lang; may kongkretong resulta ang ating mga paninindigan. Kapag sinabi nating tuwid na daan, may katapat itong kalsada sa Barangay Bagumbayan sa Sta. Maria, Laguna. ‘Pag sinabi nating malinis na pamamahala, may dadaloy na malinis na tubig sa mga liblib na lugar gaya ng nasa Barangay Poblacion, sa Ferrol, Romblon. Kapag sinabi nating liwanag ng pagbabago, titiyakin nating may liwanag na tatanglaw sa mga pamayanang dati ay nangangapa sa aandap-andap na gasera, gaya ng ginawa natin sa Barangay San Marcos, sa Bunawan, Agusan del Sur. Ganito na ang nangyayari sa marami pang ibang lugar; pinipilit nating ito rin ang mangyari sa kabuuan ng Pilipinas.
Nakatutok na po ang iba’t ibang ahensya ng gobyerno; nag-uugnayan at nagtutulungan sila upang maabot at mapabilis ang mga solusyon sa mga problemang kaytagal nang pinapasan ng bayan.
Di po ba’t may problema tayo sa baha, na alam naman nating dulot ng walang humpay at ilegal na pagputol ng mga puno? Ang dating solusyon: photo-op ng pagtatanim na ang tanging benepisyaryo ay nagpapoging pulitiko. Nagtanim nga ng puno kontra-baha, pero hindi naman siniguro na mananatiling nakatayo ang mga ito pag-alis nila.
Isa sa mga solusyong hinahanda na po at pinag-aaralan ay ang gawing kapaki-pakinabang sa mga pamayanan ang pagbabantay ng puno. Bibigyan sila ng binhi ng kape at cacao para itanim at mamunga ng kabuhayan. Habang hinihintay ang ani, makakakuha sila ng stipend upang bantayan naman ang mga punong itinanim laban sa baha. Puwedeng maging benepisyaryo ng programang ito ang mga informal settlers, na ngayon ay nagkukumpulan sa siyudad. Mamumuhunan tayo sa taumbayan, habang namumuhunan din sa kalikasan.
Noon bang isang taon, inisip kaya natin na kaya nating gawin ito? Sa ngayon, tinutupad na natin ang ating mga pangako. Bukas makalawa, katotohanan na ang lahat ng ating mga pinangarap. [Applause]
Marami pa pong malikhaing konsepto na inilalapit sa atin, at ang atin pong ipinatupad na. May mosquito trap na pinapatay ang mga kiti-kiti ng lamok, na siguro naman po ay may kinalaman sa halos 14 porsiyentong pagbaba ng insidente ng dengue; may hibla ng niyog na itatapon na sana, pero puwede palang murang solusyon sa mga daanang madaling mabitak; may landslide sensor na magbababala kung tumaas na ang panganib na gumuho ang lupa; may mga kagamitang magbibigay ng senyales kung malapit nang umapaw ang tubig sa mga ilog. Lahat po nito, gawa ng Pilipino.
Pinag-aaralan na rin po ng DOST [Department of Science and Technology] at UP [University of the Philippines] ang pagkakaroon natin ng monorail system, [applause] para tugunan ang problema sa pangmalawakang transportasyon. Sa malikhaing pag-iisip ng kapwa Pilipino, may pag-asa pala tayong magtayo ng light rail system nang hindi hihigit sa 100 million pesos ang gagastusin kada kilometro. Sa matitipid na pondo, mas mahabang kilometro ng riles ang mailalatag at makaka-abot sa mga lugar na malayo sa sentro ng komersyo. Ang mga dating sumisiksik sa siyudad para maghanap ng trabaho, maaari nang tumira sa medyo mas malayo, nang hindi pahirapan ang biyahe.
Uulitin ko po: ang mungkahing ito ay galing sa kapwa natin Pilipino, para sa Pilipinas. Naaalala po ba ninyo ang panahon kung kailan ni hindi man lang maabot ng mga pangarap natin ang ganitong mga proyekto? Ngayon, sinasabi ko po sa inyo: pinapangarap natin ito, kaya natin ito, gagawin natin ito. Hindi ba tayo nagagalak, Pilipino tayong nabubuhay sa mga panahong ito? [Applause]
Sa kabila ng lahat ng ito, huwag po sana nating lilimutin: masasayang lang ang lahat ng ating narating kung hindi tuluyang maiwawaksi ang kultura ng korupsyon na dinatnan natin.
Sa mga kapwa ko empleyado ng sambayanan, mula sa tuktok hanggang sa bawat sulok ng burukrasya: Di po ba’t napakarangal na ngayon ang magtrabaho sa gobyerno? Di po ba’t ngayon, sa halip na ikahiya, gusto mo pang isuot kung minsan ang iyong ID kung sumasakay ka ng bus o jeep papasok sa iyong ahensya? Sasayangin po ba natin ang karangalang kaloob sa atin ng sambayanan?
Iyan din po ang aking panawagan sa ating local government units (LGUs). Kabilang po ako sa mga sumasang-ayon na kayo ang pinaka-nakakaalam sa pangangailangan ng taumbayan sa inyong mga lungsod at munisipyo. Makakaasa po ang ating mga LGU sa higit na kalayaan at kakayahan, kung makakaasa rin tayong gagamitin ito sa tuwid na paraan, at isasaalang-alang ang kapakanan ng buong sambayanan.
Halimbawa po, may ilang munisipyo na naisipang magbuwis sa mga transmission lines ng kuryente na dadaan sa kanilang mga pook. Magpapasok nga po ng kita sa kanilang lokal na kaban, pero kapalit nito, tataas din ang gastusin ng mas nakararaming Pilipino sa kuryente. Tiwala po akong kaya nating balansehin ang interes ng inyong mga nasasakupan sa interes ng sambayanan.
Kailangan pong manatiling magkatugma ang ating mga programa, dahil ang ikauunlad ng buong bansa ay manganganak din ng resulta sa inyong mga pook. Wakasan na po sana natin ang agendang nakatuon sa susunod na eleksyon lamang, at ang kaisipang isla-isla tayong maihihiwalay ang sariling pagsulong sa pag-unlad ng bansa.
Tayu-tayo rin po ang dapat magtulungan tungo sa kaunlaran. Malaki ang pasasalamat ko sa Kongreso sa pagpapasa ng mga batas ukol sa GOCC Governance, ARMM Synchronization, [applause] Lifeline Electricity Rates Extension, Joint Congressional Power Commission Extension, Children and Infants’ Mandatory Immunization, at Women Night Workers, at marami pa sigurong pasunod.
Noong isang taon nga po, nagpakitang-gilas ang Kongreso sa pagpasa ng budget bago matapos ang taon. Dahil dito, nasimulan agad ang mga proyekto at hindi na inabot ng tag-ulan. Bukas na bukas po, ihahain na namin sa lehislatura ang budget para sa susunod na taon. [Applause] Umaasa po ako na muli kayong magpapakitang-gilas, upang tuluyan na nating mapitas ang bunga ng mga naitanim nating pagbabago.
Maganda na po ang ating nasimulan. Pero mahalaga pong maalala natin: simula pa lang ito. Marami pa tayong gagawin. Hayaan po ninyong ilatag ko sa Kongreso ang ilan sa mga batas na magpapaigting sa pagtupad ng ating mga panata sa bayan.
Layon nating bigyan ng kaukulang kompensasyon ang mga biktima ng Martial Law; [applause] ang pagkakaloob ng makatarungang pasahod at benepisyo para sa mga kasambahay; at ang pagpapatupad ng isang mas maayos na sistema ng pensyon para sa atin pong mga kawal. Sinusuportahan din natin ang pagpapalawak ng sakop ng scholarship na ipinagkakaloob ng DOST sa mahuhusay ngunit kapuspalad na mag-aaral; ang pagtataguyod ng pinaigting na pangkalahatang kalusugan; at ang pangangalaga sa ating kalikasan at sa mga pasilidad na titiyak sa kaligtasan ng mga mamamayan sa oras ng sakuna.
Kabilang din po sa ating agenda ang pagpapalakas ng Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), ng National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), ng National Electrification Administration (NEA), at pati na rin po ng PTV 4, upang sa halip na mapag-iwanan ng kaalaman at panahon, mas maayos nilang magagampanan ang kanilang pagbibigay-serbisyo sa publiko.
Hindi ko po nailagay ang lahat ng gustong magpasali ng kanilang adbokasiya dito po sa SONA. Pero kumpleto po ang detalye sa budget at budget message. Sa mga interesado po, pakibasa na lang detalye doon.
May mga nagsasabing pinepersonal ko raw ang paghahabol sa mga tiwali. Totoo po: Personal talaga sa akin ang paggawa ng tama, [applause] at ang pagpapanagot sa mga gumagawa ng mali—sino man sila. At hindi lamang dapat ako ang namemersonal sa usaping ito. Personal dapat ito sa ating lahat, dahil bawat Pilipino ay biktima nito. [Applause]
Ang mali—gaano katagal man ito nanatili—ay mali pa rin. Hindi puwedeng “Oks lang”; hindi puwedeng “wala lang iyan.” Kapag kinalimutan natin ang mga ito, mangyayari lang ulit ang mga kamalian ng nakaraan. Kung hindi magbabayad ang mga nagkasala, parang tayo na rin mismo ang nag-imbita sa mga nagbabalak gumawa ng masama na kung puwede, uulitin ninyo ang ginawa ninyo. [Applause]
Ang totoo nga po, marami pang kalokohan ang nahalungkat natin—pero hindi na po magpapakahaba doon, bigyan ko na lang kayo ng isang halimbawa. Sa PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]: kape. Isang bilyong piso po ang ginastos ng dating pamunuan ng ahensya para sa kape; sa 100 piso na lang po kada tasa, lalabas na nakakonsumo sila ng 10 milyong tasa ng kape. [Laughter] Baka po kahit ngayong iba na ang pamunuan ng PAGCOR ay dilat na dilat pa rin ang mata ng mga uminom ng kapeng ito. [Laughter] Hanapin nga po natin sila, at matanong: nakakatulog pa po kayo? [Laughter]
Pagpasok ng bagong Ombudsman na si dating Supreme Court Justice Conchita Carpio-Morales, [applause] magkakaroon tayo ng tanod-bayan na hindi magiging tanod-bayad ng mga nagwawangwang sa pamahalaan. Inaasahan ko nga po na sa taon na ito, masasampahan na ng kaso ang maraming nagkuntsabahan sa katiwalian, at naging sanhi ng situwasyong ating inabutan. Tapos na rin po ang panahon kung kailan nagsasampa ang gobyerno ng malalabnaw na kaso. Kapag tayo ang nagsampa, matibay ang ebidensya, malinaw ang testimonya, at siguradong walang lusot ang salarin. [Applause]
Tutok po tayo na ang pagkakamit ng ganap na katarungan ay hindi natatapos sa pagsasakdal kung hindi sa pagkukulong ng maysala. Buo ang kumpiyansa ko na tinutupad ng Department of Justice ang malaki nilang bahagi upang maipiit ang mga salarin, lalo na sa mga kaso ukol sa tax evasion, drug trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling, graft and corruption, at extrajudicial killings. [Applause]
Wala pong tsamba: ang tapat at mabuting pamamahala ay nanganganak ng mabuti ring resulta. Isipin po ninyo: naipatupad natin ang mga ipinangakong serbisyo ng gobyerno, at nakapaglaan pa ng sapat na pondo para sa mga proyekto nang hindi kinailangang magtaas ng buwis.
Iyan naman po talaga ang plano: siguruhin na patas ang laban; itigil ang panlalamang ng mga makapangyarihan; at tiyakin na ang dating sistema kung saan nakikinabang ang iilan ay magiging bukal ng oportunidad para sa lahat.
Tinutuldukan na po natin ang wangwang: sa kalsada, sa gobyerno, sa kalakhang lipunan. Ito po ang manganganak ng kumpiyansa na magdadala ng negosyo; ito rin ang sisiguro na ang pondo ng taumbayan ay mapupunta sa dapat nitong kalagyan: Imprastruktura na titiyak sa tuluyang pag-angat ng ekonomiya at pagmumulan ng trabaho, at serbisyong panlipunan na sisigurong walang mapapag-iiwanan. Bubukas ang marami pang pintuang pangkabuhayan sa pamamagitan ng turismo; sisiguruhing hindi magugutom ang Pilipino sa pagpapalakas ng agrikultura. Ang mga dating kinakaligtaan, bibigyang-puhunan ang kinabukasan.
Magbubunsod ito ng siklo kung saan tiyak na may pupuno sa mga nalilikhang trabaho, at may mga konsumer na lalong magpapalago sa mga negosyo.
Batid ko po na hanggang ngayon ay may kakaunti pang nagrereklamo sa ating istilo ng pamamahala. Nakita po ninyo ang aming istilo, at ang kaakibat nitong resulta. Nakita po ninyo ang istilo nila, at kung saan tayo nito dinala. Sa mga taong bukas ang mata, maliwanag kung saan ang tama.
Ngayong tayo na ang nagtitimon sa gobyerno, malinaw ang direksyong tinatahak ng ating bayan. Isang bansa kung saan ang pagkakataon ay abot-kamay; kung saan ang mga nangangailangan ay sinasaklolohan; kung saan may saysay ang bawat patak ng pawis, bawat sandali ng pagtitiis, at bawat butil ng hinagpis na dinaanan natin. Kung may gawin kang mabuti, may babalik sa iyong mabuti. At kung may gawin kang masama, tiyak na mananagot ka. [Applause]
Naaalala ko nga po ang isang ginang na lumapit sa akin noong kampanya; ang babala niya, “Noy, mag-iingat ka, marami kang kinakabangga.”
Tama po ang sabi niya: Tama pong may agam-agam din ako kung minsan. Pero wala po akong alinlangang tumahak sa tuwid na daan: Buo ang loob ko dahil alam kong nasa likod ko po kayo. Salamat po. [Applause]
Salamat po sa mga pari at obispo na masinsinang nakipagdiyalogo sa atin, katulad nina Cardinal Rosales at Vidal. Di naman po kami ganoong kalapit ni Cardinal Rosales, pero naniniwala akong ibinuhos niya ang lahat para mabawasan ang hindi pinagkakaunawaan ng gobyerno at simbahan. Sa pagkahalal kay Archbishop Palma, tagapagtanggol ng karapatang pantao at kalikasan, lalo pong tumibay ang aking kumpiyansang ugnayan, at hindi bangayan, ang mabubuo sa pagitan ng estado at simbahan. [Applause]
Salamat din po sa ating Gabinete, na walang kinikilalang panahon ng tulog o pahinga, maipatupad lang ang pambansang agenda. Special mention po ang PAGASA [Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration], na tunay na ngayong nagbibigay ng maaasahang babala. [Applause]
At sa mga nasasagasaan po natin sa landas ng katapatan at integridad sa pamamahala, ito naman po ang aking masasabi: Pinili ninyo ang landas kung saan naaapi ang sambayanan. Pinili naman namin ang landas na ipagtanggol ang taumbayan. [Applause] Nasa tama po kami; nasa mali kayo. Sa inyong magbabalik ng pang-aapi sa sambayan, hindi kayo magtatagumpay. [Applause]
Sa lahat ng mga kasama natin sa tuwid na daan: kayo ang lumikha ng pagkakataong baguhin ang dinatnan, at gawing mas maganda ang ipapamana natin sa susunod na salinlahi ng mga Pilipino. Kayo pong mga tsuper na pumapasada pa rin; kayong mga guro at estudyanteng pauwi pa lang mula sa klase; kayong patuloy ang paglikha ng mga obrang nagpapaalab sa apoy ng ating pagka-Pilipino; kayong mga pulis, sundalo, kaminero, at bumbero; kayong mga marangal na magtrabaho, sa Pilipinas man, sa gitnang dagat, o sa ibang bansa; kayong mga tapat na kasama natin sa gobyerno, anumang probinsya o partido; kayong mga Pilipinong nakikinig sa akin ngayon—kayo po ang lumikha ng pagkakataong ito.
Lumikha po kayo ng gobyernong tunay na nagtatrabaho para sa inyo. May limang taon pa tayo para siguruhing hindi na tayo babalik sa dating kalagayan. Hindi tayo magpapadiskaril ngayong napakaganda na ng resulta ng ating sinimulan.
Kapag may nakita tayong butas sa sistema, huwag na po tayo magtangkang lumusot. Huwag na nating daanin sa pakiusap ang madadaan sa pagsisikap. Tama na ang unahan, tama na ang tulakan, tama na ang lamangan, dahil lahat naman po tayo ay makakarating sa minimithi nating kinabukasan.
Tapusin na po natin ang kultura ng negatibismo; iangat natin ang kapwa-Pilipino sa bawat pagkakataon. Bakit po ang iba, ang hilig maghanap ng kung anu-anong pangit sa ating bayan? At napakahirap—parang kasalanan—na magsabi ng maganda? Naalala pa po ba natin noong huling beses tayong pumuri sa kapwa Pilipino?
Itigil na po natin ang paghihilahan pababa. Ang dating industriya ng pintasan na hindi natin maitakwil, iwaksi na po natin. Tuldukan na po natin ang pagiging utak-alimango; puwede bang iangat naman natin ang magaganda nating nagawa?
Kung may nakita kang mabuti, huwag kang magdalawang-isip na purihin ito. Kapag nakita mo ang pulis sa kanto, nagtatrapik nang walang kapote sa ilalim ng ulan, lapitan mo naman sana at sabihing, “Salamat po.”
Kung magkasakit ka at makita mo ang nars na nag-aruga sa iyo, sa halip na magserbisyo sa dayuhan kapalit ng mas malaking suweldo, pakisabi rin po, “Salamat po.” [Applause]
Bago ka umuwi galing eskuwela, lapitan mo ang guro mong piniling mamuhunan sa iyong kinabukasan kaysa unahin ang sariling ginhawa; sabihin mo, “Salamat po”: Tulad ng aking gurong nasa screen ngayon, Salamat po Ginang Escasa. [Applause]
Kung makasalubong mo ang iyong kinatawan sa kalsadang dati ay lubak-lubak (o wala), at ngayon ay puwede nang daanan nang maaliwalas, lapitan mo siya at sabihing: “Salamat po.”
Kaya po, sa sambayanang Pilipino, ang aking Boss na nagtimon sa atin tungo sa araw na ito: maraming, maraming salamat po sa pagbabagong tinatamasa natin ngayon.
Buhay na buhay na ang Pilipinas at ang Pilipino.

State of the Nation Address of His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III President of the Philippines To the Congress of the Philippines
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 23, 2012]
Maraming salamat po. Maupo ho tayong lahat.
Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte; Bise Presidente Jejomar Binay; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; ang ating mga kagalang-galang na mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga kagalang-galang na miyembro ng Kamara de Representante at ng Senado; mga pinuno ng pamahalaang lokal; mga miyembro ng ating Gabinete; mga unipormadong kasapi ng militar at kapulisan; mga kapwa kong nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at, siyempre, sa akin pong mga boss, magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat.
Ito po ang aking ikatlong SONA, at parang kailan lang nang nagsimula tayong mangarap. Parang kailan lang nang sabay-sabay tayong nagpasyang tahakin ang tuwid na daan. Parang kailan lang nang sinimulan nating iwaksi ang wang-wang, hindi lamang sa kalsada kundi sa sistemang panlipunan.
Dalawang taon na ang nakalipas mula nang sinabi ninyo, “Sawa na kami sa korupsyon; sawa na kami sa kahirapan.” Oras na upang ibalik ang isang pamahalaang tunay na kakampi ng taumbayan.
Gaya ng marami sa inyo, namulat ako sa panggigipit ng makapangyarihan. Labindalawang-taong gulang po ako nang idineklara ang Batas Militar. Bumaliktad ang aming mundo: Pitong taon at pitong buwang ipiniit ang aking ama; tatlong taong napilitang mangibang-bansa ang aking pamilya; naging saksi ako sa pagdurusa ng marami dahil sa diktadurya. Dito napanday ang aking prinsipyo: Kung may inaagrabyado’t ninanakawan ng karapatan, siya ang kakampihan ko. Kung may abusadong mapang-api, siya ang lalabanan ko. Kung may makita akong mali sa sistema, tungkulin kong itama ito. [Applause]
Matagal nang tapos ang Batas Militar. Tinanong tayo noon, “Kung hindi tayo, sino pa?” at “Kung hindi ngayon, kailan pa?” Ang nagkakaisang tugon natin: tayo at ngayon na. Ang demokrasyang ninakaw gamit ang paniniil at karahasan, nabawi natin sa mapayapang paraan; matagumpay nating pinag-alab ang liwanag mula sa pinakamadilim na kabanata ng ating kasaysayan.
Ngunit huwag po nating kalimutan ang pinag-ugatan ng Batas Militar: Kinasangkapan ng diktador ang Saligang Batas upang manatili sa kapangyarihan. At hanggang ngayon, tuloy pa rin ang banggaan sa pagitan ng gusto ng sistemang parehas, laban sa mga nagnanais magpatuloy ng panlalamang.
Mula sa unang araw ng ating panunungkulan, walang ibang sumalubong sa atin kundi ang mga bangungot ng nawalang dekada.
Nariyan po ang kaso ng North Rail. Pagkamahal-mahal na nga nito, matapos ulitin ang negosasyon, nagmahal pa lalo. Sa kabila nito, binawasan ang benepisyo. Ang labingsiyam na train sets naging tatlo, at sa mga estasyon, mula lima, naging dalawa. Ang masaklap pa po, pinapabayaran na sa atin ang utang nito, now na.
Nariyan ang walang pakundangang bonus sa ilang GOCC [government-owned and -controlled corporation], sa kabila ng pagkalugi ng kanilang mga ahensya. Nariyan ang 1 bilyong pisong pinasingaw ng PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation]  para sa kape. Nariyan ang sistemang pamamahala sa PNP [Philippine National Police] na isinantabi ang pangangailangan sa armas ng 45 porsiyento ng kapulisan, para lang kumita mula sa lumang helicopter na binili sa presyong brand new.
Wala na ngang iniwang panggastos, patung-patong at sabay-sabay pa ang mga utang na kailangang bayaran na. Mahaba ang iniwang listahan na tungkulin nating punuan: Ang 66,800 na backlog sa classrooms, na nagkakahalaga ng tinatayang 53.44 billion pesos; ang 2,573,212 na backlog sa mga upuan, na nagkakahalaga naman ng 2.31 billion pesos. Nang dumating tayo, may halos 36 na milyong Pilipinong hindi pa miyembro ng PhilHealth. Ang kailangan para makasali sila: maaaring umabot sa 42 billion pesos. Idagdag pa po natin sa lahat ng iyan ang 103 billion pesos na kailangan para sa modernisasyon ng Hukbong Sandatahan. Sa harap ng lahat ng ito, ang iniwan sa ating pondo na malaya nating magagamit: 6.5 percent ng kabuuang budget para sa natitirang anim na buwan ng 2010. Para po tayong boksingerong isinabak sa laban nang nakagapos na nga ang mga kamay at paa, nakapiring pa ang mga mata, at kakampi pa ng kalaban ang referee at ang mga judge.
Kaya nga sa unang tatlong buwan ng aming panunungkulan, inaabangan namin ang pagdating ng Linggo para maidulog sa Panginoon ang mga bangungot na humaharap sa amin. Inasahan naming mangangailangan ng di bababa sa dalawang taon bago magkaroon ng makabuluhang pagbabago. Bibigyan kaya tayo ng sapat na pag-unawa ng taumbayan?
Subalit kung may isang bagay mang nakatatak na sa ating lahi, at makailang ulit na nating pinatunayan sa buong mundo: Walang hindi makakaya ang nagkakaisang Pilipino. Nangarap po tayo ng pagbabago; nakamit natin ang pagbabago; at ngayon, karaniwan na ito. [Applause]
Ang kalsadang pinondohan ninyo ay tuwid, patag, at walang bukol; ang tanging tongpats ay aspalto o semento. Karaniwan na po ito.
Ang sitwasyon kung paparating ang bagyo: nakaabang na ang relief, at hindi ang tao ang nag-aabang ng relief. Nag-aabang na ring umalalay ang rescue services sa taumbayan, at hindi tayu-tayo lang din ang sumasaklolo sa isa’t isa. Karaniwan na  po ito.
Ang wang-wang sa lansangan, galing na lang sa pulis, ambulansya, o bumbero—hindi sa opisyal ng gobyerno. Karaniwan na rin po ito. Ang gobyernong dating nang-aabuso, ngayon, tunay na kakampi na ng Pilipino. [Applause]
Nagpatupad po tayo ng reporma: tinanggal ang gastusing hindi kailangan, hinabol ang mga tiwali, at ipinakita sa mundong open for business under new management na ang Pilipinas.
Ang dating sick man of Asia, ngayon, punung-puno na ng sigla. Nang nagkaroon tayo ng positive credit rating action, ang sabi ng iba, tsamba. Ngayong walo na po sila, tsamba pa rin kaya? [Applause] Sa Philippine Stock Exchange index, nang una nating nahigitan ang 4,000 na index, may mga nagduda. Ngayon, sa dami ng all-time high, pati economic managers, nahirapan yata sa pagbilang, at ako rin po ay nagulat: nakaka-44 na pala tayo, at bihira nang bumaba sa 5,000 ang index. [Applause] Nito pong first quarter ng 2012, ang GDP growth natin, 6.4 percent; milya-milya ang layo niyan sa mga prediksyon, at pinakamataas sa buong Southeast Asian region; pangalawa po ito sa Asya, sunod lang tayo sa Tsina. [Applause] Kung dati po, tayo ang laging nangungutang, ngayon, hindi po birong tayo na ang nagpapautang. [Applause] Dati po’y namamalimos tayo ng investments; ngayon, sila na ang dumadagsa. Ang mga kumpanyang Hapon, sa isang pagpupulong po namin, ang sabi ay, “Baka gusto n’yo kaming silipin. Hindi nga kami ang pinakamura, pero una naman kami sa teknolohiya.” Pati pinuno ng isa pong malaking bangko sa Inglatera, kamakailan nakipag-usap sa atin, at ang sinabi, maisali sana sila sa ating kinukonsulta sa usapang pinansyal.
Sa bawat sulok ng mundo, nagpapakita ng paghanga ang mga komentarista. Ayon sa Bloomberg Businessweek, and I quote: “Keep an eye on the Philippines.” Ang Foreign Policy magazine, pati isa sa mga pinuno ng ASEAN 100, nagsabing maaari daw tayong maging, and I quote, “Asia’s Next Tiger.” [Applause] Sabi ni Ruchir Sharma, pinuno ng Emerging Market Equities and Global Macro ng Morgan Stanley, I quote: “The Philippines is no longer a joke.” At mukha naman pong hindi siya nambobola, dahil tinatayang 1 bilyong dolyar ang ipinasok ng kanyang kumpanya sa atin pong bansa. [Applause] Sana nga po, ang kaliwa’t kanang paghanga ng taga-ibang bansa, masundan na rin ng lokal na tagapagbalita. [Applause]
Sinisiguro po nating umaabot ang kaunlaran sa mas nakakarami. Alalahanin po natin: Nang mag-umpisa tayo, may 760,357 na kabahayang benepisyaryo ang Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program. Tinarget [target] natin itong paabutin sa 3.1 million sa loob ng dalawang taon. Pebrero pa lang po ng taong ito, naiparehistro na ang ika-3 milyong kabahayang benepisyaryo ng Pantawid Pamilya. [Applause] Sa susunod na taon naman, palalawakin pa natin ang sakop nito sa 3.8 milyong bahay; limang beses po ang laki niyan sa dinatnan natin.
Pangmatagalan po ang impact ng proyektong ito. Hindi pa kumpleto ang mga pag-aaral, pero ngayon pa lang, maganda na ang ipinapakita ng numero. Base sa listahan ng DSWD [Department of Social Welfare and Development]: may 1,672,977 na mga inang regular nang nagpapa-checkup. Idagdag pa natin, 1,672,814 na mga batang napabakunahan laban sa diarrhea, polio, tigdas, at iba pa; 4.57 million na estudyanteng hindi na napipilitang mag-absent dahil sa kahirapan. [Applause]
Sa kalusugan naman po: Nang dumating tayo, 62 porsiyento lamang ng mga Pilipino ang naka-enrol sa PhilHealth. Ang masaklap, hindi pa masiguro kung lahat sila ay kabilang sa mga totoong nangangailangan ng kalinga ng estado, o buwenas lang na malapit sa politiko. Ngayon po, 85 percent ng lahat ng mamamayan, miyembro na nito. [Applause] Ang ibig pong sabihin, 23.31 million na Pilipino ang naidagdag sa mga saklaw ng PhilHealth mula nang bigyan tayo ng mandato. [Applause]
Ang maganda pa rito: Ang 5.2 million na pinakamahirap na kabahayang tinukoy ng National Household Targeting System, buong-buo at walang-bayad nang makikinabang sa benepisyo ng PhilHealth. [Applause] Dahil po sa No Balance Billing policy ng Department of Health, ang lunas para sa dengue, pneumonia, asthma, katarata, gayundin ang pagpapagamot sa mga catastrophic disease tulad ng breast cancer, prostate cancer, at acute leukemia, makukuha na nang libre ng mga pinakamahirap nating kababayan. [Applause]
Ito po ang proseso ng pagpapagamot para sa kanila: Papasok ka sa alinmang ospital ng gobyerno. Ipapakita mo ang iyong PhilHealth card. Magpapagamot ka. At uuwi kang maginhawa nang walang inilabas ni isang kusing.
Sabi nga po sa isa sa mga briefing na dinaluhan natin, 4 sa 10 Pilipino, hindi man lamang nakakakita ng health professional sa tanang buhay nila. Sa iba po, mas malaki pa: May nagsasabing 6 sa bawat 10 Pilipino ang pumapanaw nang malayo sa kalinga ng health professional. Anuman ang ating pagbatayan, hindi po maikakaila: Nakakabahala ang bilang ng mga Pilipinong hindi naaabot ang serbisyong pangkalusugan ng pamahalaan. Tinutugunan na po natin ito. Mula sa 10,000 noong dumating tayo, umabot na sa 30,801 ang mga nurse at midwife na ating nai-deploy sa ilalim ng RNHeals Program. [Applause] Idagdag pa po natin sa kanila ang mahigit 11,000 Community Health Teams na nagsisilbing tulay upang higit na mapatibay ang ugnayan ng mga doktor at nurse sa komunidad.
At kung dati tutungo lamang ang mga nurse kung saan makursunadahan ng kanilang hepe, ngayon, dahil sa tamang targeting, kung saan sila kailangan, doon sila ipinapadala: [applause] sa mga lugar na matagal nang naiwan sa laylayan ng lipunan. Ipinadala po natin ang ating mga health professional sa 1,021 na pook na saklaw ng Pantawid Pamilya, at sa 609 na pinakamahihirap na lungsod at munisipyo, ayon sa pag-aaral ng National Anti-Poverty Commission. [Applause]
Dalawang problema po ang natutugunan nito: Bukod sa nagkakatrabaho at nabibigyan ng work experience ang libu-libong nurse at midwife na dati ay walang mapaglalaanan ng kanilang kaalaman, nagiging abot-kamay din ang dekalidad na kalinga para sa milyun-milyon nating kababayan.
Subalit hindi pa po tayo makukuntento rito, dahil ang hangad natin: kalusugang pangkalahatan. Nagsisimula ito hindi sa mga pagamutan, kundi sa loob mismo ng kanya-kanya nating tahanan. Ibayong kaalaman, bakuna, at checkup ang kailangan upang mailayo tayo sa karamdaman. Dagdag pa po diyan ang pagsisikap nating iwasan ang mga sakit na puwede namang iwasan.
Halimbawa: Nabanggit ko ang mosquito traps kontra dengue noong nakaraang taon. Alam naman po ninyo, ang mga siyentipiko mahigpit sa pagsisiyasat. Kaya maaga pa para sabihing siguradong-sigurado na tayo, pero nakakaengganyo po ang mga paunang resulta nitong programang ito.
Sinubok natin ang bisa ng mosquito traps sa mga lugar kung saan naitala ang pinakamataas na insidente ng dengue. Sa buong probinsya ng Bukidnon noong 2010, may 1,216 na kaso. Nang inilagay ang mga mosquito trap noong 2011: mukhang nakatulong dahil bumaba ito sa 37; 97 percent daw po ang reduction nito. [Applause] Sa mga bayan ng Ballesteros at Claveria sa Cagayan, may 228 na kaso ng dengue noong 2010. Pagdating ng 2011, walo na lang ang naitala. Sa Catarman, Northern Samar: 434 na kaso ng dengue noong 2010, naging apat na lang noong 2011. [Applause]
Panimulang pag-aaral pa lamang po ito. Pero ngayon pa lang, marapat na yata nating pasalamatan sina Secretary Ike Ona ng DOH [Department of Health] at Secretary Mario Montejo ng DOST [Department of Science and Technology]. [Applause] Wala ho tayong masyadong umento, baka sa palakpak ninyo’y ganahan silang lalong magsaliksik at mag-ugnayan.
Marami pa po tayong kailangang solusyonan. Nakakabahala ang mataas pa ring maternal mortality ratio ng bansa. Kaya nga po gumagawa tayo ng mga hakbang upang tugunan ang pangangailangan sa kalusugan ng kababaihan. Nais din nating makamit ang Universal Health Care, at magkaroon ng sapat na kagamitan, pasilidad, at tauhan ang ating mga institusyong pangkalusugan.
Sa pagtugon natin sa mga ito, malaki ang maiaambag ng Sin Tax Bill. Maipasa na po sana ito sa lalong madaling panahon. [Applause] Mababawasan na ang bisyo, madadagdagan pa ang pondo para sa kalusugan.
Ano naman kaya ang sasalubong sa kabataan pagpasok sa paaralan? Sa lilim ng puno pa rin kaya sila unang matututo ng abakada? Nakasalampak pa rin kaya sila sa sahig habang nakikipag-agawan ng textbook sa kaklase nila?
Matibay po ang pananalig natin kay Secretary Luistro: Bago matapos ang susunod na taon, ubos na ang minana nating 66,800 na kakulangan sa silid-aralan. [Applause] Uulitin ko lang po, next year po ‘yan; 40,000 pa lang ho this year. Ang minana po nating 2,573,212 na backlog sa upuan, tuluyan na rin nating matutugunan bago matapos ang 2012. [Applause] Sa taon din pong ito, masisimot na rin ang 61.7 million na backlog sa textbook upang maabot na, sa wakas, ang one-is-to-one ratio ng aklat sa mag-aaral. [Applause] Sana nga po, ngayong paubos na ang backlog sa edukasyon, sikapin nating huwag uling magka-backlog dahil sa dami ng estudyante. Sa tingin ko po, Responsible Parenthood ang sagot dito. [Applause]
At para naman po hindi mapag-iwanan ang ating mga state universities and colleges (SUCs), mayroon tayong panukalang 43.61 percent na pag-angat sa kanilang budget para sa susunod na taon. [Applause] Paalala lang po: Lahat ng ginagawa natin, may direksyon; may kaakibat na kondisyon ang dagdag-budget na ito. Kailangang ipatupad ang napagkasunduang SUC Reform Roadmap ng CHED [Commission on Higher Education] at ng kaukulang mga state universities and colleges, upang siguruhing dekalidad ang magiging produkto ng mga pamantasang pinopondohan ng estado. Kung mataas ang grado ninyo sa assignment na ito, asahan naman ninyong dodoblehin din namin ang kayod para matugunan ang mga natitirang pangangailangan po ninyo. [Applause]
Panay addition po ang nagaganap sa ating budget sa edukasyon. Isipin po ninyo: Ang budget ng DepEd na ipinamana sa atin noong 2010, 177 billion pesos. Ang panukala natin para sa 2013: 292.7 billion pesos. [Applause] Noong 2010, 21.03 billion pesos ang budget para sa SUCs. Taunan po iyang dinagdagan upang umabot na sa 37.13 billion pesos na panukala natin para sa 2013. [Applause] Pero sa kabila nito, ngayon pa lang, may nagpaplano nang magcut-classes para mag-picket sa Mendiola. Ganito po kasimple: Ang 292.7 ay mas malaki sa 177, at ang 37.13 ay mas malaki sa 21.03. Kaya kung may nagsasabi o magsasabi pa ring binawasan natin ang budget ng edukasyon, kukumbinsihin na lang namin ang inyong mga paaralan na maghandog ng remedial math class para sa inyo. [Laughter and applause] At sana naman po, sa mga klaseng ‘to, pakiusap po namin, sana itong klaseng remedial na nga eh pasukan naman po ninyo.
Nang maupo tayo, at masimulan ang makabuluhang reporma, minaliit ng ilan ang pagpapakitang-gilas ng pamahalaan. Kundi raw buwenas, ningas-kugon lang itong mauupos rin paglaon. May ilan pa rin pong ayaw magretiro sa paghahasik ng negatibismo; silang mga tikom ang bibig sa good news, at ginawang industriya na ang kritisismo.
Kung may problema kayo na bago matapos ang taon, bawat bata ay may sarili nang upuan at aklat, tingnan ninyo sila, mata sa mata, at sabihin ninyong, “Ayaw kong makapag-aral ka.”
Kung masama ang loob ninyo na ang 5.2 million na pinakamahihirap na kabahayang Pilipino ay maaari nang pumasok sa ospital nang hindi iniintindi ang gastos sa pagpapagamot, tingnan ninyo sila ulit, mata sa mata, at sabihin ninyong, “Ayaw kong gumaling ka.”
Kung nagagalit kayo na may 3 milyong pamilyang Pilipino nang tumutungo sa katuparan ng kanilang mga pangarap dahil sa Pantawid Pamilya, tingnan ninyo sila, mata sa mata, at sabihin ninyong, “Ibabalik ko kayo sa kawalan ng pag-asa.” [Applause]
Tapos na ang panahon kung kailan choice lang ng makapangyarihan ang mahalaga. Halimbawa, ang dating namumuno sa TESDA [Technical Education and Skills Development Authority], nagpamudmod ng mga scholarship voucher; ang problema, wala palang nakalaang pondo para rito. Natural, tatalbog ang voucher. Ang napala: 2.4 billion pesos ang sinisingil ng mahigit 1,000 eskwelahan mula sa pamahalaan. Nagpapapogi ang isang tao’t isang administrasyon; sambayanang Pilipino naman ang pinagbabayad ngayon.
Pumasok si Secretary Joel Villanueva; [applause] hindi siya nagpasindak sa tila imposibleng pagbabagong dapat ipatupad sa kanyang ahensya. Sa kabila ng malaking utang na minana ng TESDA, 434,676 na indibidwal pa rin ang kanilang hinasa sa ilalim ng Training for Work Scholarship Program. [Applause] Konkretong tagumpay din po ang hatid ng TESDA Specialista Technopreneurship Program (mas mahirap pong bigkasin kaysa sa resulta). Biruin po ninyo, bawat isa sa 5,240 na sertipikadong Specialistas, kumikita na ngayon ng 562 pesos kada araw o 11,240 pesos kada buwan. Mas malaki pa po ito sa minimum wage. [Applause]
Mula sa pagkasanggol, hanggang sa pagkabinata, gumagana na ang sistema para sa mamamayan. Sinisiguro nating manganganak ng trabaho ang pagsigla ng ating ekonomiya.
Alalahanin po natin, para tumabla lang, kailangang makalikha taun-taon ng 1 milyong bagong trabaho para sa mga new entrants. Ang nalikha po natin sa loob ng dalawang taon: halos 3.1 million na bagong trabaho. [Applause]
Ito po ang dahilan kung bakit pababa nang pababa ang unemployment rate sa bansa. Nang dumating tayo, 8 percent ang unemployment rate. Naging 7.2 ito noong Abril ng 2011, at bumaba pa lalo sa 6.9 ngayong taon, sa buwan rin ng Abril. [Applause] Di po ba makatwirang mangarap na balang araw, bawat Pilipinong handang magbanat ng buto, may mapapasukang trabaho?
Tingnan na lamang po natin ang BPO [business process outsourcing] sector. Noong taong 2000, 5,000 katao lang ang naempleyo sa industriyang ito. Fast forward po tayo ngayon: 638,000 katao na ang nabibigyang trabaho ng mga BPO, at 11 bilyong dolyar ang ipinasok nito sa ating ekonomiya noong taong 2011. [Applause] Ang projection nga po ng industriya, pagdating ng 2016, kung saan ako po ay magpapaalam na sa inyo, 25 billion dollars na ang maipapasok nito, at makakapag-empleyo ng 1.3 million na mga Pilipino. [Applause] Hindi pa po kasama rito ang tinatayang aabot sa 3.2 million na mga taxi driver, barista, mga sari-sari store, karinderya, at marami pang ibang makikinabang sa mga indirect jobs na malilikha dahil sa BPO industry.
Malaking bahagi din po ng ating job-generation strategy ang pagpapatayo ng sapat na imprastraktura. Sa mga nakapagbakasyon na sa Boracay, nakita na naman ninyo ang bagong-binyag nating terminal sa Caticlan. Nakalatag na rin po ang plano upang palawakin ang runway nito.
Magkakaroon pa po ‘yan ng mga kapatid. Bago matapos ang aking termino, nakatayo na ang New Bohol Airport sa Panglao, [applause] New Legaspi Airport sa Daraga, at Laguindingan Airport sa Misamis Oriental. [Applause] Ia-upgrade na rin po natin ang ating international airports sa Mactan, Puerto Princesa, at Tacloban. [Applause] Dagdag pa po diyan ang pagpapaganda ng mga airport sa Butuan, Cotabato, Dipolog, Pagadian, Tawi-Tawi, Southern Leyte, at San Vicente sa Palawan. [Applause] Kami po sa Tarlac ay maghihintay na lang. [Laughter]
Pang-apat na Pangulo na po akong sasalo sa problema ng NAIA 3. Hindi lang po eroplano ang nag-take off at nag-landing dito; maging mga problema’t anomalya, lumapag din. Nagbitiw na po ng salita si Secretary Mar Roxas: Bago tayo magkita sa susunod na SONA, maisasaayos na ang mga structural defects na minana natin sa NAIA 3. [Applause]
Nitong Hunyo po, nagsimula na ring umusad ang proseso para sa LRT Line 1 Cavite Extension project, na magpapaluwag sa trapik ng Las Piñas, Parañaque, at Cavite. [Applause] Dagdag pa diyan, para lalong mapaluwag ang traffic sa Kamaynilaan at mapabilis ang pagtawid mula North Luzon hanggang South Luzon Expressway, magkakaroon ng dalawang elevated NLEX-SLEX connector. Matatapos po ang mga ito sa 2015. [Applause] Magiging 1 hour and 40 minutes na lang ang biyaheng Clark papuntang Calamba oras na makumpleto ang mga ito. Bago po tayo bumaba sa puwesto, nakatayo na rin ang mga dekalidad na terminal sa Taguig, Quezon City, at Parañaque na paparadahan ng bus biyaheng probinsya, [applause] upang hindi na sila makisiksik pa sa EDSA.
Nagbago na po ang takbo ng usapan tungkol sa ahensyang dati’y itinuturing na pugad ng kapalpakan. Naalala ko po dati: Kapag tag-ulan at umapaw ang Tarlac River, nalulunod ang MacArthur Highway. Tutunawin nito ang aspalto; magbabaku-bako ang kalsada hanggang sa tuluyan na nga itong mawawala. Bilang kinatawan noon ng aking distrito, inireklamo ko po ito. Ang tugon ng DPWH [Department of Public Works and Highways]: Alam namin ang problema, alam namin ang solusyon, pero wala kaming pera. Kinailangan ko pong makiusap sa aking mga barangay, at ang sabi ko po sa kanila ay, “Kung hindi natin ito uunahin, walang gagawa nito, at tayo rin ang mapeperhuwisyo.” Dati, panay ang “hoy, gising!” sa gobyerno, bakit wala daw kasing ginagawa. Ngayon ang reklamo, “Sobra namang trapik, ang dami kasing ginagawa.” [Laughter and applause] Paalala lang din po: Naisasaayos na natin ang mga kalsadang ito nang hindi nagtataas ng buwis. [Applause]
Bubuo tayo ng mga daanan, hindi ayon sa kickback o kursonada, pero ayon sa isang malinaw na sistema. Dahil hindi na bara-bara ang paglalagak natin ng pondo para sa mga proyekto, hindi na ito mapapako sa plano, totoong kalsada na ang pakikinabangan ng Pilipino. Nang maupo po tayo sa puwesto, 7,239 kilometers sa ating national road network ang hindi pa naisasaayos. One thousand five hundred and sixty-nine kilometers na nito ang naipaayos natin sa ilalim ng pamamahala ni Secretary Babes Singson; [applause] sa 2012, 2,275 kilometers pa ang maidadagdag na natapos na rin po. Pati po ang mga kalsada at kurbadang mapanganib, tinutukoy at inaayos na gamit ang pinakabagong teknolohiya. Taun-taon po nating bubunuin ito, upang bago matapos ang aking termino, bawat pulgada ng ating national road network, maayos na po. Siyempre ‘wag lang po n’yo dagdagan ang national road network.
Hindi lang kalsada, kundi pati sistema, isinasaayos sa DPWH. Dahil sa pagsunod sa tamang proseso ng bidding at procurement, 10.6 billion pesos na ang natipid ng kanilang ahensya mula 2011 hanggang nitong Hunyo. [Applause] Maging mga kontratista, batid ang positibong bunga ng reporma sa DPWH. Sabi nga po nila, “Ang top 40 na kontratista, fully booked na raw po.”
Sana po hindi maantala ang pagpapatayo natin ng iba pang imprastraktura para hindi rin mapurnada ang paglago ng ibang industriya.
Kaakibat ng pagpapaunlad ng imprastraktura ang paglago ng turismo. Isipin po ninyo: Noong 2001, ang tourist arrivals sa ating bansa, 1.8 million. Nang dumating po tayo noong 2010, naglalaro ito sa 3.1 million. Mantakin po ninyo: Sa hinaba-haba ng kanilang administrasyon, ang naidagdag nilang tourist arrivals, 1.3 million lamang; may ambag pa kaming kalahating taon diyan. Tayo naman po, Hunyo pa lang ng 2012, 2.1 million na turista na ang napalapag. [Applause] Mas marami pang dadagsa sa peak season bago matapos ang taon, kaya hindi ako nagdududang maaabot natin ang quota na 4.6 million na turista para sa 2012. [Applause] Ibig sabihin po, 1.5 million na turista ang ating maidadagdag. Samakatuwid, sa dalawang taon, mas malaki ang magiging paglago ng ating tourist arrivals, kumpara sa naidagdag ng pinalitan natin sa loob ng siyam at kalahating taon. Hindi po tayo nagtataas ng bangko; nagsasabi lang po tayo ng totoo. [Applause]
Pero hindi nakuntento rito si Secretary Mon Jimenez. Sabi niya, kung sa Malaysia may bumisitang 24.7 million na turista noong 2011, at kung sa Thailand naman tinatayang 17 million, sa dinami-dami ng magagandang tanawin sa ating bansa, hindi naman siguro suntok sa buwan kung mangarap tayong pagdating ng 2016, 10 milyong turista na ang bibisita sa Pilipinas kada taon. [Applause] Kung patuloy na magkakaisa ang sambayanang Pilipino, gaya ng ipinamalas nating hirangin ang Puerto Princesa Underground River bilang isa sa New Seven Wonders of Nature, walang dudang makakamtan natin ito. Ang pahayag nga po natin sa daigdig: “It’s more fun in the Philippines.” [Applause] Kahit wala pang isang taon sa puwesto si Secretary Mon Jimenez, nagagapas na natin ang positibong bunga ng ating mga naipunlang reporma. Masasabi nga po nating pagdating sa turismo, “It’s really fun—to have Secretary Mon Jimenez as our Secretary.” [Applause]
Kung paglago po ang usapan, nasa tuktok ng listahan ang agrikultura. Kayod-kalabaw po si Secretary Alcala upang makapaghatid ng mabubuting balita. [Applause] Binisita po niya ang lahat ng probinsya hindi para mangampanya sa sarili pero para ikampanya ang programa ng Department of Agriculture. Dati, para bang ang pinapalago ng mga namumuno sa Department of Agriculture ay ang utang ng NFA [National Food Authority]. Twelve billion pesos ang minana nilang utang; ang ipinamana naman nila sa atin, 177 billion pesos.
Hindi po ba’t noon, pinaniwala tayo na 1.3 million metric tons ang kakulangan sa bigas, at para tugunan ito, di bababa sa 2 million metric tons ang kanilang inangkat noong 2010. Parang unlimited rice sila kung maka-order ng bigas, pero dahil sobra-sobra, nabubulok lang naman ito sa mga bodega. Ang 1.3 million metric tons, unang taon pa lang, napababa na natin sa 860,000 metric tons. [Applause] Ngayong taon, 500,000 na lang, kasama pa ang buffer sakaling abutin tayo ng bagyo. [Applause] Huwag lang po tayong pagsungitan ng panahon, harinawa sa susunod na taon ay puwede na tayong mag-export ng bigas. [Applause]
Ang sabi po ni Secretary Alcala: Ang susi dito, makatotohanang programa sa irigasyon at masigasig na implementasyon ng certified seeds program. [Applause] Ang masakit po, hindi bagong kaalaman ito; hindi lang ipinapatupad. Kung dati pa sila nagtrabaho nang matino, nasaan na kaya tayo ngayon?
Tingnan rin po natin ang industriya ng niyog at ang cocowater na dati tinatapon lang, ngayon, napapakinabangan na ng magsasaka. Noong 2009, 483,862 liters ng cocowater ang iniluwas natin. Umangat po ito ng 1,807,583 liters noong 2010. Huwag po kayong magugulat, noong 2011, 16,756,498 liters [Applause]—puwede ho bang ulitin iyon?—16,756,498 liters ng cocowater ang in-export ng Pilipinas. Ang coco coir naman, kung dati walang pumapansin, ngayon may shortage na dahil pinapakyaw ng mga exporter. Hindi natin sasayangin ang pagkakataong ito. Bibili pa tayo ng mga bagong makinang magpoproseso ng bunot para makuha ang mga hiblang ginagawa mula sa coco coir. Sa susunod na taon, lalo nating mapapakinabangan ang industriya ng niyog. Naglaan na tayo ng 1.75 billion pesos upang mamuhunan at palaguin ito. [Applause]
Sinimulan po ng aking ina ang Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). Nararapat lamang na matapos ang programang ito sa panahon ng aking panunungkulan. [Applause]
Isinasaayos na po ang sistema upang mapabilis ang pagpapatupad ng repormang agraryo. Ginagawa ng pamahalaan ang lahat ng hakbang upang maipamahagi sa ating magsasaka ang mga lupaing diniligan at pinagyaman ng kanilang pawis. Subalit mayroon pa rin pong ayaw paawat sa pagtatanim ng mga balakid. Ang tugon ko sa kanila: Susunod tayo sa batas. Ang atas ng batas, ang atas ng taumbayan, at ang atas ko: Bago ako bumaba sa puwesto, naipamigay na dapat ang lahat ng lupaing sakop ng CARP. [Applause]
Liwanagin naman po natin ang nangyayari sa sektor ng enerhiya. Mantakin po ninyo: Dati po, umabot lang ang kawad ng kuryente sa barangay hall, “energized” na raw ang buong barangay. Kaya ganoon na lang kung ipagmalaki nilang 99.98 percent na raw ng mga barangay sa bansa ang may kuryente. Pati ba naman sa serbisyong dapat ay matagal nang napapakinabangan ng Pilipino, nagkakagulangan pa? Kaya nga po, para subukan ang kakayahan ng DOE [Department of Energy] at NEA [National Electrification Administration], naglaan tayo ng 1.3 billion pesos para pailawan ang unang target na 1,300 sitios, sa presyong 1 milyong piso bawat isa. Nang matapos sila, ang napailawan sa inilaan nating pondo: 1,520 sitios, at gumastos lamang sila ng 814 million pesos. [Applause] Nagawa nila ito sa loob lamang ng tatlong buwan, at mas marami pa pong gagawin sa taong ito hanggang maubos ‘yang 36,000 na sitiong walang kuryente. Kay Secretary Rene Almendras, bilib talaga ako sa iyo; [applause] parang hindi ka nauubusan ng enerhiya. Sa paghahatid-serbisyo, hindi ka lang ever-ready, nagmistulang Energizer bunny ka pa—you keep on going, and going, and going. [Applause]
Nangingibabaw na nga po ang liwanag sa ating bayan—liwanag na nagsiwalat sa krimeng nagaganap sa madidilim na sulok ng lipunan. Ang pinagsisikapang kitain ng Pilipino, hindi na magagantso. Patuloy po ang pagbaba ng crime volume sa buong bansa. Ang mahigit 500,000 krimen na naitala noong 2009, mahigit kalahati po ang nabawas: 246,958 na lamang iyan nitong 2011. Dagdag pa rito, ang dating 2,200 kaso ng carnapping noong 2010, lampas kalahati rin ang ibinaba; 966 na lang po iyan pagdating ng 2011.
Ito nga po sana ang dalhin ng ating mga headline. Hindi po natin sinasabing wala nang krimeng nagaganap, pero palagay ko naman po, wala dapat magalit na nangalahati na ito. Si Raymond Dominguez na matagal nang labas-masok sa kulungan, hindi ba’t sa loob lamang ng mahigit isang taon, nasentensyahan at naipakulong na? Ang dalawa pa niyang kapatid ay sinampahan na rin natin ng kaso at kasalukuyan na ring nakabilanggo. May dalawang suspect sa bus bombing sa Makati noong nakaraang taon, ang isa po’y pumanaw na; ‘yung isa, humihimas na ng rehas. Kakosa niya ang mahigit 10,000 sangkot sa ilegal na droga na inaresto ng PDEA [Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency] nitong 2011. [Applause]
Alam po nating hindi araw-araw ang laban ni Pacman, at hindi puwedeng iasa dito ang pagbaba ng krimen. Kaya nga po pinalalakas natin ang puwersa ng kapulisan. Di po ba, nang dumating tayo, 45 porsyento ng ating kapulisan ang walang baril at umaasa sa anting-anting habang tumutugis ng masasamang-loob? [Laughter] Mayroon pong nanalo na sa bidding, tinitiyak na lamang nating dekalidad ang kanilang mga produkto. Pagkatapos ng proseso, at itong taon po nating inaasahan ito, maipagkakaloob na ang 74,600 na baril na magagamit nila upang ipagtanggol at alagaan ang bayan, lipunan, at sarili. [Applause]
Dumako naman po tayo sa usapin ng pambansang tanggulan. May mga nagsabi na po na ang ating Air Force, “all air, at no force.” [Laughter] Imbes na alagaan ng estado, para bang sinasadyang ilagay sa alanganin ang ating mga sundalo. Hindi po tayo makakapayag na manatiling ganito.
Makalipas nga lang po ang isang taon at pitong buwan, nakapaglaan na tayo ng mahigit 28 bilyong piso para sa AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Modernization Program. Aabutan na nito ang 33 bilyong pisong pondo na ipinagkaloob sa nasabing programa sa nakalipas na 15 taon. [Applause] Bumubuwelo pa lang po tayo sa lagay na ‘yan. Kapag naipasa na ang panukala nating AFP modernization bill sa Kongreso, makakapaglaan tayo ng 75 bilyong piso para sa susunod na limang taon.
Kasado na rin po ang tatlumpung milyong dolyar na pondong kaloob ng Estados Unidos para sa Defense Capability Upgrade and Sustainment of Equipment Program ng AFP. Bukod pa po ito sa tulong nila upang pahusayin pa ang pagmanman sa ating mga baybayin sa ilalim ng itatayong Coast Watch Center ng Pilipinas.
Nagka-canvass na rin po ang Sandatahang Lakas ng mga kagamitan tulad ng mga kanyon, armored personnel carrier, at frigates. Hindi magtatagal, dadaong na ang karelyebo ng BRP Gregorio del Pilar sa ating pampang. Sa Enero, aangkla na po sa Pilipinas ang BRP Ramon Alcaraz, ang pangalawa nating Hamilton class cutter. Di na po bangkang papel ang ating ipapalaot; [applause] ngayon, mga high-tech at dekalidad na barko na ang tatanod sa 36,000 kilometers nating coastline.
Mainam na rin po siguro kung maglilinis-linis na ng mga hangar ang ating Sandatahang Lakas, dahil darating na ang mga kagamitang lalong magpapatikas sa ating tanggulan. Sa wakas, may katuwang na po ang kaisa-isa nating C-130 na 36 na taon nang rumoronda sa himpapawid. Dalawa pang C-130 ang magiging operational ulit sa taong ito. Bago matapos ang taong ito, inaasahan nating maide-deliver na ang binili nating 21 refurbished UH-1H Helicopter, 4 na combat utility helicopters, mga radyo’t iba pang communication equipment, rifles, mortars, mobile diagnostic laboratories, kasama na ang bullet station assembly para sa arsenal. [Applause] Pagdating naman po ng 2013, lalapag na ang 10 attack helicopters, 2 naval helicopters, 2 light lift aircraft, 1 frigate, at mga force protection equipment. [Applause]
At hindi lang po natin sa armas ipinaparamdam ang pagkalinga sa ating pulis at kasundaluhan. Nabawasan na rin po ang mga pasanin nila sa pamumuhay dahil sa mahigit 22,000 bahay ang naipatayo na sa ilalim ng AFP–PNP housing program. [Applause]
Hindi po ito tungkol sa pakikipaggirian o pakikipagmatigasan. Hindi ito tungkol sa pagsisiga-sigaan. Tungkol ito sa pagkamit ng kapayapaan. Tungkol ito sa kakayahan nating ipagtanggol ang ating sarili—isang bagay na kay tagal nating inisip na imposible. Tungkol po ito sa buhay ng isang sundalong araw-araw sumasabak sa peligro; tungkol ito sa pamilya niyang nag-aabang na makabalik siyang ligtas, ano man ang kanyang makaharap. Hayaan nating ang ilang mga benipisyaryo ang magsabi sa pagbabago ng buhay po nila:
[Video starts]
“Nagpapasalamat sa Poong Maykapal. Binigyan kami ng ganitong pagkakataon—binigyan ng blessing na ganito. Pangalawa, ‘yung pagkakaroon natin ng mabait na pangulo. Itong proyekto na ito ay hindi niya kami pinababayaan—mga kapulisan at mga sundalo—sandatahan ng ating Pilipinas.”
—SPO1 Domingo Medalla, PNP Housing Beneficiary
“Kinakaya namin, ma’am. Pero ginagawan ko talaga ng paraan na makapasok sila [sa eskuwela]. ‘Yun lang talaga, ma’am, ang misyon ko sa buhay na mapaaral sila, maibigay ko ‘yung tamang edukasyon, na hindi maging gusgusin ang anak ko, hindi kaawa-awa[an] ng mga tao, may magulang na dapat magtaguyod. At nagpapasalamat ako sa Pantawid [Pamilya Program], ma’am, dahil may natutunan ako ditong malaki.”
—Eva Neri, CCT beneficiary
“Malaking tulong na isa kami—ang alam ko kauna-unahan na nakinabang at nakikinabang pa sa package na ‘to na Category Z Package ng PhilHealth. Nagpapasalamat kami nang sobra at hindi man maganda na nagkaroon ng sakit ang anak ko, pero mayroong PhilHealth na tutulong at handang tumulong sa mga gastusin namin.”
—Kristine Tatualla, PhilHealth beneficiary
“Noong araw na nasama ako sa isang Oakwood Mutiny—‘yung pinaglalaban namin, ito na po ‘yung hinihintay namin para sa pagbabago at ito na po ang pagkakataon natin para magkaroon tayo ng sariling bahay lalung-lalo na sa programa ng ating presidente na si Benigno Aquino III.”
—PFC Rolly Bernal, AFP Housing Beneficiary
[Video ends]
At ngayon ngang inaaruga na sila ng taumbayan, lalo namang ginaganahan ang ating kasundaluhan na makamtan ang kapayapaan. Tagumpay pong maituturing ang 203 rebeldeng sumuko at nagbabalik-loob na sa lipunan, at ang 1,772 na bandidong nawakasan na ang karahasan. Halimbawa po, ang kilabot na teroristang si Doctor Abu, na hindi na makakapaghasik ng kaniyang lagim. Nagpupugay rin po tayo sa panunumbalik sa katahimikan sa mga lugar na matagal nang biningi ng putukan. Ang resulta nga po ng bayanihan: 365 na barangay ang naagaw sa kamay ng kaaway, 270 na gusali’t paaralan ang naipaayos, at 74 health centers ang naipagawa. [Applause]
Kung kapayapaan na lang din po ang usapan, dumako naman tayo sa lugar na matagal naging mukha ng mga mithiing di makamtan-kamtan. Bago po magsimula ang mga reporma natin sa ARMM [Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao], at alam naman po n’yo, may mga ghost students doon, na naglalakad sa isang ghost road, tungo sa isang ghost school, para magpaturo sa isang ghost teacher. Ang mga aparisyon pong gumulantang kay OIC Governor Mujiv Hataman: [applause] Apat na eskuwelahan na natagpuang may ghost students; iniimbestigahan na rin ang mga teacher na hindi lumilitaw ang pangalan sa talaan ng Professional Regulation Commission, gayundin ang mga tauhan ng gobyernong hindi nakalista sa plantilya. Limampu’t limang ghost entry ang tinanggal sa payroll. Ang dating paulit-ulit na pagsasaboy ng graba sa kalsada para lang pagkakitaan ng pera, bawal na. Wala nang cash advance sa mga ahensya, para maiwasan ang pagsasamantala. Ang mga multo sa voters list, mapapatahimik na ang kaluluwa. [Applause] Kaya nga po kay OIC Gov. Mujiv Hataman, ang masasabi natin: talaga namang isa ka nang certified ghost buster. [Laughter]
Ang pumalit po, at pinapalit na: pabahay, tulay, at learning center para sa mga Badjao sa Basilan. Mga community-based hatchery, lambat, materyales para maglinang ng seaweeds, at punlang napakinabangan ng 2,588 na mangingisda. Certified seeds, punla ng gabi, cassava, goma, at mga punong namumunga para sa 145,121 na magsasaka. Simula pa lang po iyan; nakalaan na ang 183 million pesos para sa mga municipal fishing port projects sa ARMM; 310.4 million pesos para sa mga istasyon ng bumbero; 515 million pesos para sa malinis na inuming tubig; 551.9 million pesos para sa mga kagamitang pangkalusugan; 691.9 million pesos para sa day care centers; at 2.85 billion pesos para sa mga kalsada at tulay na babagtas sa rehiyon. Ilan lang po iyan sa patutunguhan ng kabuuang 8.59 billion pesos na ipinagkaloob ng pambansang gobyerno para isakatuparan ang mga reporma sa ARMM. [Applause] Lilinawin ko rin po, hindi pa kasama rito ang taunang suportang natatanggap nila, na ngayong 2012 ay umabot sa 11.7 billion pesos. [Applause]
Maski po ang mga dating gustong tumiwalag, nakikita na ang epekto ng reporma. Kinikilala natin bilang pahiwatig ng kanilang tiwala ang nakaraang pitong buwan, kung kailan walang nangyaring sagupaan sa pagitan ng militar at ng MILF [Moro Islamic Liberation Front]. Sa peace process naman po, hayag at lantaran ang usapan. Nagpapamalas ang magkabilang panig ng tiwala sa isa’t isa. Maaaring minsan, magiging masalimuot ang proseso; signos lang po ito na malapit na nating makamit ang nag-iisa nating mithiin: kapayapaan.
Mapayapang pag-uusap rin po ang prinsipyong isinulong natin upang mabuo ang ating Executive Order ukol sa pagmimina. Ang kaisipan sa likod ng nabuong consensus: mapakinabangan ang ating likas na yaman upang iangat ang buhay ng Pilipino, hindi lamang ngayon kundi pati na rin sa susunod na salinlahi. Hindi natin pipitasin ang ginintuang bunga ng industriyang ito, kung ang magiging kabayaran ay ang pagkasira ng kalikasan. [Applause]
Ngunit unang hakbang lamang ito. Isipin po ninyo, noong 2010, 145 billion pesos ang kabuuang halaga na nakuha mula sa pagmimina, subalit 13.4 billion pesos lamang o 9 porsyento ang napunta sa kaban ng bayan. Ang likas na yaman, pag-aari ninyo; hindi tayo papayag na balato lang ang mapupunta sa Pilipino. Umaasa po tayo sa pakikiisa ng Kongreso upang makapagpasa ng batas na sisigurong napapangalagaan ang kalikasan at matitiyak na makatarungan ang magiging pakinabang ng publiko at pribadong sektor sa mga biyayang makukuha natin mula sa industriyang ito. [Applause]
Pag-usapan po natin ang situwasyon sa Disaster Risk Reduction and Management. Dati, ang gobyernong dapat tumutulong, nanghihingi rin ng tulong. Ngayon, nasa Pasipiko pa lang ang bagyo, alam na kung saan idedestino ang ayuda, at may malinaw nang plano upang maiwasan ang peligro.
Tuwing pag-uusapan nga po ang sakuna, lagi kong naaalala ang nangyari po sa amin sa Tarlac noong minsang bumagyo. Sa lakas ng ulan, bumigay ang isang dike. Nang nagising ang atin pong barangay captain, tinangay na ng baha ang kanyang bahay at mga kagamitang pangsaka. Buti nga po’t nailigtas ang buong mag-anak. Malas lang po ng kalabaw nilang naiwang nakatali sa puno; nabigti ito sa lakas ng ragasa.
Walang kalaban-laban din po ang marami sa tinamaan ng bagyong Ondoy, Pepeng, at Sendong. Napakarami pong nasawi sa paghagupit ng mga delubyong ito. Sa ilalim ng bagong-lunsad na Project NOAH, isinakay natin sa iisang bangka ang mga inisyatiba kontra-sakuna, at hindi na rin po idinadaan sa tsamba ang paglilikas sa mga pamilya. Gamit ang teknolohiya, nabibigyan na ng wastong babala ang Pilipino upang makapaghanda at makaiwas sa disgrasya.
Real-time at direkta na ang pakinabang ng 86 na automated rain gauges at 28 water level monitoring sensors natin sa iba’t ibang rehiyon. Bago matapos ang 2013, ang target natin: 600 automated rain gauges at 422 water level sensors. Ipapakabit po natin ang mga ito sa 18 pangunahing river basins sa buong bansa. [Applause]
Isa pa pong pagbabago: Dati, ang mga ahensya’y kanya-kanyang habulan ng numero, kanya-kanyang agenda, kanya-kanyang pasikatan. Ngayon, ang kultura sa gobyerno: bayanihan para sa kapakanan ng taumbayan. Convergence po ang tawag natin dito.
Dati pa naman po naglipana ang mga programa sa tree planting. Pero matapos magtanim, pababayaan na lang ang mga ito. Kapag nakita ng mga komunidad na naghahanap din ng kabuhayan, puputulin ang mga ito para gawing uling.
May solusyon na po rito. Mayroon na pong 128,558 hectares ng kagubatang naitanim sa buong bansa; bahagi lang po iyan ng kabuuang 1.5 million na ektaryang matatamnan bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto. [Applause] Nakapaloob po rito ang mga komunidad na nasa ilalim ng National Convergence Initiative. Ang proseso: pagkatanim ng puno, makikipag-ugnayan ang DSWD sa mga komunidad. Kapalit ng conditional cash transfer, aalagaan ang mga puno; mayroon ding mga magpapalago ng bagong punla sa nursery. Three hundred thirty-five thousand and seventy-eight na po ang mga Pilipinong nakakakuha ng kabuhayan mula dito.
Sa isa nga pong programa, nakiambag din ang pribadong sektor, na nagbibigay ng espesyal na binhi ng kape at cacao sa komunidad, at tinuturuan silang alagaan at siguruhing mataas ang ani. Itinatanim ang kape sa ilalim ng mga puno, na habang nakatayo ay masisigurong hihigop ng baha at tutulong makaiwas tayo sa pinsala. Ang kumpanyang nagbigay ng binhi, sure buyer na rin ng ani. Panalo po ang mga komunidad na may dagdag kita, panalo ang pribadong sektor, panalo pa ang susunod na salinlahing makikinabang sa matatayog na puno. [Applause]
Matagal na pong problema ang illegal logging. Mula nga po nang lumapag ang EO 23, nakasabat na si Mayor Jun Amante ng mahigit 6 milyong pisong halaga ng troso. Nagpapasalamat tayo sa kanya. Sa Butuan pa lang ito; paano pa kung magpapakita ng ganitong political will ang lahat ng mga LGU [local government unit]?
Ang mga trosong nakukumpiska ng DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources], lalapag sa mga komunidad na naturuan na ng TESDA ng pagkakarpintero. Ang resulta: upuan para sa mga pampublikong paaralan na hawak naman ng DepEd. Isipin po ninyo, ang dating pinagmumulan ng pinsala, ngayon, tulay na para sa mas mabuting kinabukasan. Dati, imposible nga ito; imposible kung nagbubulag-bulagan ang pamahalaan sa ilegal na gawain.
Kaya kayong mga walang konsensya; kayong mga paulit-ulit isinusugal ang buhay ng kapwa Pilipino: maghanda na kayo. Tapos na ang maliligayang araw po ninyo. [Applause] Sinampolan na natin ang 34 na kawani ng DENR, 1 PNP provincial director, at 7 chiefs of police. Pinagpapaliwanag na rin po natin ang isang regional director ng PNP na nagbingi-bingihan sa aking utos at nagbulag-bulagan sa mga dambuhalang trosong dumaan sa kanilang tanawin. Kung hindi kayo umayos, isusunod namin kayo. Magkubli man kayo sa ilalim ng inyong mga padrino, aabutan namin kayo. Isasama na rin namin ang mga padrino ninyo. [Applause] Kaya bago pa magkasalubong ang ating landas, ako po’y muling makikiusap, mas maganda sigurong tumino na kayo.
Mula sa sinapupunan, sa pag-aaral, at sa pagtatrabaho, may pagbabago nang haharap sa Pilipino. At sakaling piliin niyang magserbisyo sa gobyerno, tuloy pa rin ang pag-aaruga ng estado hanggang sa kanyang pagreretiro. Tatanawin ng pamahalaan ang kanyang ambag bilang lingkod-bayan, at hindi ipagdadamot sa kanya ang pensiyong siya rin naman ang nagpuhunan.
Isipin po ninyo, at ako po’y nagulat dito: may mga pensyonado tayong tumatanggap ng 500 pesos lamang kada buwan. Paano kaya niya ito pagkakasiyahin sa tubig, kuryente, at pagkain araw-araw? Ang atin pong tugon: Pagsapit ng bagong taon, hindi na bababa sa 5,000 piso ang matatanggap na buwanang pensyon ng ating old-age and disability pensioners. [Applause] Masaya tayong matutugunan natin ang pangangailangan nila ngayon, nang hindi isinusugal ang kapakanan ng mga pensyonado bukas.
Iba na po talaga ang mukha ng gobyerno. Sumasabay na po sa pribadong sektor ang ating pasahod para sa entry level. Pero kapag sabay kayong na-promote ng kaklase mong piniling mag-pribado, nagkakaiwanan na.
Mahahabol din po natin iyan; pero sa ngayon po, ang good news natin sa mga nagtatrabaho sa pamahalaan: Performance-Based Incentives. Dati, maski palpak ang palakad ng isang ahensya, very satisfactory pa rin ang pinakamababang rating ng empleyado. Dahil sa pakikisama, nahihirapan ang bisor na bigyan ng makatarungang rating ang mga tauhan niya. Nakakawawa tuloy ang mga mahusay magtrabaho. Nawawalan sila ng dahilan para galingan dahil parehas lang naman ang insentibo ng mga tamad at pursigido.
Heto po ang isa lamang sa mga hakbang natin upang tugunan ito. Simula ngayong taon, magpapatupad tayo ng sistema kung saan ang bonus ay nakabase sa pagtupad ng mga ahensya sa kanilang mga target para sa taon. [Applause] Nasa kamay na ng empleyado ang susi sa kanyang pag-angat. Ang insentibo, maaaring umabot ng 35,000 piso, depende sa pagpapakitang-gilas mo sa iyong trabaho. Dagdag pa ito sa across-the-board na Christmas bonus na matatanggap mo.
Ginagawa natin ito, hindi lamang para itaas ang kumpiyansa at ipakita ang pagtitiwala natin sa ating mga lingkod-bayan. Higit sa lahat, para ito sa Pilipinong umaasa sa tapat at mahusay na serbisyo mula sa lingkod-bayan, at umaasang sila at sila lamang ang itinuturing na boss ng kanilang pamahalaan. [Applause]
Alam po niyo, sa simula pa lang mayroon nang mga kumukuwestiyon sa sinasabi nating, “Kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap.” Hanggang ngayon mayroon pa rin pong mangilan-ngilang nagtatanong: Nakakain ba ang mabuting pamamahala? Ang simpleng sagot, “Siyempre.”
Isipin po natin ang ating pinanggalingan: Dati, parang “Wild West” ang pamumuhunan sa Pilipinas. May peligro na nga ang negosyo, sinagad pa ang risko dahil sa di tiyak at nakalihim na patakaran. Kakamayan ka gamit ang kanan, kokotongan ka naman na gamit ang kaliwa.
Ngayon, dahil patas na ang laban, at may hayag at hindi pabagu-bagong mga patakaran, patuloy ang pagtaas ng kumpiyansa sa ating ekonomiya. Patuloy ang pagpasok ng puhunan; patuloy ang pagdami ng trabaho; patuloy ang positibong siklo ng pagkonsumo, paglago ng negosyo, at pagdami ng mamamayang naeempleyo. [Applause]
Dahil maayos ang paggugol ng gobyerno, walang tagas sa sistema. Dahil maayos ang pangkolekta ng buwis, lumalago ang kaban ng bayan. Bawat pisong nakokolekta, tiyak ang pupuntahan: Piso itong diretso sa kalsada, piso para sa bakuna, piso para sa classroom at upuan, piso para sa ating kinabukasan. [Applause]
Dahil maayos ang paggawa ng tulay, kalsada, at gusali, itinatayo ang mga ito kung saan kailangan. Maayos ang daanan, mas mabilis ang takbo ng produkto, serbisyo, at mamamayan.
Dahil maayos ang pamamahala sa agrikultura, tumataas ang produksyon ng pagkain, at hindi pumapalo ang presyo nito. Stable ang pasahod, at mas malakas ang pambansang ekonomiya.
Tunay nga po, ang matatag at malakas na ekonomiyang pinanday ng mabuting pamamahala ang pinakamabisang kalasag laban sa mga hamon na kinakaharap ng daigdig. Dalawang taon po nating binaklas ang mga balakid sa pag-unlad, at ngayon, tayo na lang mismo ang makakapigil sa ating sariling pag-angat.
Ginawa po natin ang lahat ng ito habang binubuno rin ng bawat bansa sa iba’t ibang sulok ng daigdig ang kani-kanilang problema’t pagsubok.
Hindi po tayo nag-iisa sa mundo, kaya’t habang tinutugunan natin ang sarili nating mga suliranin, angkop lamang na bantayan din ang ilang pangyayaring maaaring makaapekto sa atin.
Naging maugong ang mga kaganapan sa Bajo de Masinloc. May mga mangingisdang Tsinong pumasok sa ating teritoryo. Nasabat ng barko natin at nasabat sa kanilang mga barko ang endangered species. Bilang pinuno, kailangan kong ipatupad ang batas na umiiral sa ating bansa. Sa pagsulong nito, nagbungguan ang Nine-Dash Line Theory ng mga Tsino, na umaangkin sa halos buong West Philippine Sea, at ang karapatan natin at ng marami pang ibang bansa, kasama na ang Tsina, na pinagtibay naman ng United Nations Convention on the Laws of the Sea.
Ibayong hinahon ang ipinamalas natin. Ang barko ng Hukbong Dagat, bilang tanda ng ating malinis na hangarin, ay agad nating pinalitan ng barkong sibilyan. Hindi tayo nakipagsagutan sa mga banat ng kanilang media sa atin. Hindi naman po siguro kalabisan na hilingin sa kabilang panig na galangin ang ating karapatan, gaya ng paggalang sa kanilang mga karapatan bilang kapwa bansang nasa iisang mundong kailangang pagsaluhan.
Mayroon po tayong mga miron na nagsasabing hayaan na lang ang Bajo de Masinloc; umiwas na lang tayo. Pero kung may pumasok sa inyong bakuran at sinabing sa kanya na ang kanyang kinatatayuan ay sa kanya na, papayag ba kayo? Hindi naman po yata tamang ipamigay na lang natin sa iba ang sadyang atin talaga. [Applause]
Kaya nga po hinihiling ko sa sambayanan ang pakikiisa sa isyung ito. Iisa lang po dapat ang kumpas natin. Tulungan ninyo akong iparinig sa kabilang panig ang katuwiran ng ating mga paninindigan.
Hindi po simple ang sitwasyon, at hindi magiging simple ang solusyon. Magtiwala po kayo, kumukonsulta tayo sa mga eksperto, at sa lahat ng pinuno ng ating bansa, pati na sa mga kaalyado natin—gayundin sa mga nasa kabilang panig ng usaping ito—upang makahanap ng solusyon na katanggap-tanggap sa lahat. [Applause]
Sa bawat hakbang sa tuwid na daan, nagpunla tayo ng pagbabago. Ngunit may mangilan-ngilan pa ring pilit na bubunot nito. Habang nagtatalumpati ako ngayon, may mga nagbubulung-bulungan sa isang silid at hinihimay ang aking mga sinasabi; naghahanap ng butas na ipambabatikos bukas. Sasabihin nila, “Salita lang ito, at hindi totoo ang tuwid na landas.” Sila rin po ang magsasabing hayaan na, magkaisa na; forgive and forget na lang para makausad na tayo.
Hindi ko po matatanggap ito. Forgive and forget na lang ang 10 taon na nawala sa atin? Forgive and forget na lang para sa magsasakang nabaon sa utang dahil sa kakaangkat natin ng bigas, gayong puwede naman palang pagyamanin ang ating sariling lupa?
Forgive and forget na lang ba para sa pamilya ng isang pulis na namatay nang walang kalaban-laban, dahil batuta lang ang hawak niya habang hinahabol ang armadong masasamang-loob?
Forgive and forget na lang ba para sa mga naulila ng 57 biktima ng masaker sa Maguindanao? Maibabalik ba sila ng “forgive and forget?” [Applause] Forgive and forget ang lahat ng atraso ng mga naglubog sa atin sa bulok na estado? Forgive and forget para maibalik ang lumang status quo? Ang tugon ko, “Ang magpatawad, maaari; ang makalimot, hindi.” [Applause] Kung ang nagkasala ay hindi mananagot, gagarantiyahan mo ang pagpapahirap muli sa sambayanan.
Ang tunay na pagkakaisa at pagkakasunduan ay magmumula lamang sa tunay at ganap na katarungan. Katarungan ang tawag sa plunder case na isinampa laban sa dating pangulo. [Applause] Katarungan na bigyan siya ng pagkakataong harapin ang mga akusasyon at ipagtanggol ang kanyang sarili. Katarungan ang nasaksihan natin noong 29 ng Mayo. Noong araw na iyon, pinatunayan natin: Posibleng mangibabaw ang katarungan kahit na ang kabangga mo ay may mataas na katungkulan. [Applause] Noong araw na iyon, may isang Delsa Flores sa Panabo, Davao del Norte, na nagsabing, “Posible palang iisang batas lang ang kailangang sundin ng court interpreter na tulad ko, at ng Punong Mahistrado.” [Applause]  Posible palang maging patas ang timbangan; maaaring isakdal at panagutin maski ang mayaman at makapangyarihan.
Kaya po sa susunod na magiging Punong Mahistrado, malaki ang inaasahan sa inyo ng sambayanan. Napatunayan na po nating posible ang imposible; ang trabaho natin ngayon, siguruhing magpapatuloy ang pagbabago tungo sa tunay na katarungan, matapos man ang ating termino. [Applause] Marami pong sira sa sistemang kailangan ninyong kumpunihin, at alam kong hindi magiging madali ito. Alam ko po kung gaano kabigat ang pasanin ng isang malinaw na mandato; ngunit ito ang atas sa atin ng taumbayan; ito ang tungkuling ating sinumpaan; ito ang kailangan nating gampanan.
Simple lang ang hangad natin: Kung inosente ka, buong-loob kang haharap sa korte, dahil kampante kang mapapawalang-sala ka. Kung ikaw ang salarin, anuman ang apelyido mo, o gaano man karami ang titulong nakakabit sa iyong pangalan, may katiyakan din na pananagutan mo ang ginawa mong kasalanan. [Applause]
Salamat din po kay Ombudsman Conchita Carpio-Morales, [applause] sa pagtanggap ng hamon na maging tunay na tanod-bayan. Kung tutuusin, puwede na niyang tanggihan ang responsibilidad at sabihing, “Retirado na ako, puwede bang ‘yung iba na lang?” Subalit nangibabaw ang kaniyang malasakit sa bayan. Sa kabila nito, may nagregalo pa rin sa kanya ng granada sa bahay. [Laughter] Ma’am, may mga darating pa pong pagsubok; baka po paglaon, magaya na kayo sa akin na tinatawag, sabay-sabay pang tinatawag, na ganid na kapitalistang kakuntsaba o komunista din patungong diktador dahil sa masigasig na mga repormang ipinapatupad natin.
Bilib po ako sa inyong pagpapakitang-gilas at maraming salamat sa pagiging instrumento ng katarungan, lalo na noong kasagsagan ng impeachment trial. [Applause] Salamat din po sa dalawang institusyong bumubuo ng Kongreso: Sa Senado at Kamara de Representante, na tinimbang ng taumbayan at nakitang sapat na sapat.
Sa lahat po ng tumulong sa pagpapagana ng mga prosesong pangkatarungan: Dumaan kayo sa matinding pagsubok, batikos, at agam-agam; kasama pa ang kaba na kung natalo kayo, kayo ang unang pupuntiryahin ng kalaban. Pero di kayo natinag. Umasa sa inyo ang Pilipino, at pinatunayan ninyong tama ang pag-asa sa inyo. Hindi ninyo binigo ang sambayanan; pinaliwanag ninyo lalo ang ating kinabukasan. [Applause]
Paalala lang po: Hindi natatapos ang laban sa isang tiwaling opisyal na natanggal sa puwesto, sa isang maanomalyang kontratang napigil ipatupad, o sa isang opisinang naituwid ang pamamalakad. Kaya naman nananawagan po tayo sa Kongreso na ipasa ang panukala nating sa pag-amyenda sa Anti-Money Laundering Act, upang mas mapaigting pa natin ang pagpapanagot sa mga tiwali.
Itong tinatamasa natin ngayon: ang bawat nailawan at iilawan pang sitio; ang bawat daan, tulay, paliparan, tren, at daungan; ang bawat kontratang walang bukol; ang kaligtasan at kapayapaan mula lungsod hanggang nayon; ang pagbalik ng piring sa sistemang pangkatarungan; ang bawat classroom, upuan, at aklat na napasakamay ng kabataan; ang bawat Pilipinong nahahandugan ng bagong kinabukasan—ang lahat ng ito, naabot natin sa loob lamang ng dalawang taon.
Pagtabihin po natin ang dalawang taon na ito, at ang nakaraang siyam at kalahating taon na ating pinagdusahan. Di po ba’t sumusulong na ang agenda ng pagbabago? Ang kapareho namin ng adhikain, malamang, kasama namin sa agendang ito. At kung kontra ka sa amin, siguro kontra ka rin sa ginagawa namin. Kung kumukontra sila sa agenda ng pagbabago, masasabi ba niyang sila’y nasa panig ninyo?
Paparating na naman po ang halalan. Kayo po, ang aming mga boss, ang tangi naming susundan. Ang tanong ko sa inyo, “Boss, saan tayo tatahak? Tuloy ba ang biyahe natin sa tuwid na landas, o magmamaneobra ba tayo paatras, pabalik sa daan na baluktot at walang patutunguhan?”
Naalala ko pa po noong nagsimula tayo. Mulat na mulat ako sa bigat ng pasaning sasalubong sa atin. Kabilang ako sa mga nag-isip: Kaya pa bang ituwid ang ganito kabaluktot na sistema?
Heto po ang aking natutuhan sa 25 buwan ng pagkapinuno: Walang pong imposible. [Applause] Walang imposible dahil kung nakikita ng taumbayan na sila ang tanging boss ng kanilang pamahalaan, bubuhatin ka nila, gagabayan ka nila, sila mismo ang mamumuno tungo sa makabuluhang pagbabago. Hindi imposible na ang Pilipinas ang maging kauna-unahang bansa sa Timog-Silangang Asya na magbibigay at nagbibigay ng libreng bakuna laban sa rotavirus. Hindi imposible para sa Pilipinas na tumindig at sabihing, “Ang Pilipinas ay sa Pilipino—at handa kaming ipagtanggol ito.” Hindi imposible na ang Pilipinong kay tagal nang yumuyuko tuwing may nakakasalubong na dayuhan—ang Pilipino ngayon, taas-noong tinitingala ng buong mundo. [Applause] Talaga naman pong ang sarap maging Pilipino sa mga panahong ito.
Noon pong nakaraang taon, hiniling ko sa taumbayan, magpasalamat sa mga nakikiambag sa positibong pagbabago sa lipunan. Hindi po biro ang mga pagsubok na dinaanan natin, kaya angkop lamang na pasalamatan ang mga taong nakibalikat, sa pagkukumpuni sa mga maling idinulot ng masamang pamamahala.
Sa lahat ng miyembro ng aking Gabinete: Maraming, maraming salamat. [Applause] Mapalad po ang sambayanan at may mga tulad ninyong handang isuko ang pribado at mas tahimik na pamumuhay para maghatid ng serbisyo-publiko, kahit pa batid ninyong ang kapalit nito ay mas maliit na sweldo, panganib, at pambabatikos. Kaya maraming salamat muli.
Huwag din po sana nilang masamain dahil personal ko silang pangangalanan: Kina Father Catalino Arevalo at Sister Agnes Guillen, na dumidilig at nagpapalago sa aking buhay spirituwal, lalo na sa mga panahong sukdulan ang pagsubok sa amin, maraming, maraming salamat din po. [Applause]
Ito po ang aking ikatlong SONA, tatlo na lamang din po ang natitira. Papasok na po tayo sa kalagitnaan ng ating liderato. Noong nakaraang taon, ang hamon ko sa inyo: Iwaksi ang kultura ng negatibismo; sa bawat pagkakataon, iangat ang kapwa-Pilipino.
Batid po sa tinatamasa natin ngayon: Hindi kayo nabigo. Sa inyo nagmula ang pagbabago. Ang sabi ninyo: Posible.
Humaharap po ako sa inyo bilang mukha ng isang gobyernong kayo ang boss at kayo pa rin ang lakas. Inuulat ko lamang ang mga pagbabagong ginawa ninyong posible.
Kaya nga po sa lahat ng nurse, midwife, o doktor na piniling magsilbi sa mga baryo; sa bawat bagong graduate na piniling magtrabaho sa gobyerno; sa bawat atletang Pilipinong bitbit ang watawat saan mang panig ng mundo; sa bawat kawani ng pamahalaan na tapat na nagseserbisyo: Kayo po ang gumawa ng pagbabago. [Applause]
Sa tuwing haharap ako sa isang ina na nagsasabing, “Salamat at nabakunahan na ang aking sanggol,” ang tugon ko: “Ikaw ang gumawa nito.”
Sa tuwing haharap ako sa isang bata na nagsasabing, “Salamat sa papel at lapis, sa pagkakataong makapag-aral,” ang tugon ko: “Kasama ka sa gumawa nito.”
Sa tuwing haharap ako sa isang OFW na nagsasabing, “Salamat at puwede ko na muling pangaraping tumanda sa Pilipinas,” ang tugon ko: “Ikaw ang gumawa nito.”
Sa tuwing haharap ako sa isang Pilipinong nagsasabing, “Salamat, akala ko hindi na magkakakuryente sa aming sitio. Akala ko hindi ko na aabuting buhay ang liwanag na ganito,” ang tugon ko: “Ikaw ang gumawa nito.”
Sa bawat pagkakataon na haharap ako sa isang magsasaka, guro, piloto, inhinyero, tsuper, ahente sa call center, karaniwang Pilipino; sa bawat Juan at Juana dela Cruz na nagsasabing “Salamat sa pagbabago,” ang tugon ko sa inyo: “Kayo ang gumawa nito.” [Applause]
Inuulit ko po, posible na ang dating imposible. Humaharap po ako sa inyo ngayon, at sinasabing, “Hindi ko SONA ito. Kayo ang gumawa nito. SONA ito ng sambayanang Pilipino.” Maraming, maraming salamat po at magandang hapon po sa lahat. [Applause]

State of the Nation Address
of
His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III
President of the Philippines
To the Congress of the Philippines
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 22, 2013]
Marami pong salamat. Maupo ho tayong lahat.
Bise Presidente Jejomar Binay; Senate President Franklin M. Drilon; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr.; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno at ang ating mga kagalang-galang na mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga miyembro ng Senado at Kamara de Representante; mga opisyal ng lokal na pamahalaan; mga miyembro ng Gabinete; mga unipormadong kasapi ng militar at kapulisan; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at sa aking mga Boss, ang mga minamahal kong kababayan:
Isang magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat. [Applause]
Ito po ang aking ikaapat na SONA; dalawa na lamang ang natitira. Halos apat na taon na nga po ang lumipas nang una akong nilapitan ng ilang kampo upang hikayating tumakbo sa pagkapangulo. Ang sabi nila: Alam naming hindi masosolusyunan sa isang tulog, sa isang taon, o kahit pa sa anim na taong termino ng isang Presidente ang lahat ng problema ng bansa. Pero simulan mo lang, at tiyak, kasama mo kaming mag-aaruga nito.
Noon pa man, mulat po ako sa tindi ng mga problemang aking kakaharapin. Mula sa pagiging kandidato, o Presidente na, o kahit ba matapos nang makababa sa puwesto, hindi biro ang peligrong kakambal ng trabahong ito. Malawakang transpormasyon ng lipunan ang aking hangarin, at mulat akong marami akong kailangang banggain para matupad ito. Pero hindi po ako pinalaki ng aking mga magulang para tumiklop lamang sa mga hamon. Hindi ko mahaharap ang aking sarili kung tinanggihan ko ang pagkakataong bawasan ang pagdurusang hindi naman dapat dinaraanan ng Pilipino. [Applause]
Tumugon nga po tayo sa panawagan, at ang mga kasama natin noong una, nadagdagan pa. Sa paniniwala ko nga po, kung tama ang aking ginagawa, lalo pang dadami ang ating magiging kasangga. Nito ngang nakaraang Mayo, tinanong ko kayo, “Boss, tama ba ang direksyon natin?” Ang tugon ninyo: “Tama, at pabilisin pa natin ang transpormasyon ng lipunan.” Humiling ako ng mga kakamping makikisagwan sa iisang direksyon, at ibinigay ninyo ito. Ang totoo nga po, hindi lang mayorya, hindi lang siyam sa labindalawa, kundi siyam sa sampung pinakamataas na puwesto na senador ay mga taong inilapit ko sa inyo. [Applause] Sa aking pakiwari, malinaw po ang mensahe nitong huling halalan: Tama, ituloy natin, damihan pa natin ang 8,581 na sitiong napailawan; dagdagan pa natin ang 28,398 na pamilyang dati’y informal settler, ngunit ngayon ay mayroon na o magkakaroon na ng disenteng tirahan; palaguin pa natin ang di bababa sa 40 bilyong piso kada taong dagdag ng perang napupunta sa edukasyon, kalusugan, serbisyong panlipunan, at marami pang iba, dahil sa tama at mas masugid na pagkolekta ng buwis; dama namin ang marami pang ibang patunay na talagang nagbabago ang lipunan. Lalo nga po akong nabuhayan sa ipinarating ninyong mensahe; malinaw po talagang hindi ako nag-iisa sa pagpasan ng mga responsibilidad. [Applause] Paano ba naman pong hindi lalakas ang aking loob, kung pati ang mga tulad ni Ginoong Niño Aguirre ay nakikihubog sa ating kinabukasan? Isipin po ninyo, hindi na nga makalakad dahil sa kapansanan, pilit pa rin niyang inakyat ang presintong nasa ikaapat na palapag ng gusali, para lang makaboto at makiambag sa tunay na pagbabago ng lipunan. Salamat, Ginoong Aguirre. [Applause]
Hindi nga po nauubos ang mga Pilipinong handang makiambag, na siyang ugat ng pagbabagong tinatamasa natin ngayon. Ang stratehiya: Sagarin ang oportunidad para sa lahat, lalo na para sa mga mas nangangailangan. Hindi natin pakay maghintay ng trickle down; hindi puwedeng baka sakali o tsamba lang silang daratnan ng mga biyaya ng kaunlaran. Ito pong tinatawag nating inclusive growth—itong malawakang kaunlaran—ang mismong prinsipyong bukal ng bawat inisyatiba, bawat kilos, bawat desisyon ng inyong gobyerno. Ang maiiwan na lamang ay ang ayaw sumama, dahil hindi sinamantala ang pagkakataon.
Ang atin pong batayang prinsipyo: Malawakang pagkakataon ang susi sa malawakan at pangmatagalang kaunlaran. Huwag po sana nating kalimutan na ang pagkakataon ay punla lamang. Kailangan itong diligin ng sipag, alagaan ng determinasyon, at payabungin ng dedikasyon. Tingnan nga lang po natin ang mga TESDA-DOLE [Technical Education and Skills Development Authority-Department of Labor and Employment] scholars. Sa 503,521 na napagtapos na natin dito, tinatayang anim sa bawat sampu ang nagtatrabaho na. [Applause] Noong araw po, ayon sa pag-aaral ng DBM [Department of Budget and Management] noong 2006 hanggang 2008, ang nakakahanap ng trabaho sa mga napagtapos ng TESDA: 28.5 percent lamang. Noong lumipas na taon naman po: sa IT-BPO [information technology-business process outsourcing] program, 70.9 percent ang employment rate ng ating mga nagtapos sa TESDA. Sa electronics and semiconductor program naman, umabot sa 85 percent na mga nagtapos noong 2012 ang nagkatrabaho. Malinaw po: Kayo mismo ang huhubog, kayo mismo ang magdidikta kung hinog at matamis ang bungang kolektibo nating pipitasin, o kung magiging bulok at katiting ang kahihinatnan ng mga pagkakataong bumubukas sa kabanatang ito ng ating kasaysayan.
Isa-isahin po natin. Ang layuning palawakin ang saklaw ng Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program: natupad. Ang dinatnan nating mahigit 700,000 kabahayang benepisyaryo ng programa noong 2010, umabot na sa halos 4 milyon na kabahayan sa ating pong administrasyon. [Applause]
Mayroon pa po: Galing sa pag-aaral ng Philippine Institute for Development Studies, mas malaki ng tinatayang 40 porsyento ang sinasahod ng mga naka-graduate ng high school, kumpara sa mga elementarya lang ang tinapos. Di po ba makatuwirang sagarin na natin ang tulong na ibinibigay natin sa mga pamilya, upang makumpleto na ng mga batang benepisyaryo ang high school, at sa gayon ay maisagad na rin ang benepisyo ng programang ito? Kaya nga po, sa susunod na taon, magiging saklaw na ng programa ang mga pamilyang may kabataang abot sa 18 taong gulang, upang hanggang sa high school ay makapagtapos na sila. [Applause]
Sa edukasyon naman po: ang layunin nating itaas ang kalidad ng kaalamang natututuhan ng kabataan, upang matapos mag-aral ay mapanghawakan nila ang mga oportunidad na bumubukas sa ating lipunan: natupad po. Nabura na ang minana nating kakulangan sa libro at upuan, at kung magpapatuloy nga po ang pagpapakitang-gilas ni Kalihim Brother Armin Luistro, [Applause] pati po ang kakulangan sa silid-aralan ay mabubura na rin sa taong ito. Ang magandang balita pa: May kakayahan na tayong paghandaan ang magiging pangangailangan dahil sa K to 12 program. [Applause]
Hindi po biro ang dinatnang mga problema ni Brother Armin sa DepEd [Department of Education]. Isipin po ninyo, kada isang textbook, pinepresyuhan dati ng 58 pesos; nang siya na ang namumuno, bumaba ang presyo ng eksaktong libro sa 30 pesos. Paano po kaya kung dati pa nagbayad ng tamang halaga para sa mga aklat na ito? Kung natipid natin ang diperensyang 28 pesos, at may limang textbook ang bawat sa isang tinatayang 20.7 million na estudyante sa ating public school system, ang katumbas nito: halos 2.9 billion pesos. [Applause] Kaya po sana nitong pondohan ang plano nating pagpapaayos at rehabilitasyon ng nasa 9,502 na silid-aralan.
Kung nagkulang sa lakas ng loob si Brother Armin, puwede namang ipamana na lang sa susunod sa kanya ang kultura ng pagwawalang-bahala sa kanyang ahensya. Puwede naman din pong ipamana na lang ang mga backlog; ipasa na lang sa susunod ang lolobong pagkukulang dahil sa dumaraming mga enrolee kada taon. Pero itong si Brother Armin, imbes na makuntento, imbes na sabihing, “Puwede na ‘yan, tapos na ang trabaho ko,” gagawa pa siya ng mas maraming upuan at classroom, at bibili ng mas maraming libro, upang siguruhing pati ang para sa susunod na mga taon ay mapunuan na rin. [Applause]
Ang pagpapalakas naman sa sektor ng agrikultura: natupad din. Isipin po ninyo, ayon sa NFA [National Food Authority]: Noong 2010, nag-angkat ang bansa ng mahigit dalawang milyong metriko tonelada ng bigas. Noong 2011, bumaba ito sa 855,000 metric tons. Noong 2012: 500,000 metric tons na lang. At ngayong 2013: Ang pinakasagad na nating aangkatin, kasama na ang pribadong sektor, ay ang minimum access volume na 350,000 metric tons. [Applause] Nakapaloob na po dito ang 187,000 metric tons sa reserbang buffer stock sakaling magsunud-sunod ang bagyo; malamang, dahil on-target pa rin tayo sa rice self-sufficiency, hindi na rin kailangan pang mag-angkat ng pribadong sektor. Dagdag pa po diyan, nagsimula na tayong mag-export ng matataas na uri ng bigas. Ang layo na po talaga natin doon sa panahong sinasabing hindi raw natin kayang pakainin ang ating sarili. [Applause]
Datos na rin po ang pruweba: Lumago ng 3.3 percent ang sektor na ito sa unang tatlong buwan ng 2013. Triple po ang itinaas nito mula sa 1.1 percent growth noong parehong panahon ng 2012. Kaya naman, patuloy po tayong nagpupunla ng mga inisyatibang pihadong magbubunga ng higit na kaunlaran sa ating mga magsasaka.
Halimbawa po, sa niyog. Ayon sa pagsusuri noong 2009, isa sa mga pinakamahirap na sektor sa bansa ang coconut farmers. Ang proseso ng pagsasaka nito: Pagkatanim, pitong taong hihintaying mamunga ang niyog, pero pagkatapos, dalawang henerasyon ang wala nang ibang kailangang gawin kundi mamitas na lang nang mamitas. May potensyal po tayong palakihin ang kita ng sektor na ito kung maglalatag tayo ng kulturang mas nang-eengganyo ng sipag at pagiging produktibo. Ang tugon: intercropping.
Tutulong ang gobyernong magpalakas sa iyong niyugan, kapalit ng obligasyong magpunla ng iba’t ibang binhi sa pagitan ng mga hilera ng niyog. Mas dadalas ang ani ng magsasaka, at depende sa kanilang itatanim, lalaki ang kanilang kita. Kung sa niyog lang, sa bawat ektarya, nasa 20,000 piso po kada taon ang kinikita ng magsasaka. Kung dadagdagan ito ng kape, maaaring pumalo ng 172,400 pesos ang kita; kung saging, aabot sa 102,325 pesos ang maaaring kitain, samantalang 89,000 pesos naman sa cacao. Ang laking diperensya, di po ba?
Nasimulan na po nating ilatag ang mga inisyatiba para rito: Nitong 2012, umabot na sa 5,500 hectares ng lupain ang ginagamit natin para sa intercropping sa 90 lokasyon sa bansa. Saklaw po nito ang 10,000 sa ating mga magsasaka. Ang target naman natin ngayong 2013: dagdag pang 434 sites para sa coconut intercropping. [Applause]
Itinitimon na rin po natin tungo sa mas produktibong pampang ang ating mga mangingisda. Isipin po ninyo: Pumalo sa 193.65 billion pesos ang ambag ng industriya ng pangingisda sa ating ekonomiya nitong 2012, pero sa kabila nito, 41 porsyento pa rin sa ating mga mangingisda ang maralita nang huli itong sukatin noong 2009. Sila ang nanghuhuli ng isda, pero ang natitira para sa kanilang pamilya, tinik na lang.
Kaya nga po: Nariyan ang maraming inisyatiba ng pamahalaan upang tulungang makaalpas sa lambat ng kahirapan ang ating mga mangingisda. Halimbawa nga po ang para sa Bataraza sa lalawigan ng Palawan. Sagana ang katubigan sa paligid nito. Pero dahil hindi mapaabot sa mga merkado nang sariwa ang isda, ginagawa na lamang itong tuyo. Sayang naman po, kasi sa bawat tatlong kilo ng lapu-lapu, isang kilo lang ang tuyong nagagawa. Paano kung mapahaba ang pagkasariwa ng isda dahil sa cold storage facility? Pupunta ka sa merkado nang sagad pa rin ang presyo ng huli mo. Parehong sikap sa paghuli, pero ang makukuha mo, tamang halaga. Kaya nga po, kasado na ang cold storage facility para sa Bataraza. [Applause] Kasabay po nito, nagtatayo na rin tayo ng mga bagong pantalan sa mga stratehikong lugar upang mapalago pa ang produksyon at kita. Ipinapaayos natin ang mga kalsada, tulay, at iba pang imprastruktura, pati na ang serbisyo para sa ating mga mangingisda.
Mahigpit din pong binabantayan ng DILG [Department of the Interior and Local Government], BFAR [Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources], at Coast Guard ang pangingisda nang walang habas; ang hiling ko nga pong ambag sa ating mga mangingisda: Pagpahingahin natin ang mga dagat. Hinihikayat ko po kayong sumama sa pangangalaga ng inyong kabuhayan; nakikita naman po ninyo: Ang oportunidad, inilalapit na sa inyo ng estado, pero ang resulta, syempre, nasa kamay ninyo.
Kung may isa man pong paksang paboritong ikabit sa pangalan ko, ito ay ang Hacienda Luisita. Nais ko lang pong iulat na noong Pebrero, alinsunod sa utos ng Korte Suprema, nakumpleto na ng Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) ang listahan ng mga kuwalipikadong benepisyaryo na mabibigyan ng lupa sa Luisita. [Applause] Ayon rin po kay Kalihim Gil de los Reyes, sinimulan na noong nakalipas na linggo ang pagtutukoy ng bawat loteng makukuha ng mga benepisyaryo, at magsisimula nang ipagkaloob ang mga titulo sa Setyembre nitong taong ito. [Applause]
Para naman po sa iba pang malalawak na lupain: Matagal na nating inatasan ang DAR, DENR [Department of Environment and Natural Resources], LRA [Land Registration Authority], at Land Bank na bumuo ng balangkas kung paanong mapapabilis ang pagproseso sa pagbabahagi ng lupain. Ipapaalala ko lang po: Tamang datos ang unang hakbang sa maayos na implementasyon ng CARPER. Pero nagmana po tayo ng isang depektibong land records system. Kaya simula pa lang po, nagtrabaho na ang DOJ [Department of Justice], LRA, DENR, at DAR para ayusin ang sistemang ito, at nasa punto na tayo ngayon kung kailan kaya nating siguruhin: Sa susunod na taon, naihain na ang lahat ng mga notice of coverage para sa mga lupaing saklaw ng komprehensibong repormang agraryo. [Applause]
Malinaw po: Ang estado, itinayo para paglingkuran kayo. Kung may problema sa kalusugan, dapat kumakalinga ang gobyerno; sa panahon ng sakuna, nariyan din dapat ito para magbigay-lingap. Ano po ba ang ginagawa natin sa mga larangang ito?
Sa kalusugan, ang layunin nating masaklaw ng PhilHealth ang mas marami pa nating kababayan: natupad na rin po. Dumating tayong 62 percent ng Pilipino ang naka-enrol sa programa; ngayon, nasa 81 percent na ito. Ang natitira nga pong wala sa talaan ay ang mga hinahanap pa, kabilang na po ang informal sector at mga katutubo. Inaasahan po natin ang pakikipagtulungan ng mga lokal na pamahalaan upang maisali na natin sa sistema ang lahat ng ating mamamayan. [Applause]
Hindi lang po mga enrolee ng PhilHealth ang lumalawak, kundi pati ang mga benepisyong maaaring makuha mula rito. Noong nakaraang taon, inilunsad natin ang Z Benefit Package. At nitong Pebrero naman po, pinalawak pa ito ng Expanded Z Benefit Package. Mas mahaba na po ang listahan ng mga karamdamang libreng maipapagamot ng mahihirap nating kababayan sa mga pampublikong ospital. Noong isang taon, nakasama na ang breast cancer, prostate cancer, at acute leukemia; ngayon, kasama na rin ang iba pang sakit tulad ng coronary bypass, at ng pagtatama ng mga butas at maling posisyon ng mga ugat sa puso.
Masasayang lang po ang ganitong benepisyo kung naghihingalo naman ang kalagayan ng ating mga pagamutan, at kung hindi naman ito mapuntahan ng mga nasa kanayunan. Kaya nga po todo buhos tayo ng budget sa imprastrukturang pangkalusugan: Nitong nakaraang tatlong taon, umabot sa 33 bilyong piso ang nailaan natin para sa pagpapatayo, pagpapaunlad, at rehabilitasyon ng 4,518 na ospital, rural health units, at barangay health stations sa buong bansa. [Applause] Halimbawa na po rito ang Region I Medical Center sa Dagupan, na nakapagsagawa na ng limang kidney transplant ngayong taon; ang Bicol Regional Teaching and Training Hospital sa Legazpi, Vicente Sotto Medical Center sa Cebu, at Northern Mindanao Medical Center sa Cagayan de Oro, na ayon kay Secretary Ike Ona ay may kakayahan na ngayong magsagawa ng open heart surgery dahil sa mga bagong pasilidad at kagamitan. [Applause] Nariyan din po ang Davao Regional Hospital sa Tagum City—ang una nating cancer center sa labas ng Kamaynilaan.
Para naman po sa paghahanda sa kalamidad: Ang layunin nating magpanday ng mga mekanismo upang mailayo sa peligro ang Pilipino: natupad na rin po. Nariyan po ang epektibong serbisyong bunsod ng pagsasanib-puwersa ng Geohazard Mapping and Assessment Program at Project NOAH [Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards] naman ng DOST [Department of Science and Technology]. Nitong nakaraang taon, natapos na natin ang multihazard mapping ng dalawampu’t walong pinakapeligrosong lugar sa bansa. Susunod na po rito ang para sa Greater Metro Manila Area na target nating kumpletuhin pagdating ng 2014. Handa na rin po ang geohazard maps para sa 496 na lungsod at munisipyo. Ang natitira pong 1,138 na sasaklaw sa bawat sulok ng bansa ay makukumpleto bago matapos ang 2015. Dagdag pa po, mas matalas at detalyado na ang mga mapa, kaya mas eksakto na ring natutukoy ang mga mapanganib na lugar. [Applause]
Buhat naman ng inilunsad ang Project NOAH noong nakaraang taon, nakapag-deploy na tayo ng 525 automated water level monitoring stations at automated rain gauges sa 18 major river basins sa atin pong bansa. Tuloy-tuloy din ang pamamahagi natin ng mga modernong kagamitan tulad ng Doppler radars, tsunami detectors, at alerting sirens.
Subalit hindi po sapat ang basta pagbibigay lang ng makabagong gamit at teknolohiya. Sinasanay din natin ang mga makakatanggap nito kung paanong intindihin, gamitin, at palaganapin ang impormasyon. Kapag masama ang panahon, hindi na lamang bilis ng hangin ang kanilang basehan; alam na rin nila kung gaano karaming tubig ang bubuhos, at nakakapagbigay sila ng tama at napapanahong babala sa komunidad upang makapaghanda.
Inaayos na rin po natin ang problema sa madalas na pagbaha sa Kamaynilaan. Biruin po ninyo: Noong Ondoy, tinatayang 3,600 cubic meters per second ang tubig na dumaloy mula sa Sierra Madre. Pero ang kapasidad ng dadaanan nito, nasa tinatayang 1,000 cubic meters per second lang. Saan naman po pupunta ang diperensyang 2,600 cubic meters kada segundo? Ito po ang bugso ng tubig na nagpapaapaw sa mga mababang lugar at nagiging baha.
Di po ba’t narinig na ng marami sa atin: “Waterways are inalienable.” Ibig sabihin: Ang daanan ng tubig, para sa tubig lang. Ang problema nga po, kulang na nga ang dadaanan ng tubig, may mga gusali pang naghahadlang sa mga estero, at binabarahan pa ito ng basura ng mga tumitira sa paligid. Para po solusyunan ito, nakikipag-ugnayan tayo sa mga LGU [local government unit] upang maayos na mailipat ang mga informal settlers. Inihahanda na rin po ng legal team sa pamumuno ni Secretary Leila de Lima ang mga kaso laban sa nagtayo ng mga gusali na sumara o humaharang sa mga daanan ng tubig. [Applause]
Hindi po tayo makukuntento sa sisihan. Ang ating pong aksyon: 6.2 billion pesos para maiwasan ang pagbaha sa Kamaynilaan. Bahagi nito ang pagtatayo sa Blumentritt Interceptor Catchment area; 3.3 kilometers po ang haba ng buong proyekto, at oras na makumpleto, kaya nitong sumalo ng tubig na katumbas ng tinatayang 14 na Olympic-size swimming pool. Kaya kung may bubuhos man pong tubig, mayroon na itong pupuntahan, at hindi na kailangang nasa ibabaw ng lansangan. [Applause] Nasimulan na po ang proyektong ito noong Marso; layunin nating matapos ito sa susunod na taon.
Ginagampanan po ng gobyerno ang kanyang obligasyon. Tanungin din po sana natin ang ating sarili: Ano ang inaambag ko sa solusyon? Kung may magtapon sa ilog, sitahin mo sana; kung may magtayo ng building sa estero, isumbong mo na. Lalo po tayong malulubog sa problema kung magkikibit-balikat lang po tayo.
Lumisan man ang bagyo, di naman humuhupa ang pagsisikap nating maibalik sa normal ang buhay ng mga pamilyang nasalanta ng mga nagdaang kalamidad. Sa pagtutulungan ng gobyerno at pribadong sektor, nasa 9,377 na kabahayan na po ang naipatayo para sa mga sinalanta ng bagyong Sendong. May karagdagan pang 4,374 na tahanang maipapatayo ng gobyerno bago matapos ang susunod na taon. [Applause] Humihingi po tayo ng pag-unawa kung medyo nagtagal ito, dahil na rin sa masalimuot na proseso ng land acquisition; katunayan nga po, kung maaayos ang usapin sa iba pang lupain, may dagdag pang 2,719 na kabahayan ang maipapatayo natin.
Target naman po nating maipagkaloob ang kabuuang 53,106 na kabahayan para sa mga kababayan nating sinalanta ng bagyong Pablo. Nasimulan na po natin ang pamamahagi ng mga bagong bahay nitong Mayo. Tatapusin po natin ang 17,609 na kabahayan bago matapos ang taon, at oras na makumpleto na rin ang natitira pang 35,447 sa 2014, ang mga pamilyang tinamaan ng dahas ng kalikasan ay makakasilong na muli sa ilalim ng sariling bubong. [Applause]
Tungkol din po sa pabahay, para naman sa ating unipormadong hanay: Ang 21,800 na housing unit para sa pulis at kasundaluhan—natupad na, noong isang taon pa. Sa Phase II naman ng proyekto, naitayo na rin po ang halos 26,050 sa target na 31,200, na makukumpleto na sa susunod na buwan para naman sa Phase II.
Bukod sa pabahay, may mga programang pangkabuhayan din tayong binubuo para sa ating mga kawal. Ang ilang libong ektaryang lupain sa tatlong kampo-militar—partikular na sa Fort Magsaysay sa Nueva Ecija, sa Camp Kibaritan sa Bukidnon, at sa Camp Peralta sa Capiz—ay paglulunsaran ng dagdag na pagkakakitaan ng mga sundalo, gaya ng plantasyon ng kawayan, kape, cacao, at palm oil. [Applause] Kung dati, nakatutok lamang sa tanggulan ang mga kawal, ngayon maski retirado ay may pagkakataong maging bahagi ng paglago ng ating ekonomiya.
Subalit hindi dito nagtatapos ang paghahanap ng solusyon sa mga minana nating problema sa pambansang tanggulan. Isipin po ninyo: noong 1986, mayroon daw tayong 250,000 na pulis at sundalo para sa mahigit 55 million Filipinos. Ngayon po, mayroon pa rin tayong tinatayang 250,000 na pulis at sundalo, na nagbabantay sa 95 milyong Pilipino. Halos dumoble ang populasyon natin, pero hindi nagbago ang bilang ng nagbabantay sa atin.
Tiyak pong may mga nagsasabi na diyan: “Problema ba ito? E di magdagdag kayo ng pulis at sundalo. Makakalikha pa kayo ng trabaho.” Sana nga po ganyan lang kadali at kasimple ang solusyon. Tingnan po muna natin: Sa karaniwang pension scheme, maghuhulog ng kontribusyon ang miyembro at nag-eempleyo. Ito ang puhunang palalaguin, at dito magmumula ang pensyon sa pagreretiro ng miyembro. Pero ano po ba ang situwasyon sa pensyon ng AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] at PNP [Philippine National Police]? Walang naghuhulog, pero may kailangang bayaran. Dagdag pa rito, naka-index sa sahod ng mga aktibong sundalo at pulis ang pensyon ng retirado. Ibig sabihin, kapag lumaki ang sahod ng nasa serbisyo, lalaki rin ang pensyon ng mga retirado o ng mga pamilyang tumatanggap pa nito. Taun-taon, dumarami ang mga nagreretiro, kaya natural, pataas din nang pataas ang obligasyon. Ang masaklap, pambansang budget ang sumasalo nito: Noong 2012, 54.48 billion pesos ang inilaan para sa pensyon ng sundalo at kapulisan. Ngayong taon, 61.29 billion, at aabot po ito sa 80.64 billion sa 2016. Lolobo pa ito nang lolobo, kaya’t liliit naman nang liliit ang pondo para sa iba pang serbisyong panlipunan. Paano naman po tayo magdadagdag pa ng pulis at sundalo kung ganito ang konteksto?
Kailangan ng sistemang tutugon sa obligasyon ng lipunan sa ating mga sundalo’t kapulisan; malamang po, GSIS [Government Service Insurance System] ang hihilingan natin ng tulong para rito. Pinag-aaralan na rin po ang posibilidad na gamitin ang mga reclaimed area para makalakap ng pondong ipapasok sa papandaying solusyon. Hindi rin naman po natin puwedeng biglain ang pagtugon sa kabuuan ng ating mga pangangailangan, kaya’t mas masinsin pang pagsusuri ang gagawin natin upang makalikha ng isang patas, pangmatagalan, at malinaw na mekanismo para sa mga pensyon ng mga pulis at sundalo. Nananawagan po ako sa Kongreso: Pag-aralan po nating muli ang PD 1638 at RA 8551 upang maiangkop sa panahon at sa pambansang pangangailangan ang pensyon at benepisyo ng ating pulis at kasundaluhan. [Applause]
Kaparehong paninindigan rin po ang nakikita nating solusyon sa nakaambang problema sa pensyon sa SSS [Social Security System]. Isipin po ninyo: mula 1980, 21 times nang nagkaroon ng across-the-board pension increase—ulitin ko lang po yun, 21 times—pero ang masaklap po, dalawang beses pa lang pong tumaas ang contribution rate. Ang resulta: Tinatayang 1.1 trillion pesos na ang unfunded liability ng SSS base sa pag-aaral na isinagawa nitong 2011. Inaasahang tataas ito ng 8 porsyento kada taon, at mauubos ang pondo 28 years from now. Kapag nangyari ito, walang ibang malulugi kundi ang susunod na salinlahi ng Pilipino.
Naniniwala po tayong panahon na para amyendahan ang SSS Pension Scheme. Kailangan nating tambalan ng inisyatibang mag-impok nang sapat ang pagluluwal natin ng pera. Kung magdadagdag lamang tayo ng 0.6 percent sa contribution rate, 141 billion pesos na agad ang maibabawas sa unfunded liability ng SSS. Kung ngayon na tayo magsisimulang mamuhunan sa kinabukasan, wala nang problemang ipapamana sa mga susunod sa atin. [Applause]
Sa kapulisan naman po, ang layunin nating magbigay ng lakas upang magampanan nila ang kanilang tungkulin: natupad rin natin. Simula ngayong 2013, 30,000 sa mga pulis ang babalik sa pagpupulis, dahil kukuha tayo ng mga civilian personnel para gawin ang mga tungkuling administratibo. Sayang naman po ang kakayahan at abilidad ng ating mga kawal at pulis kung ikukulong lamang natin sila sa apat na sulok ng opisina.
Sa pagpasok rin po ng buwang ito, inumpisahan nang ipamahagi ang mga bagong unit ng 9mm Glock 17 pistols sa ating mga pulis. Simula pa lang po ito; kasado na rin ang pamamahagi ng kabuuang 74,879 na baril sa ating mga alagad ng batas, tungo sa katuparan ng mithiin nating one-is-to-one police-to-pistol ratio. [Applause]
Sulit na sulit naman po ang pamumuhunan nating ito sa pambansang kapulisan, lalo pa’t nagbubunsod ito sa maayos at maaasahang serbisyo. Di po ba’t tuwing eleksyon, nasanay na tayo sa kaliwa’t kanang insidente ng karahasan? Tinugunan po natin ito, tulad ng Oplan Katok. Ang pakay ng programa: hanapin ang mga baril na paso na ang lisensya, at tiyakin na ang mga mayroon lamang lisensya ay hawak pa rin ng otorisadong mamamayan. Para gawin ito, 491,929 na pintuan ang kinatok ng ating mga pulis para sa renewal ng mga lisensya. Nakatulong po ito upang maging mas epektibo ang kampanya natin para sa Secure and Fair Elections, kung saan ang 112 private armed groups noong eleksyon ng 2010 ay napababa na lang sa 41. Katumbas po ito ng 63 percent na pagbaba. [Applause] Mula rin sa 189 na insidente ng karahasan noong eleksyon ng 2010, 77 na insidente lamang ang kompirmadong naganap nitong huling halalan. [Applause]
Gawin po nating halimbawa ang ARMM [Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]. Ang sabi nga po ni Governor Mujiv Hataman, sa tanang-buhay niya, hindi siya makaalala ng pagkakataon kung kailan walang failure of elections sa Lanao del Sur. Alalahanin po natin, ito ang unang beses na magkasabay ang pambansa at rehiyonal na halalan sa ARMM. Ang ibig pong sabihin, noon ay nakatutok ang buong pwersa ng estado sa iisang rehiyon, pero may failure of elections pa rin. Ngayong 2013, dahil buong bansa ang kinailangang tutukan, at lumawak ang kanilang responsibilidad, may mga nag-akalang lulubha pa ang sitwasyon sa halalan ng ARMM. Pero kita naman po ang laki ng ikinaganda nito: Naging malinis at tapat ang halalan sa ARMM; natuloy ang bilangan, natuloy ang proklamasyon ng mga may bagong mandato mula sa taumbayan. Dahil sa sipag ng ating mga pulis at kawal, at gayundin sa pakikiisa ng sambayanan, talaga naman pong ang eleksyon 2013 ay naging mas payapa at tahimik. [Applause]
Gayumpaman, may mga insidenteng nagmamantsa pa rin sa dangal ng ating kapulisan. Nabalitaan na naman siguro natin ang nangyari sa mga miyembro ng Ozamiz Gang na sina Ricky Cadavero at Wilfredo Panogalinga: nahuli na, pero napatay pa. Tulad ng ginawa nating imbestigasyon sa nangyari sa Atimonan, sisiguruhin nating mananagot ang sinumang pulis o kung sino mang sangkot dito—gaano man kataas ang kanilang ranggo. Kung sino man ang mga pasimuno dito: maghanda lang kayo. Malapit ko na kayong makilalang lahat. [Applause]
Sa kabila ng ganitong mga kuwento, buhay na buhay po ang aking pag-asa sa hanay ng kapulisan. Hindi sila nagkukulang sa mabubuting halimbawa tulad ni PO3 Edlyn Arbo, na buong tapang na hinarap at tinugis ang isang holdaper sa nasakyan niyang jeep, [applause] off-duty man at walang dalang baril. Nariyan po siya at sinagupa yung holdaper, na nagkamaling siya ang pag-tripan. Nariyan din po si PO3 Felipe Moncatar na umani ng samu’t saring papuri dahil sa haba ng listahan [applause] ng mga kriminal na kanyang nahuli, at ang balita ko ay may nahuli ka na namang batikang carnaper sa Bacolod—talagang napakahusay mo. Ang ilan po dito sa kanyang mga nahuli kabilang sa pinaka-pinaghahanap na personalidad sa Bacolod at miyembro ng mga malalaking sindikato. Baka narinig na rin po ninyo ang kwento ni PO2 Dondon Sultan. May nasiraan ng kotse sa kahabaan ng Quezon Boulevard; tigil naman si Ginoong Sultan para tumulong. Hindi lang po siya nagpalit ng gulong; inihatid pa niya sa kasa ang nasiraan. [Applause] Bilang pasasalamat sa kanyang serbisyo, sinubok abutan ng 1,000 piso si PO2 Sultan. Tinanggihan niya ito. Ang kanyang sagot: “Trabaho naming tumulong sa mamamayan.” [Applause] Saludo po kami sa mga tulad ninyong lingkod-bayan. Patunay kayong hindi pa endangered species ang tapat at mahuhusay na pulis. Inatasan ko na sina Kalihim Mar Roxas ng DILG [Department of the Interior and Local Government], pati na rin si Kalihim Voltaire Gazmin ng DND [Department of National Defense], upang siguruhing ang mga katulad ninyo sa ating unipormadong hanay ay makakatanggap ng kaukulang pabuya at karangalan. Salamat pong muli. [Applause]
Idaragdag ko na rin po ang ating disaster relief workers mula sa maraming sangay ng gobyerno, pati na ang volunteers galing sa pribadong sektor. Alam ko pong hindi madaling lumusong sa baha, magbungkal ng putik, at humarap sa mukha ng pinsala. Hindi po ako magsasawang kilalanin ang inambag ninyo sa lipunan; saludo po ako sa pag-aalay ninyo ng sarili upang bawasan ang pagdurusa ng ating mga kababayan. [Applause]
Abot-kamay na rin po ang kapayapaan sa rehiyong matagal nang pinupunit ng hidwaan. Nitong Oktubre po ng nakaraang taon, nilagdaan ang Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro. Katunayan nga po, siyam na araw pa lang ang nakakalipas mula nang lagdaan ang ikalawang annex ng kasunduan. Kumpiyansa po tayong masusundan pa ito ng mas magandang balita sa lalong madaling panahon.
Tiyak kong mulat ang lahat: Hindi biro ang proseso ng pagbubuo ng consensus; mabuti na lamang talaga at handang makinig, magbigayan, at magkita sa gitna ang magkabilang panig. Alam naman natin ang maaaring maging resulta kung magpapadaan tayo sa inip. Ang malinaw po sa akin: Ang mga salitang ating bibitawan ay dapat magbunga ng mga kilos na positibong makakaapekto sa lahat. Ang bawat linya sa binubuo nating kasunduan ay dapat maaaring itaga sa bato, at hindi ililista lamang sa tubig upang anurin na naman ng kasaysayan. [Applause] Pinalaki po ako ng aking ama nang may isang salita, kaya’t sinasabi ko sa mga kapatid nating kasapi ng Bangsamoro: Anumang mapagkasunduan natin ay ipatutupad ng pambansang gobyerno. [Applause]
Kailangan po ng tiwala sa usapan ng kapayapaan. Hindi automatic ang magkaroon ng tiwala, dahil na rin sa haba ng pinagdaanan. At ngayon, talagang dama na natin na gustong makipagkasundo ng magkabilang panig, at tayo naman ay nagpapakita na dapat talaga tayong pagkatiwalaan. At sa mga pumipigil sa pagkakaroon ng tiwala at naghahasik ng pagdududa: Masasabi mo bang Pilipino kang may malasakit sa kapwa mong Pilipino?
Umaasa po ako sa pakikiambag ng bawat Pilipino sa layunin natin para sa Bangsamoro. Ipakita po natin sa kanilang hindi sila nagkamali sa pagpili sa direksyon ng kapayapaan; ipamalas natin ang lakas ng buong bansa upang iangat ang mga probinsya sa Muslim Mindanao, na kabilang sa mga pinakamaralita nating mga lalawigan. [Applause] Tagumpay ng lahat ang ating hangarin; hindi tayo papayag na may kababayan tayong mapapag-iwanan habang may ibang nakakalamang. Nananawagan ako sa ating Kongreso: Nabuo na po ang Transition Commission na gagawa ng panukalang Bangsamoro Basic Law. Tatapusin ito alinsunod sa mga prinsipyo ng komprehensibong kasunduan para sa kapayapaan; maipasa po sana ninyo ito bago matapos ang 2014. [Applause] Sa gayong paraan, may sapat tayong panahon para makapaghanda sa paghalal ng bagong pamahalaang Bangsamoro sa 2016.
Anuman pong pagbabagong tinatamasa natin ngayon ay naabot dahil hindi tayo nakuntentong sumunod lamang sa dinatnang status quo ng pamamahala. Matanong ko nga po: Ilan po ba sa inyo ang nakagamit ng tinatawag na Telepono sa Barangay? Hindi po ako magtataka kung wala. Isipin po ninyo, ayon sa DOTC [Department of Transportation and Communications]: Mahigit 5 billion pesos ang ginastos para sa isang programang magdadala ng telepono sa mga kanayunan. Di po ba’t sayang lang ito, dahil sa loob ng maikling panahon matapos ang implementasyon, dahil hindi pa nga po tunay na tapos ang implementasyon niyan, dumami nang dumami ang may cellphone na Pilipino? Sino nga ba naman ang papansin sa mahigit 6,000 landline na ikinabit o ipinakabit nila, gayong may 100 milyon nang cellphone sa Pilipinas?
Heto pa po ang isang halimbawa ng pag-iisip sa gobyerno na kinailangan nating baguhin: Bumili tayo ng walong combat utility helicopter, para daw sa mabilisang pagbiyahe ng ating mga sundalo. Ang problema: Sukat ba naman pong naka-mount ang baril sa may pintuan, at kailangang tanggalin kung may dadaan. Kung lalapag ka habang nagbabakbakan, ano ang silbi ng machine gun na nakatabi at hindi mapaputok? Wala bang nakaisip nito bago nagkapirmahan ng kontrata? Bakit naman po pinayagang mangyari ito?
Kailangan pong maging mas mahusay tayong mamimili. Hindi puwedeng palagi tayong nakasalalay sa sales talk ng mga supplier sa pagpili ng mga kagamitan natin. Inatasan natin ang DOST na bumuo ng grupo ng mga ekspertong hindi kayang bolahin ng mga supplier, lalo na po pagdating sa mga big-ticket items. Ang patakaran natin: Tamang pagkilala sa ugat ng problema; tamang pag-aaral na tutukoy sa tamang solusyon, na maaabot naman sa pamamagitan ng tamang metodolohiya. [Applause]
Iyan po ang kaisipang pinagmulan ng ating tugon sa isyu ng mga informal settler sa Kamaynilaan. Kaya nga po, ang layunin nating ilayo sa panganib ang mga nagsisiksikan sa peligrosong bahagi ng lungsod: tinutupad na rin natin. Wala naman po sigurong kokontra kapag sinabi nating hindi tama ang kasalukuyan nilang kondisyon. Ayon po sa Article 2, Section 5, o ang general welfare clause ng ating Saligang Batas: “Dapat sundin ng Estado ang pagpapanatili ng kapayapaan at kaayusan, ang pangangalaga sa buhay, kalayaan at ari-arian, at ang pagtataguyod sa kagalingang panlahat upang matamasa ng buong sambayanan ang mga biyaya ng demokrasya.”
Dito po natin napatunayan: Nakikinig sa katuwiran ang Pilipino; kapag ipinakita mong malasakit ang iyong batayang prinsipyo, handa tayong makiisa. Bago po magbaklas ng mga bubong at magtibag ng mga pader, ipinaliwanag natin ang katuwiran ng ating desisyon: Maayos ang lilipatan, malapit sa sakayan, at kung magsisikap kayo, hindi magkukulang ang inyong pagkakakitaan. Nilinaw din po natin: Layunin nating magbigay-lingap sa mga nasa peligro—hindi sa sindikato. Batid nating sa tuwing inaabuso ng ilan ang pagmamalasakit ng estado, ipinapain rin nila sa alanganin ang buhay at kabuhayan ng napakaraming Pilipino.
Matapos nga pong maibiyahe ang isang pangkat sa relocation site, sila mismo ang nanghikayat sa mga dati nilang kapitbahay: Sumama na kayo. Mas ligtas dito. Ngayong taon po, prayoridad nating ilipat ang mahigit 19,400 pamilyang nagsisiksikan sa mga pangunahing daluyan ng tubig sa Metro Manila. Sa pagkakapit-bisig ng DILG, NHA [National Housing Authority], DSWD, MMDA [Metropolitan Manila Development Authority], at DPWH, lumilinaw na po ang sagot sa suliraning ito.
Isa pa pong halimbawa ng transpormasyon sa pamamahala: Di ba’t matagal ding nabinbin sa Kongreso ang mahahalagang batas? Nito pong nakaraang taon, naisabatas na, sa wakas, ang Sin Tax Reform Law at ang Responsible Parenthood Law. [Applause] Nagpapasalamat tayo sa mga naging kasangga natin sa pagsusulong nito sa Kamara at Senado. Hindi ninyo inalintana ang mahabang proseso ng debate at konsultasyon; hindi kayo nagpadaig sa mga naghasik ng pagdududa upang harangin ang ating mabuting agenda. Tinitimbang ninyo kung ano ang kapaki-pakinabang sa mas nakakarami, at isinusulong ang tunay na serbisyo para sa Pilipino. [Applause]
Ilalapit ko na rin po sa ating Kongreso ang ilang batas na makakatulong sa pagpapatuloy ng nasimulan nating pagbabago. Maamyendahan na po sana ang Cabotage Law, upang mas mapalakas ang kumpetisyon, at mapababa ang gastos sa transportasyon [applause] ng ating mga sakahan at industriya. Maisulong na rin po sana ang Fiscal Incentives Rationalization Bill, upang maging mas tapat, malinaw, at may pananagutan ang mga insentibong ibinigay natin sa mga negosyante. [Applause] Paglaanan din po sana ng panahon ang Land Administration Reform Bill, upang maitimon sa iisang direksyon ang mga kawanihang nakatutok sa ating mga lupain, at nang sa gayon ay masigurong masinop at epektibo nilang magagawa ang kanilang trabaho. [Applause]
Bukas na bukas din po, ihahain natin ang panukalang 2.268 trillion pesos na national budget sa Kongreso. Kumpiyansa po ako sa suporta at pakikibalikat ninyo upang mapatibay ang pondong ito na talaga naman pong masusing pinag-isipan. Makakatulong ito hindi lang para ituloy ang agenda ng positibong pagbabago, kundi upang mapaspas pa ang pag-arangkada natin tungo sa malawakang kaunlaran.
May ilan pong nagsasabi na kailangang patibayin ang Sandatahang Lakas. Sang-ayon po ako dito. Pero tila ba ang gusto nila ay ilagak ang bawat sentimo ng kabang bayan para sa fighter jets, tangke de guerra, at iba pang gamit pandigma. Hindi yata nila alam na ang isang fighter jet na nagkakahalaga ng 1.58 bilyong piso, ay katumbas ng 6,580 na bahay para sa mga pulis at sundalo, o halos 2,000 na silid-aralan para sa mga kabataan. At ano naman ang magagawa ng isang pirasong jet? Para maging epektibo, ang kailangan, mga squadron—at ang isa nito ay binubuo ng 24 na fighter jets. Sa halagang 1.58 billion pesos kada piraso, 37.92 billion pesos ang huhugutin sa kabang bayan para makabuo ng isang squadron. Paano naman ang missiles pati na rin ang practice missiles? Hindi rin po libre ang jet fuel, radar system, ground bases, at ground intercept controls. Hindi po talaga biro ang gastos para sa isang minimum credible defense posture; gagayahin pa ba natin ang iba, na handang kalimutan ang lahat para lang makuha ang nuclear option? Wala naman sigurong sasang-ayon dito. Babalansehin po natin ang ating mga pangangailangan. Aasikasuhin natin nang husto ang mga dapat tugunan sa ating lipunan, habang patuloy tayong nagiging mabuti at mahinahong kasapi ng pandaigdigang komunidad.
Alam naman natin dati, ang batayan ng desisyon, puro pulitika. Gagawin ang lahat para kumapit sa kapangyarihan, kapalit ang pagdurusa ng kasalukuyan at susunod na henerasyon ng Pilipino. Tingnan po natin kung ano ang kinahantungan ng pag-ipit sa pagtataas ng pasahe sa LRT at MRT. Ang tinatayang gastos sa bawat biyahe ng pasahero ng LRT, 40 piso. Ang bayad ng pasahero, 15 piso. Ibig sabihin, sagot ng pamahalaan ang natitirang 25 piso. Sa MRT po, 60 piso ang totoong gastos: 15 piso sa pasahero, 45 piso sa gobyerno—sa huli, bawat Pilipino, abunado. Nasa Mindanao ka o Visayas ka man, na ni minsan ay hindi nakatuntong sa LRT o MRT, kasama ka sa pumapasan nito.
Ang masaklap pa nga po: Dahil ipinamigay na ng nakaraang mga pinuno ang commercial development rights natin dito, bawat pisong maaaring makalap mula sa mga poster at billboard na nakapaskil sa stasyon o sa tren man, napupunta sa pribadong kumpanya kaysa sa gobyerno. Ang puwede sanang pagkunan ng pantustos sa maintenance at operasyon, nawala pa.
Siguro naman po, makatuwirang ilapit man lang natin sa ibinabayad sa aircon bus ang pasahe ng LRT at MRT, upang maituon ang subsidiya sa iba pang serbisyong panlipunan.
Nakita naman po ninyo: Wala tayong balak magpamana ng problema sa susunod sa atin. Ang totoo nga po, ang mga proyektong dati’y nilulumot lang, ngayon, napapakinabangan na ng mamamayan. Tingnan na lang natin ang Ternate-Nasugbu Road. Kung tutuusin, anim na kilometro lang ang haba ng kalsadang ito na nagkokonekta sa Cavite, Batangas, at Metro Manila, pero ‘yang anim na kilometrong iyan, inabot pa ng halos 20 taon bago ito matapos. Binuksan na natin ang isang bahagi nito, at pag nakumpleto ang natitirang slope protection, ganap na ang magiging pakinabang ng kalsada sa mga motorista.
Nariyan din po ang Aluling Bridge sa Ilocos Sur. Taong 1978 pa po inilatag sa papel ang pagpapatayo nito. Siniguro na nating hindi lamang din papel ang mamanahin ng susunod sa atin: Nitong Marso, sa wakas, natapos na ito at sinimulan na rin natin noong nakaraang buwan ang operasyon ng Laguindingan Airport, na isang henerasyon naman ang pagitan mula nang inisip at isakatuparan. [Applause]
Ilang dekada ring naghintay ang industriya ng semiconductors na magkaroon ng laboratoryong kayang makipagsabayan sa pasilidad ng ibang bansa. Hindi na po natin pinahaba ang kanilang paghihintay. Nitong nakaraang Mayo, sa pangunguna ng DOST, pinasinayaan natin ang Advanced Device and Materials Testing Laboratory. Dati, kailangan pang ipadala ang mga produkto sa ibang bansa para suriin. Hindi natin nasasagad ang kita; hindi rin nasasagad ang potensyal ng industriya na manghikayat ng puhunan. Dahil po sa pasilidad na ito na tinaguriang ADMATEL, ngayon, dito na susuriin ang mga produkto, at masusulit ang mga bentahe ng manggagawang Pilipino sa larangan ng electronics. Inaasahan nga po nating lalo pang lalakas ang industriyang nag-ambag ng halos 44 percent ng ating exports noong 2012. [Applause]
Sa tulong naman po ng ating Big Man sa Senado na si Manong Frank Drilon, [applause] natapos na ang mahigit 50 taon na paghihintay ng mga Ilonggo; nasimulan na ang Jalaur River Multipurpose Project II sa Iloilo. Ano po ba ang mga pakinabang nito?
Tinataya pong 24,000 magsasaka sa kalakhang Iloilo ang mahahatiran nito ng buong-taong irigasyon. Dahil dito, maaaring dumoble ang ani ng mga magsasaka ng palay. Linawin po natin: Ang sakop nitong 31,840 hectares ng lupaing mapapatubigan, may dagdag na aning bigas na 146,013 metric tons. Katumbas po ito ng halos 80 porsyento ng aangkatin nating buffer stock ng bigas para sa 2013. [Applause]
Bukod pa po ito sa iba pang benepisyo ng proyekto tulad ng pag-iwas sa malawakang baha sa Iloilo, at ang dagdag na 6.6 megawatts ng hydropower. May ambag din ito sa supply ng tubig para sa ilang bahagi ng probinsya, at sa industriya ng ecotourism doon. Dagdag pa rito, nasa 17,000 trabaho ang malilikha ng proyekto; oras na maging fully operational naman ito, tinatayang 32,000 Pilipino ang mabibiyayaan ng sapat na pagkakakitaan. [Applause] Una raw po inisip itong proyektong ito taong 1960. Nagsabay po kaming dumating sa mundong ito.
Mulat din po tayong marami sa ating mga kababayan ang nananabik na makita ang mga bunga ng ating Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects. Alam din po nating may mga tila naiinip na sa kahihintay para rito.
Isakonteksto po natin. Noong 2010, pag-upo natin sa puwesto, 6.5 percent na lang ng programmable budget ng taon, o 100 billion pesos lamang, ang iniwan sa atin. Ang 93.5 percent po, inilaan na sa kung saan-saan ng ating sinundan. Kaya naman, lumapit tayo sa pribadong sektor. Ang sabi natin: Kulang kami sa pondo, halina’t mag-ambagan tayo upang maipatayo ang mga kinakailangang imprastruktura.
May balakid din po tayong kinaharap nang magsimula ang PPP. Luma na ang mga pag-aaral na basehan ng mga proyekto; kulang sa kaalaman ang burukrasya para ipatupad ito. Idagdag pa natin ang publikong nagsawa nang magtiwala sa mga kontratang pinapasok ng gobyerno.
Gayumpaman, sa anuman pong situwasyon, ang ating prinsipyo: Gagawin na lang din natin, gawin na natin nang tama. Wala tayong balak na pumasok sa kuwestiyonableng kontrata ngayon, para lang ipamana ang problema sa susunod na administrasyon. Kailangang dumaan sa tamang proseso ang bawat proyekto, para masigurong ang perang inyong pinaghihirapan ay napupunta sa dapat nitong kalagyan.
Ngayon pa lang, nakikita na natin ang epekto ng maayos, tapat, at hayag na paglalatag sa PPP projects. Dati, may isang paliparan lang na maipagawa, napakalaki nang balita. Ikumpara po natin ngayon: Bukod sa pinapakinabangan na ang paliparan sa Laguindingan, sabay-sabay din ang proseso ng pagsasaayos at modernisasyon ng Tacloban Airport, Bicol International Airport, New Bohol Airport, Mactan Airport, at Puerto Princesa Airport. Ang Daang Hari-SLEX link road ang pinakamabilis na PPP project na nai-award sa alinmang administrasyon, nang walang shortcut na dinaanan ang proseso. [Applause] Ang mga ito, at ang napakarami pang ibang ipinapatayo at ipapatayong imprastruktura, ay manganganak ng isang lipunang hitik sa oportunidad.
Mahaba po ang listahan ng mga suliraning minana, at tinutugunan na natin. Halimbawa: Ang madalas na pag-brownout sa Mindanao. Mula’t sapul pa lang, naglalatag na tayo ng solusyon para dito, ngunit batid nating ang problemang isang dekadang binalewala ay hindi masosolusyonan sa isang tulog lang. Sa ngayon, patuloy ang paggawa natin ng mga hakbang upang tugunan ang mga kakulangan at agarang pangangailangan. Nariyan po ang pagtulong natin sa electric cooperatives upang makapagpasok sila ng generator sets ng magpapabawas sa mga brownout. Magtutuloy-tuloy ito hanggang makumpleto na ang mga plantang magsu-supply ng kuryente sa rehiyon.
Pero hindi po talaga mauubos ang mga kontra. Kesyo tataas daw ang presyo ng kuryente kapag may gensets dahil diesel ang ginagamit. May hydropower ngayon dahil tag-ulan, kaya umuugong na naman ang reklamo laban sa mga genset. Pero pagpasok ng tag-init, tiyak, marami na naman pong magrereklamo sa walong oras ng brownout.
Sa ibang bahagi naman po ng Pilipinas, gusto nating magtayo ng mga planta. Habang umuunlad kasi ang ekonomiya, tumataas din ang konsumo natin ng kuryente, at kailangang dagdagan ang supply nito. Gusto ba nating kapag sinagad na ang mga pagkukunan, saka lang tayo gagawa ng planta? Ang pagawa po niyan dalawa hanggang tatlong taon bawat planta. Hindi po kabuteng basta na lang susulpot ang mga ito.
Kung maganda ang mungkahi, handa naman po tayong makinig, pero sana naman ay makuha ng mga miron ang kabuuang konteksto ng situwasyon. Halimbawa po ang planta sa Redondo, Zambales. Pina-TRO [temporary restraining order] dahil mas maganda raw ang renewable. Sinabi rin po ba nilang mas mahal itong ipatayo, at mas mahal din ang magiging presyo ng enerhiya? Sinabi po kaya nilang hindi nito kayang tugunan ang baseload, o ang kapasidad na kailangang laging nariyan para hindi mag-brownout? Magtatayo ka ng wind; paano kung walang hangin? Kung solar, paano kung makulimlim? Lilinawin ko lang po: Naniniwala rin ako sa renewable energy at suportado natin ito, pero dapat ding may mga baseload plant na sisigurong tuloy-tuloy ang daloy ng kuryente sa ating mga tahanan at industriya.  Mag-iingay pa rin po kaya ang mga kumokontra, kung busy na sila sa kapapaypay dahil nag-brownout na? [Applause] Ang sa akin lang po: makiambag sana tayo sa paghahanap ng solusyon.
Tutal din po, nagtatapatan tayo: Pag-usapan naman natin ang pagsasaayos ng NAIA 3. Masalimuot po ang usapang ito. Dumaan na ito sa dalawang arbitration; naipanalo na sana natin pareho, pero binaliktad ang desisyon sa isa dahil sa technicality. Kaya nga po ngayon, pinaghahandaan ang muling pagdinig nito. Dagdag na komplikasyon po ang isyu ng warranty sa pagpapatapos ng NAIA 3—hindi naman puwedeng ‘pag may umusbong na depekto, pasensyahan na lang, dagdag-gastos pa. Kaya nga po nang ipinaliwanag sa atin na bibigyan tayo ng maayos na warranty ng orihinal na contractor, pumayag tayo. Pero gusto nating manigurado; gusto nating kumpletuhin nang tama at buo ang proseso, at hihingin ko po ang inyong pag-unawa ukol sa isyung ito.
Malinaw na po ngayon: Iisa ang tuon ng bawat metro kuwadrado ng sementong ibinubuhos natin bilang pundasyon ng mas maunlad na bansa: Pakinabang sa bawat isa—hindi politika. Kung dati, gumagawa ng kalsada kung saan lang kursunada, at nagpapatayo ng tulay kung saan kaibigan ni Madam si Mayor, ngayon, sumusunod na tayo sa isang pambansang plano. Walang paborito, walang transaksyunalismo, walang padrino; bawat piso, nakatuon sa ating pagpaspas tungo sa malawakang pag-unlad.
Ang maaasahan po natin sa mga susunod na taon: mga paliparan at daungang lalapagan ng kalakal at turista; mga kalsadang sisigurong husto ang pakinabang ng lahat sa malalaking proyektong ito; mga power plant na pagmumulan ng sapat na kuryente at magpapatakbo sa mga industriya. Ito ang magsisilbing balangkas na magsasanga ng iba pang inisyatibang dadaluyan ng oportunidad para kay Juan at Juana dela Cruz—mula sa mga magsasakang may sapat nang patubig at mabilis nang naibebenta ang ani, hanggang sa mga construction worker na nagtitindig ng mga bagong gusali; mula sa patuloy na pag-usbong ng mga call center, hanggang sa pagdami ng mga negosyanteng handang magpasok ng kapital sa bansa. Nagsulong tayo ng mga tamang proyekto sa tamang halaga; ginawa natin ito nang may tamang kalidad; at natapos o matatapos ito sa tamang panahon, dahil tama at karapat-dapat ang mga taong nagpapatupad nito.
Pag-usapan po natin ang trapiko: Di po ba’t tinatayang 2.4 billion pesos ang nawawala sa ating ekonomiya kada araw, dahil sa buhol-buhol na trapik sa Kamaynilaan? Kabilang sa mga proyekto nating pihadong magpapaluwag dito ay ang Integrated Transport System. Ang mga bus na nagsisiksik sa mga kalsadang punung-puno na nga, ginagawan natin ng terminal sa mga lugar na hindi kasing-sikip. Napapakinabangan na nga po ang terminal sa Parañaque, at nakapila na rin ang sa Quezon City at Muntinlupa. Ang pamprobinsyang bus ay hanggang dito nalang sa mga terminal na ito ng wala nang makipagsiksikan sa EDSA.
At nariyan din po ang dalawang connector road na magdurugtong sa North at South Luzon Expressway. Ang totoo nga po, dekada sitenta pa lang, plano nang ipatayo ang tinawag nilang Metro Manila Highway. Ito sana ang magkokonekta sa dalawang expressway, upang hindi na kailangang bunuin ang ilang oras na biyaheng babagtas pa sa kahabaan ng EDSA. Ang problema po: Nag-atas si Ginoong Marcos ng mga batas na pabor sa kanyang crony. Nakatali tayo sa pagsunod sa mga batas na ito: Sino mang magpatayo ng imprastruktura sa lugar na iyon, dapat kasosyo ang korporasyon ng kanyang kaibigan. Masaklap po: nae-extend ng 30 taon ang kanilang prangkisa sa tuwing magkakabit sila ng kahit isang dipa lang ng kalsada sa orihinal. Dagdagan pa po natin: nang kumita ang kumpanya, hindi nakumpleto ang pagpapalawig o pagpapaunlad sa mga imprastraktura’t daan. Tandaan po n’yo na dapat umabot sa Carmen, Rosales, sa Pangasinan at Lucena sa Quezon ang mga kalsadang nabanggit at yung Metro Manila Highway o Expressway, hanggang ngayon wala pa.  Nang nalugi naman, nakuha pang ipasa sa gobyerno ang utang. Ilalapit ko na po ito sa ating Kongreso: Silipin po nating muli ang Presidential Decrees 1113 at 1894.
Sa kabila nito, tuloy po ang mga proyekto natin. Mayroon tayong walong kilometrong four-lane elevated expressway na kokonekta sa C3 Road sa Caloocan patawid ng España, hanggang sa PUP [Polytechnic University of the Philippines] sa Sta. Mesa. Mayroon ding mahigit 14 kilometrong six-lane elevated tollway na babagtas mula Balintawak, hanggang Buendia, sa Makati. Ang Common Alignment naman po ng dalawang kalsadang ito, lima’t kalahating kilometrong six-lane elevated expressway mula PUP sa Sta. Mesa, patawid sa kalagitnaan ng Osmeña at Quirino Avenue, hanggang Buendia sa Makati. Oras na mabuksan ang kalsada, ang biyaheng SLEX hanggang NLEX na dati’y inaabot ng dalawang oras, kaya nang takbuhin ng 15 minuto. Ang Clark naman hanggang Calamba na pumapalo noon sa tatlong oras, halos mangangalahati at magiging 1 oras at 40 minuto. [Applause] Kada araw, tinatayang 55,000 motorista ang makikinabang sa mga ito. Tipid sa oras, tipid sa gas, menos sa polusyon, lalago pa ang komersiyo’t turismo. Talaga naman pong win-win situation, di po ba?
Sa loob nga po ng tatlong taon, pinatunayan nating ang mga ahensyang dati’y pugad ng kurapsyon ay maaaring maging ehemplo ng tapat at epektibong paglilingkod. Ilan po sa mga simple ngunit epektibong pagbabagong isinagawa ni Secretary Babes Singson ng DPWH: Wala nang letter of intent, na ginagamit ng mga bidder para magkuntsabahan; pinasimple ang proseso ng bidding, kaya mas marami nang nagkukumpitensya para sa proyekto, at mas sulit na ang presyong nakukuha ng gobyerno. Nasa oras na ring magbayad ang gobyerno, kaya mas nae-engganyo ang mahuhusay na contractor na makiambag sa pagtatayo ng pambansang imprastruktura. Dahil sa tapat na pamamahala, 18.4 billion pesos na ang natitipid ng DPWH, na inilalaan para sa iba pang makabuluhang proyekto. [Applause]
Bilang halimbawa ng resulta ng mabuting pamamahala, tingnan natin ang Tagumbao Bridge sa Gerona, Tarlac. Sa totoo lang, congressman pa lang po ako, iminungkahi ko na ito. May mga nasasakupan kasi tayong kailangan pang umikot ng dalawang bayan para tawirin ang umaapaw na ilog tuwing tag-ulan. Sabi ko nga po sa mga dating administrasyon: Sa inyo na ang buong PDAF [Priority Development Assistance Fund] ko, magawa lang ito. Kung puwede sana installment plan. Pero wala pong nangyari. Lumawak lang ang idurugtong ng tulay dahil sa nababakbak na pampang.
Kasalukuyan na po nating ginagawa ang Tagumbao Bridge. At heto po ang kuwento ngayong tayo na ang nagpapatupad nito: Nasa 334 million pesos ang aprubadong pondo; pero dahil sa tamang pangangasiwa’t tapat na paggugol, naibaba ito sa 226 million pesos. [Applause] Suma-tutal, nakatipid tayo ng mahigit 108 million pesos nang hindi isinasakripisyo ang kalidad ng ipinapagawang tulay. At lalong maganda pa nga po, ang natipid na pondong ito ay magagamit sa pagpapagawa ng dike at river training works para sa Phase II ng proyekto.
Dumako naman po tayo sa turismo. Ayon sa banyagang pahayagang Oriental Morning Post, the “Best Tourist Destination of 2012” tayo.  Para namang na-inlove ang Shanghai Morning Post sa ating bansa, nang binansagan nila tayong “Most Romantic Destination of 2012.” [Applause] Hopefully they will love us more. Sabi naman ng Scuba Diving Magazine, “Best Diving Destination” ang Pilipinas. [Applause] “Best Island” naman daw ang Palawan, kung tatanungin ang Travel + Leisure Magazine. Kulang na nga lang po ay tawagin na tayong paraiso. [Applause]
Hindi na po nakakapagtakang sa mauugong na papuring tulad nito, naitala natin noong 2012 ang 4.3 million tourist arrivals sa ating bansa—isang panibagong record high; 21.4 percent na po ang inilalago ng numerong ito mula nang pumasok tayo noong 2010, kung kailan nasa tinatayang 3.1 million na turista pa lang ang bumibisita sa atin. Pagdating naman sa ating domestic travelers, ang target natin dati para sa taong 2016 ay 35.5 million tourists. Pero nitong 2011 pa lamang po, nalampasan na natin ito sa 37.5 million domestic tourists. [Applause] Ngayon po, sa momentum nating ito, tiwala tayong maaabot ang bagong target na 56—ulitin ko po—56.1 million bago matapos ang 2016. [Applause]
Ang mas malakas na sektor ng turismo, manganganak ng mas maraming trabaho. Tinataya ng DOT [Department of Tourism] na nakapag-ambag ang turismo ng 3.8 million na trabaho noong 2011. Ang totoo nga po, hindi lang mga lugar na may magagandang tanawin ang nakikinabang sa pagdayo ng turista, kundi pati ang mga karatig-bayang maituturing na tourism support communities: Ang mga lugar na pinanggagalingan ng pagkaing inihahanda sa mga resort, ng mga souvenir na ibinebenta, at ng iba pang mga produkto’t serbisyong nagsisilbing bukal ng kaunlaran para sa mga lalawigan.
Malamang, narinig na rin po ninyo ang mga good news na lumapag kamakailan sa bansa. Noong Marso, inalis po ng International Civil Aviation Organization ang significant safety concerns na ipinataw sa Pilipinas. Bunga po ito ng mga reporma sa aviation industry upang siguruhing pasok sa pandaigdigang pamantayan ang aviation safety sa Pilipinas. [Applause] Dahil po dito, sa wakas, noon lamang ika-10 ng Hulyo, muli nang pinahintulutan ng European Union ang direktang paglipad ng ating flag carrier sa Europa. [Applause]
Isipin po ninyo, paano kaya kung dati pa inayos at pinalakas ang ating aviation industry? Di po ba’t sayang ang pagbisita ng mga turistang nawalan ng ganang dumalaw sa Pilipinas dahil dito? Naglahong trabaho, pondo, at oportunidad—ito ang resulta ng lumang sistema ng pamamahala.
Kaya naman, simula’t sapul, nilabanan na natin ang katiwalian sa lahat ng antas ng pamahalaan at isinulong ang transpormasyon sa ating mga institusyon. Ang resulta: tunay na serbisyong pampubliko.
Tingnan na lang po natin ang lalim ng transpormasyong nangyari sa mga GOCC [government-owned and -controlled corporation]. Ang dating mga kumpanya ng bayang inaambagan mo pa dahil sa pagkalugi, naghahatid na ng dibidendo ngayon. Gamitin po nating halimbawa ang Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA). Sa loob ng 13 taon bago tayo dumating, ang suma-total ng dibidendo ng PRA: 676.82 million pesos. Sa tuwid na daan, para sa 2012 lamang, ang dibidendo nila: 1 bilyong piso. Napakalaking transpormasyon, di po ba? [Applause]
Mabuting halimbawa rin ang Local Water Utilities Administration. Noong 2011, ang recorded net loss ng naturang GOCC: 950 million pesos. Pero dahil sa maayos na pangangasiwa, di lang nila nagawang balansehin ang kanilang mga libro; ayon sa kanilang report, umabot ang kanilang kabuuang kita sa 870 million pesos noong 2012. [Applause] Dahil dito, nagawa nilang makapag-remit ng 365 million pesos sa pamahalaan para sa taong iyon.
Isa pa pong halimbawa: Sa una kong SONA, isiniwalat natin ang kuwestyunableng kalakaran sa MWSS [Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System]: Patung-patong na bonus at allowance ang ibinigay sa sarili, sa kabila ng kapalpakan nilang tugunan ang pangangailangan ng ating mga kababayan. Ang ahensya na nga po ang nag-ulat: Umabot sa 34 million pesos ang pagkalugi ng MWSS noong 2010. Hindi ito katanggap-tanggap. Kaya noong 2011, pinirmahan natin ang GOCC Governance Act, na nagsisilbing saligan ng katapatan, kredibilidad, at pananagutan sa pamamalakad ng ating mga GOCC. Ang ibinunga nito: Noong 2011, 333 million pesos ang kinita ng MWSS mula sa pagkalugi ng 34 million pesos. [Applause] Noong 2012 naman po, ang kinita nila: halos 2 bilyong piso. Kakambal nito, lumago rin ang kanilang dibidendo: [applause] mula sa 150 million pesos noong 2011, umakyat ito sa 345 million pesos para sa 2012. Nakakalungkot nga po, na kung ano ang lalim ng pagbabagong itinanim ng mga pinuno ng MWSS, iyon din naman ang dumi ng putik na ibinabato sa kanila ng mga gusto pa ring kumapit sa lumang sistema.
Kaakibat ng pagtaas ng kumpiyansa sa ating mabuting pamamahala, ang patuloy na pag-angat ng ating ekonomiya. Ang resulta: Dalawang magkasunod na 10-place jump sa Global Competitiveness Index ng World Economic Forum. Sa unang pagkakataon, nakuha natin ang investment grade status mula sa dalawa sa tatlong pinakatanyag na credit ratings agencies sa mundo, at hindi malayong sumunod ang ikatlo. [Applause] Napanatili ang stabilidad ng presyo ng mga bilihin, at patuloy din ang pagbaba ng bahagi sa ating budget na pambayad-utang, at ang paglaki naman ng pondong nailalaan sa mga serbisyong panlipunan. Sa panahong matamlay ang pandaigdigang ekonomiya, nagpamalas tayo ng kahanga-hangang 6.8 percent GDP [gross domestic product] growth noong 2012. Nahigitan pa natin itong first quarter ng 2013, kung kailan naitala ang paglagong 7.8 percent—pinakamataas na recorded GDP sa Timog-Silangan, [applause] pati na sa Silangang Asya. Special mention po dapat ang 28.5 percent na ambag ng manufacturing sa inilaki ng ating ekonomiya. Inaasahan po nating aarangkada pa ang manufacturing sa mga darating na panahon.
Tinagurian na po tayo ngayon bilang “rising tiger,” ayon sa World Bank; “brightest spark,” ayon sa pahayag ng Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, at iba pang mga bansag na tumutukoy sa transpormasyong nangyayari sa ating bansa. Mula sa matuwid na paggugol ng pondo, hanggang sa epektibong koleksyon ng buwis; mula sa pagpapaunlad ng imprastruktura hanggang sa maaliwalas nang pagnenegosyo na lumilikha ng trabaho, talaga namang malinaw ang pahayag natin sa mundo: Kaya nang makipagsabayan ng Pilipinas sa agos ng kaunlaran.
Hindi lang po sa ekonomiya o stadistika nakikita ang transpormasyon ng ating lipunan. Ngayon, alam na ng Pilipino: Mayaman ka man o mahirap, may kakilala sa poder o wala, kapag gumawa ka ng mali, mananagot ka. Tunay nang nakapiring ang katarungan. Hindi mababali ang atas ng ating mga Boss: Panagutin ang tiwali, at itama ang mali sa sistemang kay tagal nagpahirap sa ating bayan.
Pinapanagot na po natin ang dating namumuno ng TESDA dahil sangkot siya sa katakut-takot na tongpats sa ahensya. Halimbawa: Ang isang incubator jar, nagkakahalaga ng 149 pesos. Pero kay Ginoong Syjuco ayon sa mga datos 15,375 pesos. Ang normal na presyo ng dough cutter, 120 pesos. Ang presyo kay Ginoong Syjuco: 48,507 pesos. Linawin po natin, dough cutter po ito, at hindi Hamilton Class Cutter. Baka nga po kapag hinarap na niya ang kasong isinampa ng Ombudsman, matuto nang magbilang itong si Ginoong Syjuco.
Nakahabla po ang dating mga opisyal ng PAGCOR [Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation] na naglustay ng 26.7 million pesos para lamang gumawa ng pelikula; nagsunog ng 186 million pesos para sa isang partylist; at nagawa pang gamitin na pampapogi sa kampanya ang rice donations na nakalaan sana para sa mga biktima ng kalamidad.
Hinaharap na rin po ng mga dating pinuno ng PNP ang paratang ukol sa 131.6 million pesos na nawaldas para sa 75 depektibong rubber boat, at 104.99 million pesos para sa maanumalyang pagbili ng mga segunda-manong helicopter mula 2009 hanggang 2010. Mas mainam nga po kung masagot nila nang tama ang mga tanong ukol dito, nang matukoy natin kung may iba pang dapat managot.
Sa usaping Cadavero, PDAF, MRT 3, at iba pa: Dahil hindi alam ng ilang kritiko ang ginagawa namin, palagay nila wala kaming ginagawa sa mga isyung ito. Kung wala pang tangan na datos ang gobyerno at ipagsigawan naming, “Iimbestigahan namin kayo,” di ba’t para na rin naming sinabi sa mga kakasuhan na, “Pakitago naman po ‘nyo nang mahusay ang lahat ng ebidensya?” Kaya tutungo tayo kung saan tayo ituturo ng katotohanan; ebidensya ang magdidikta sa ating mga hakbang.
Nang inihayag nating “walang wangwang,” hindi lang natin binaklas ang mga sirena ng mga naghahari-harian sa kalsada; binungkal din natin ang kultura ng katiwalian na noo’y tila nakaugat na sa mga pampublikong institusyon.
Pero magtapatan po tayo: Hanggang ngayon, may ilan pa ring ahensya ng gobyerno na ayaw yata talagang tumino. Nakakadismaya po ang lalim at ang pagsanga-sanga ng kanilang mga galamay sa ating burukrasya; malingat lang tayo, pihadong may aabusuhin at bibiktimahin na naman sila. Magpangalan na po tayo: sa Bureau of Immigration, paulit-ulit nating pinagsabihang ayusin ang pagbabantay sa ating mga daungan at paliparan. Pero paanong nakalabas ng bansa ang magkapatid na Joel at Mario Reyes, ang mga pangunahing suspek sa pagpaslang kay Gerry Ortega? Bakit nangyari pa rin na kitang-kita sa mismong CCTV ang pagtakas ng Koreano na si Park Sungjun? Wanted po siya sa Korea, at nanghingi ng tulong ang kanyang gobyerno upang hulihin siya. Anong mukha naman po ang ihaharap natin gayong mismong mga kawani ng ating gobyerno ang naghatid sa kanya at hinayaan siyang makatakas?
Nakakatuyo din po ng pasensya ang kultura ng “pwede na” sa National Irrigation Administration. Imbes na maglatag ng plano para sa mga bagong patubig, kuntento na sila sa paulit-ulit na rehabilitasyon ng mga irigasyon. Masabi lang na may nagawa, kahit puro patsi-patseng trabaho, masaya na sila. Noon nga pong kanilang anibersaryo, itinanong ko kung bakit nasa 60 percent na naman lang ang kanilang target ang naabot noong 2012, kung umabot na sila sa 87 percent noong 2011. Kinabukasan, nagkita kami ng kanilang magaling na administrador sa NEDA [National Economic and Development Authority] Board meeting. Ang sabi niya sakin, “Sir, ang dahilan kaya 60 percent lang, 40 percent daw po kasi ng target nila ay para sa Mindanao, bagyong Pablo ang dumating at tinamaan kaya na-delay sila ng 40 percent.” Kailan po ba tumama ang Pablo? Noong unang linggo ng Disyembre. Ibig sabihin, binalak niyang tapusin ang 40 percent ng kanyang trabaho para sa taon, sa loob lamang ng tatlong linggo. Hindi po natin kailangan ng ganitong uri ng pamamahala sa loob ng burukrasya.
Para namang nakikipagtagisan sa kapalpakan itong Bureau of Customs. Imbes na maningil ng tamang buwis at pigilan ang kontrabando, parang walang pakundangan ang pagpapalusot nila ng kalakal, pati na ng ilegal na droga, armas, at iba pa sa ating teritoryo. Tinataya nga po ng Department of Finance na mahigit 200 billion pesos ang kita na dumudulas lang at hindi napupunta sa kaban ng bayan. Saan po kayo kumukuha ng kapal ng mukha ang mga kawani sa ahensyang ito? [Applause] Marami pong gabi bago ako matulog, talaga pong aking iniisip, kulang na lang ay sabihin nilang, “Wala akong pakialam kung mapunta sa masasamang loob ang armas; wala akong pakialam kung ilang buhay ang masira ng droga; wala akong pakialam kung habambuhay na matigang ang mga sakahan. Ang mahalaga, yumaman ako; bahala ka sa buhay mo.” Hindi maaaring ganito ang kalakaran sa pamahalaan. Kung hindi mo nagagawa ang iyong trabaho, hindi ka karapat-dapat na manatili sa pwesto. [Applause]
Kung matino kang kawani ng Bureau of Immigration, ng National Irrigation Administration, ng Customs, o ng kahit ano pang ahensya ng gobyerno, sana makiambag ka pa lalo. Hindi sapat na yumuko sa loob ng cubicle; bahagi ng trabaho mo ay ang pagpigil sa mali. Nasa tama kayo, kaya’t huwag po kayong magtago; padaliin ninyo ang pagnanais kong mahanap kayo; paaangatin ko kayo nang paaangatin upang ibandila ang inyong mabuting ehemplo, at mabago na ang maling kultura sa inyong mga naturang ahensya. [Applause]
Para naman po sa mga kawaning walang balak tumalikod sa kulturang wangwang: Tapos na ang pakikiusap. Nagkaroon kayo ng tatlong taon para ipakitang handa kayong umayos; ngayon, hahanapin, kung hindi pa kayo nahahanap, pero ‘yung di ko pa nahanap, lalahatin na po natin kayong lahat; ngayon, pasensyahan tayo. [Applause]
Isabay na rin po natin sa pagbabago ang tiwaling mga miyembro ng Civil Service. Panahon pa lang po ng nanay ko, narinig ko na ang hirit na, “Ano ngayon kung utos ng Malacañang? Anim na taon lang kayo diyan.” Kailangan pong itama ang ganitong klaseng pag-iisip. Nananawagan po ako sa Kongreso: Suriin natin ang ating Civil Service Code at PD 1, [applause] upang maisaayos ito sa lalong madaling panahon. Suportado ko ang pagbuo ng mekanismong magbabalik sa dangal ng serbisyo-publiko; na tanging mga tapat, mahuhusay, at may prinsipyong mga lingkod-bayan lamang ang maaaring makapasok at manatili sa gobyerno.
Ngayon naman po, hayaan natin ang ating mga kababayang magpahayag ng transpormasyong nangyayari sa lipunan:

[Video starts]
“Ako po si Violeta S. Abuque. ‘Yong buhay po namin noong walang Pantawid Pamilya, dahil nga sa hirap ng buhay, wala kang puwedeng lapitan, wala kang puwedeng gamitin na pera. Saan ka lumapit, walang puwedeng magpahiram sa’yo dahil sila rin po, mahirap rin sa buhay.
“Laking tuwa po namin nang biglang nagkaroon po ng programa ‘yong DSWD, naabot po kami sa kabundukan. Magiging katuwang ko siya para makapag-aral nang maayos ang mga bata.
“Namulat po talaga kami na kailangan palang tustusin ‘yung mga bata sa pag-aaral, para hindi na magaya sa mga ninuno namin na kahit pangalan lang po ay hindi maisulat.
“Nagpapasalamat po talaga ako, unang-una, sa Pantawid Pamilya, sa mga sumuporta po nito.”
—Violeta S. Abuque, CCT beneficiary
“‘Yong dati’y sila’y pumapasok noon na medyo walang baon. Eh noong magkaroon na kami, may baon na sila, nag-aalmusal na.
“Kailangan ‘yong kasama doon sa kasunduan, magampanan mo talaga. Siyempre, kailangan pagyamanin mo rin ‘yong tulong niya, gumawa ka rin ng paraan kung paano mo pa madadagdagan. Kaya gumagawa kami ng anak ko, tulong kami, ng peanut butter binebenta namin linggo-linggo.
“Nagpapasalamat po ako na napabilang ako sa isa sa Pantawid na programang ito, kasi malaking tulong po ito sa aming pamilya.”

“Para matustusan din po ‘yong paghahanap ko ng trabaho, nagbalik po ako bilang magbabalut. May free training daw si TESDA. Binasa ko ‘yong impormasyon tungkol doon, at hanggang sa magpa-register po ako. Masaya po ako sa naitulong ng TESDA program, dahil, ito na, nalaman ko na kung ano siya, ‘yong trabahong ginugusto ko. At saka, nagagamit ko na siya ngayon sa ikauunlad ko pa at ikatututo ko pa, habang ginagawa ko po ‘yong trabaho ko.
—Emerson Paguia, TESDA scholar
“April 2 po, 6:45 ng umaga, papunta po ako ng PCCR review center. May nakasakay po ako na holdaper sa jeep. Sa taas po ng Nagtahan flyover, nag-declare po siya ng holdup. Tinutukan niya po ako ng kutsilyo. Nakipaglaban po ako, nasaksak niya po ako sa hita, naagaw ko po sa kanya ‘yong kutsilyo, at noong bago po siya bumaba ng jeep, nasaksak ko po siya sa likod. Pagbaba po niya ng jeep, hinabol ko po siya, parehas po kaming duguan. ‘Yun po siguro ‘yong nakatawag pansin po sa taong-bayan para mahuli po yung holdaper.
“Inisip ko rin po ‘yong sinumpuang serbisyo ko sa taong-bayan. Sa kapwa ko pulis: Gumawa lang po tayo ng tama, at kung ano ‘yong mabuti para sa kapakanan ng ating bayan—at the same time po, magiging reflection ng ginagawa natin sa PNP.”
—PO3 Edlyn Arbo
“Na-assign ako dito sa Police Station 4, 2006 hanggang 2012. Binigyan ako ng spot meritorious promotion ng ating Pangulo, dahil siguro sa apprehension ko ng mga most wanted na criminal dito sa Bacolod City. Noong nakaraang Sabado, ‘yung binigay na baril sa akin ng ating Pangulo ay nagamit ko na sa pagdakip ng isang notorious na bukas-kotse dito sa Bacolod City.
“Nagtatrabaho tayo, kahit na mahirap, kahit na ang buhay natin ay ating itataya, para lang makapagsilbi tayo sa ating kapwa at sa bayan.”
—PO3 Felipe Moncatar
“Noong nasiraan ako dito sa may Quezon Avenue, bago mag-tunnel, after 15 minutes may dumating na, I think he’s a policeman. Pero ‘tong pulis na ‘to, tinulungan talaga ako. He even tried to lift the car with his bare hands. So I was thinking na baka, eventually, humingi ng pera ‘to. Then dumating ‘yong wrecker, nire-wreck na ‘yung sasakyan ko, tinotow na kaagad. Sabi ng pulis: No, tulong muna bago hatak.
“Out of my gratitude, binibigyan ko siya ng 1,000 kasi tinulungan niya ko. Pero di niya tinanggap. Ang sagot niya sa ’kin: ‘Ang trabaho namin ay tumulong sa mamamayan’.”
“May pagbabago na sa ating mga kapulisan. Para kay PO Sultan: I salute you.”
—Armin Punzalan, businessman
“Sa ngayon, ‘yong tinatawag nating modernization program ng Navy, hindi lang naman gamit ‘yan e. Kaakibat na rin yung para sa mga welfare sa mga tao natin. At nakikita naman namin—hindi lang ako, sampu ng aking mga kasama sa  Hukbong Dagat ng Pilipinas: Natutuwa kami sa mga changes na nakikita namin. ‘Yong tuwid na daan ng ating Pangulo, talagang nararamdaman talaga namin. Masaya kami ngayon; wala na kaming hihilingin pa. Kaya sabi ko sa mga kasama ko, ibinibigay na sa ’tin ng gobyerno lahat. Gawin naman natin trabaho natin, at ibalik natin para sa bayan, para sa mga tao.”
—Lt. Commander Desuasido, Philippine Navy

[Applause]
Ni minsan, hindi naman nagkulang ang bansa natin ng mga taong handang manindigan at lumaban, kahit gaano pa kalaki ang mga pagsubok sa kaniyang harapan. Nariyan ang tapang na ipinamalas ni Commodore Ramon Alcaraz noong Ikalawang Digmaang Pandaigdig. Lulan ng isang Q-Boat na yari sa kahoy, sinagupa niya ang siyam na Zero fighter ng hapon, na itinuturing noon na isa sa pinakamodernong eroplano; tatlo nito ang napabagsak niya. Ang totoo nga po, tuluy-tuloy pa rin siyang lalaban, kung hindi pa ang sarili niyang mga pinuno ang nag-atas sa kanyang sumuko. Ang kagitingang ito ang araw-araw ding ipinapamalas ng mga sundalo nating nagtatanod sa mga pinakaliblib na kabundukan, at sa pinakamalalayo nating isla; mga kawal na tinitiis ang layo sa pamilya, at taas-noong naninindigan sa sinumang sumusubok sa ating soberanya. Hindi rin po kalabisang isiping ang mga tagumpay natin sa tuwid na daan ay maaaring pangarap pa rin hanggang ngayon kung wala ang mga miyembro naman ng ating Gabinete. Nang inalok ko silang maging bahagi ng ating pamahalaan, alam nilang hindi magiging madali ang kanilang trabaho. Subalit maituturing na biyaya na tinanggap nila ang hamon, nanumpa silang tutulong sa transpormasyon, at simula’t sapul, araw-araw silang nagsasakripisyo upang hindi masayang ang pribilehiyong paglingkuran kayo.
May mga katulad ni Kalihim Albert del Rosario. Kung ibabase sa tradisyon, ang unang opisyal na biyahe sa labas ng Pilipinas ng isang kalihim ay sa mga bansang may matibay at mapayapa tayong ugnayan. Ngunit pagkatapos niyang manumpa bilang Foreign Affairs Secretary, kumuha lang yata ng pambihis, lumipad agad si Secretary del Rosario patungong Libya; dumaan sa mahigit 20 checkpoint sa gitna ng putukan, at pinamunuan ang paglikas ng mahigit 20,000 Pilipino na naipit sa kaguluhan sa Libya. [Applause] Baka po magulat kayo pag narinig ninyo kung taga-saang bansa ang mga banyagang nakiangkas pa sa ating paglilikas. Iba na nga po ang Pilipinas ngayon: Imbes na tayo lang ang parating tinutulungan, ngayon, kaya na rin nating tumulong sa mga dayuhan. [Applause] Kung tutuusin, maaari namang tanggihan ni Secretary Albert ang pagtatrabaho sa gobyerno. Isa siyang respetado’t matagumpay na negosyante, at tiyak na mas magiging komportable siya sa pribadong buhay. Dati na rin po nating siyang nakiambag bilang ambassador natin sa Amerika. Puwede naman siyang nadismaya na lang nang pababain siya sa puwesto, dahil tinutulan niya ang pagdeklara ng State of Emergency ng nakaraang administrasyon noong 2006. Pero tinawag po natin siya para bumalik, at tumugon siya. Ngayon po, nagbibigay siya ng mas malaki pang ambag bilang kalihim. Handa niyang ilagay ang sarili sa panganib, dahil alam niyang walang ibang sasaklolo sa Pilipino kundi ang kapwa rin Pilipino. Sa patuloy mong paninindigan para sa ating karapatan, saludo po ako sa inyo, Secretary Albert del Rosario. [Applause]
Transpormasyon din po ang dulot ng inspirasyong hatid ng matitinong lingkod-bayan. Nagluksa ang milyun-milyong Pilipino sa pagpanaw ni Jesse Robredo. Sa loob ng halos dalawang dekada, namuno siya nang may husay, malasakit, at pagpapakumbaba sa Naga. Ang mga prinsipyong ito nga mismo ang dahilan kung bakit hiniram natin siya mula kay Congresswoman Leni, at sa tatlo nilang mga anak, at sa mga Nagueño, upang maging bahagi ng ating Gabinete. Kaya nga po, matapos ang trahedya, isa na siguro sa pinakamahirap na tungkuling ginampanan ko ang paghahatid ng balita kina Leni at kanilang mga anak.
Bukod sa pagluluksa, hindi ko maiwasang sisihin ang sarili ko dahil sa sinapit ni Jesse. Baka kung hindi ko siya hinikayat mapabilang sa Gabinete, buhay pa siya ngayon. Baka kung nanatili na lamang siya sa Naga, kapiling pa natin siya. Baka may isa pa ring Jesse Robredo na naglilingkod ngayon.
Subalit sa isang banda, alam kong hindi hahayaan ni Jesse na tumigil sa kanya ang pagbabago at pagtutuwid ng lipunan. Nabigyan lamang ako, at nabigyan din lamang si Jesse, ng pagkakataong maglingkod sa bansa dahil sa inyo. Hindi nag-iisa ang mukha ng pagbabago. Hindi na aabutin pa ng isandaang taon bago isilang ang susunod na mabuting tao, bago tumindig ang susunod na mabuting Pilipino.
May mga nagtatanong nga po lagi sa akin: Paano na sa 2016? Paano pag bumaba ka na? Tapos na rin ba ang tapat na pamamahala? Tapos na ba ang tuwid na daan?
Mga Boss, isipin nga po natin: Saan ba tayo nagmula? Kung may agam-agam kayo ngayon, ano ba naman ito kumpara sa agam-agam natin noong 2010? Di ba’t masaya na tayo noon na tapos na ang panahon ng kadiliman? Di ba’t noon, sapat nang mapalitan ang mga nasa kapangyarihan?
Ngayon, tinatamasa na natin ang pagbabago. Mula ito sa mga butil ng malasakit, ng pakikipagkapwa, ng pagkakawang-gawa; nanggaling ito sa milyun-milyong Pilipinong kahit sa pinakapayak na paraan ay nagkusang makiambag sa transpormasyon ng bansa.
Sa pag-aambagang ito, tingnan ninyo ang ating narating: May nakaisip bang magiging abot-kamay na ang kapayapaan sa rehiyong 40 taon nang pinupunit ng hidwaan? Di ba’t gawa ito ng mga Morong handang magbaba ng armas at sinabing, “Halika, mag-usap na tayo, nagtitiwala ako”? Di ba’t gawa ito ng karaniwang mamamayang nagsabing, “Kapatid, pareho tayong Pilipino, tama na nga ang gulo”? [Applause]
Nang unang iminungkahi ang Pantawid Pamilya, nariyan ang tanong: Paanong maaabot ang kailangan nitong epekto; nasaan ang pondo para masaklaw ang lahat ng maralitang Pilipino? May nag-akala bang, matapos lamang ang tatlong taon, aabot sa halos 4 milyong kabahayan ang nagiging benepisyaryo nito? At di ba’t sila rin—ang bawat inang gumigising nang maaga para ipaghanda ang anak niyang papasok sa eskuwela, ang bawat batang nag-aaral nang mabuti—di ba’t sila rin ang nakiambag at patuloy na nakikiambag para magtagumpay ang programang ito?
May nag-akala bang mula sa pag-aangkat ng milyun-milyong toneladang bigas, sa pagtatapos pa lang ng 2012 ay 94 percent rice self-sufficient na tayo? May nag-akala bang ang dating “Sick Man of Asia,” sa loob lamang ng tatlong taon ng tapat na pamamahala, ay nasa investment grade status na? Sino nga po ba ang nag-isip na maipapatupad ang lahat ng serbisyong panlipunan natin ngayon, nang di nagtataas ng buwis maliban siyempre sa Sin Tax? Di ba’t nakiambag dito ang bawat accountant, doktor, abugado, na ngayon ay nagbabayad ng tamang buwis? Di ba’t nakiambag tayong lahat dito?
May puwang pa ba para sa mga agam-agam? Ngayon pa bang natutupad na ang mga dating ni hindi natin magawang pangarapin, ngayon pa bang nakausad na tayo, at abot-kamay na ang ating mga hangarin—Boss, ngayon pa ba tayo magdududa?
Sa bawat Pilipinong nagtitiwala sa kapangyarihan ng maliliit na anyo ng kabutihan: Kayo nga po ang gumawa ng pagbabago. SONA po ninyo ito.
Sa bawat gurong bumabangon nang madaling-araw para magturo sa kanayunan: SONA mo ito.
Sa bawat pulis na nagsilbi at hindi nanghingi ng kapalit: SONA po n’yo ito.
Sa mga hindi panatag sa listahan ng mga tatakbo sa halalan, at kinatok ang kapitbahay para sabihing, “Huwag tayong makuntento, magtulungan tayong humanap ng karapat-dapat na pinuno,” SONA mo ito.
Sa bawat estudyanteng mulat sa mga napapanahong isyu sa lipunan, at sa halip na magreklamo lang sa Facebook ay nagmumungkahi ng solusyon: SONA mo ito. [Applause]
Kay Brigadier General Ramon Mateo Dizon, paretirong pinuno ng Presidential Security Group, na kasama ko na noon pa, laban sa mga kudeta noong panahon ng nanay ko: Hanggang sa aking pagkapangulo, pinangalagaan mo ang seguridad ko, pati na ng personal at opisyal kong pamilya. Buong kumpiyansa akong pumunta, sa ibang bansa man o sa mga liblib na sulok ng Pilipinas. Chito, nakiambag ka rin sa pagbabago; tunay kang tapat sa watawat, sa Saligang Batas, at sa sambayanang Pilipino. [Applause] Siyempre, kung di ka inalalayan ng iyong butihing maybahay na si Jo-ann, hindi mo naabot ang iyong mga tagumpay. SONA n’yong dalawa ito. [Applause]
At sa lahat ng mga gumising sa nagtutulug-tulugan, sa mga nagmulat sa mga nagbubulag-bulagan, sa mga kumalampag sa mga nagbibingi-bingihan: SONA po ninyo ito. [Applause]
Mahaba pa ang ating lalakbayin, at hindi natin kailanman sinabing madali o walang mga hadlang sa landas na ito. Subalit wala akong duda sa kakayahan nating lampasan ang anumang barikada. Hindi tsamba ang mga tagumpay na tinatamasa natin ngayon; huwag tayong papayag na maging panandalian lamang ang transpormasyon. Samantalahin natin ang pagkakataon upang gawing permanente ang pagbabago.
Ito po ang aking ikaapat na SONA. Noong ako’y Congressman, ang mga taga-Tarlac ang aking lakas; nang ako’y maging Senador, at hanggang ngayon, sa aking pagkapangulo, nariyan ang sambayanan—Pilipinas, kayo ang aking lakas. [Applause] Sa patuloy nating pag-aambagan at pananalig sa kapwa at sa Maykapal, sinasabi ko po sa inyo: Kayo pa rin ang sisigurong magpapatuloy ang ating nasimulan; kayo ang sisigurong mabubura na nang tuluyan ang mukha ng katiwalian; kayo ang sisigurong hinding-hindi na tayo muling lilihis sa tuwid na daan.
Sinabi po sa akin dati: Noynoy, simulan mo lang, at sinimulan nga po natin, at ngayon, kitang-kita na ang layo ng ating narating. Ngayon, Pilipino, ituloy natin ang pagkakapit-bisig, sabay nating arugain, pabilisin, at palawakin ang transpormasyon ng lipunan. Ako po si Noynoy Aquino; ipinagmamalaki ko sa buong mundo: Pilipino ako. At talagang napakasarap maging Pilipino sa panahong ito.
Maraming salamat po. Magandang hapon po sa lahat. [Applause]

State of the Nation Address
of
His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III
President of the Philippines
To the Congress of the Philippines
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 28, 2014]
Bise Presidente Jejomar Binay; dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos; Senate President Franklin M. Drilon at mga miyembro ng Senado; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. at mga miyembro ng Kamara de Representante; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno at ang ating mga mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga miyembro ng Gabinete; mga opisyal ng lokal na pamahalaan; mga kasapi ng militar, pulis, at iba pang kawani mula sa ating unipormadong hanay; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at sa aking mga Boss, ang mga minamahal kong kababayan:
Magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat.
Ito po ang aking ikalimang SONA, isa na lamang ang natitira. May kasabihan po tayo: Ang hindi lumingon sa pinanggalingan, hindi makararating sa paroroonan. Kaya marapat lang po siguro tayong magbalik-tanaw:
Noon, sa sitwasyon natin: Para bang kahibangan ang mangarap. May burukrasyang walang saysay, patong-patong ang tongpats, at bumubukol ang korupsyon sa sistema. Naturingan tayong “Sick Man of Asia.”  Ang ekonomiya natin, matamlay; ang industriya, manipis. Walang kumpiyansang mamuhunan sa atin pong bansa. Ang resulta: kakarampot ang trabahong nalilikha. Dinatnan nating tigang sa pag-asa ang mamamayang Pilipino. Marami sa atin ang sumuko at napilitang makipagsapalaran sa ibang bansa. Nakayuko na lamang nating tinanggap: Talagang wala tayong maaasahan sa ating pamahalaan at lipunan.
Nalugmok nga po ang Pilipinas dahil sa labis na pamumulitika. Naglaho ang pananalig natin sa isa’t isa, humina ang kumpiyansa sa atin ng mundo, at ang pinakamasakit: Nawalan tayo ng tiwala sa ating mga sarili.
Sa puntong ito natin sinimulan ang pagtahak sa tuwid na daan.
Bilang ama ng bayan, nakaatang sa aking balikat, hindi lang ang mga suliraning ating dinatnan at mga lumilitaw sa kasalukuyan—obligasyon ko ring paghandaan ang kinabukasan. Sa bawat sandali, kailangan kong isaalang-alang ang interes at punto-de-bista ng lahat. Isipin na lang po ninyo: Para kang nanonood ng 200 channel sa telebisyon nang sabay-sabay. Kailangan, alam mo, hindi lang ang kasalukuyang nagaganap, kundi ang pinanggalingan at paroroonan ng nilalaman ng bawat channel. Bawal malito, at kailangan, may tugon ka sa anumang tanong, suhestiyon, at kritisismo—at dapat sagutin mo ito, bago pa iharap sa iyo. Hindi po madali ang trabahong ito, at tao lang po ako, na kung minsan, nagkakaroon din ng agam-agam.
Ngunit buo ang aking loob dahil malinaw ang aking pangunahing layunin: Ang ibalik ang gobyerno sa dapat nitong tuon—ang paglingkuran ang taumbayan sa lahat ng panahon. [Palakpakan]
‘Di po ba’t may kasabihan tayo: Bigyan mo ng isda ang tao, at mapapakain mo siya ng isang araw. Turuan mo siyang mangisda, at habambuhay niyang mapapakain ang sarili niya. Halimbawa nito ay ang TESDA. Sa Training-for-Work Scholarship Program, nag-ambag ang DAP ng 1.6 billion pesos. Nakapagpatapos po ito ng 223,615 benepisyaryo. 66 percent po nito—o katumbas ng 146,731 graduates—ang nagtatrabaho na ngayon. Iyon naman pong 34 percent na natitira, tinutulungan na rin ng TESDA na makahanap ng trabaho. Tingnan po ninyo: Lahat po ng mga TESDA scholar, nakalista ang pangalan at iba pang datos, na puwede ninyong kumpirmahin. [Palakpakan]
Kung hahatiin natin sa bilang ng graduates ang naipagkaloob na pondo, pumapatak ng 7,155 pesos ang naipuhunan ng pamahalaan para sa training ng bawat scholar. Sa BPO sector, mababa na ang kitang 18,000 piso kada buwan. Kada taon, kikita siya ng 234,000 pesos. Ibigay man ang maximum tax deduction, ang magiging income tax niya kada taon: 7,900 pesos. Ibig-sabihin, ang pinuhunan ng estadong 7,155 pesos, sa unang taon pa lang, nabawi na, may sobra pa. Ito, at ang lahat ng ibubuwis ng ating scholar hanggang magretiro siya, ay magbibigay naman sa kanyang kababayan ng parehong pagkakataon. Ito po ang mabuting pamamahala [Palakpakan]: May tama pong intensyon, pamamaraan, at resulta. Lahat panalo.
Pakinggan po natin ang kuwento ng dalawang TESDA graduate:

“‘Pag naabot mo na ‘yong pangarap mo—success, hindi naman stable ‘yon e. You need to work hard for it.
“Ako po si Marc Joseph Escora. Ako po ay isang high school graduate. And through TESDA’s help, I have my career in the BPO [business process outsourcing] industry right now.
“I stayed in Libertad public market for seven years. Nagba-barker po ako. Hindi kaya ng pamilya ko na pag-aralin kami nang sabay, so I need to find another way para makapagtapos ako.
“Most important thing na natutunan ko is ‘yung confidence to interact with other people.  ‘Pag nakita ka ng tao na may kapansanan ka, hindi na nila ni-look forward ‘yung ability mo ba. Kailangan lang natin ng tiwala sa sarili.
“If TESDA is not there to help out, siguro wala rin ako ngayon kung nasaan man ako ngayon. ‘Yung way of living namin, masasabi kong mas okay siya compared noong dati.”
– Marc Joseph Escora, TESDA beneficiary [panoorin ang video]
“Dahil sa TESDA, napabilis ‘yung pag-aaral ko, paghahanap ko ng trabaho, at ang pagtulong ko sa pamilya ko.
“Ako po si Jonnalyn Navarossa, Technical Trainer ng Toyota Motor Philippines. Ako po ‘yung naging overall topnotcher ng batch 1 sa automotive servicing sa TESDA Region 8. Napili ko po ‘yung automotive servicing kasi po pangarap kong maging isang mechanical engineer. So para makapagtrabaho’t magkapag-ipon, nag-TESDA po ako.
“Nakasanayan na po natin na ang auto mechanic ay trabahong panlalaki lang. Pero napatunayan ko na basta masipag at determinado, magkakaroon tayo ng dekalidad na produkto. Dahil sa TESDA, tumatak po sa akin ang kahalagahan ng dekalidad at mahusay na pagtatrabaho. Mas tumaas ‘yung tiwala ko sa aking sarili, at mas masarap nang mangarap nang malaki.”
– Jonnalyn Navarossa, TESDA beneficiary [panoorin ang video]

[Palakpakan]
Nasimulan na rin po natin ang Expanded Conditional Cash Transfer Program nitong Hunyo 2014, na may pondong 12.3 billion pesos. Ngayon, suportado na rin ng estado hanggang umabot ng 18 taong gulang ang benepisyaryo. May magtatanong, “Bakit?” Batay po kasi sa pag-aaral ng Philippine Institute for Development Studies, 40 percent ang dagdag na sinasahod ng high school graduate, kumpara sa grade school lang ang natapos.
Namumuhunan po tayo sa pinakamahalagang yaman ng bansa: ang taumbayan. Pinapatunayan ito ng datos ng NEDA. Ayon sa kanila, ang 27.9 percent na poverty incidence natin sa unang semester ng 2012, bumaba patungong 24.9 percent sa kaparehong panahon noong 2013. Ang three percentage points pong ito ay katumbas ng halos 2.5 milyon na Pilipinong nakaalpas na sa poverty line. [Palakpakan] Totoo namang dapat pagtuunan ng masusing pansin ang pinakamahihirap sa lipunan. Pero hindi tayo titigil diyan: Ngayong nadagdagan ang kakayahan natin, sinisikap nating hindi na manumbalik sa ilalim ng poverty line ang lahat ng nakaalpas na. [Palakpakan]
Dumating po tayo sa lipunang parang isang sirang bahay na hindi natin malisan. Ang malala pa dito, halos wala tayong kagamitan at materyales para ayusin ang sira. Nitong mga nakaraang taon, sa pakikiambag ng bawat mapagkapwang Pilipino, nabubuo na natin ang mga kagamitan at materyales na ito—tulad po ng budget na tanging nakatuon sa pangangailangan ng mamamayan, at apat na sunud-sunod na taon na nating naipapasa sa tamang oras. Kasama nito ang mga batas na nagpapabilis ng pagdating ng pakinabang sa atin pong mga Boss.
Dito po—sa isang patas na sistema—nagsimula ang panunumbalik ng sigla ng ating ekonomiya. Nakatipid tayo dahil sa maayos na pangangasiwa ng pondo. Napapalawak natin ang saklaw ng mga serbisyo nang hindi nagtataas ng buwis, maliban sa Sin Tax Reform na layuning ibsan ang bisyo sa lipunan. [Palakpakan]
Nagtrabaho tayo para magkaroon ng kakayahang tustusan ang mga proyektong ipinatupad, ipinatutupad, at ipatutupad pa natin. Pinaigting natin ang pangongolekta ng buwis: mula sa koleksyong 1.094 trillion pesos noong 2010, naitaas na natin ito sa 1.536 trillion noong 2013.  [Palakpakan] Inayos natin ang pamamahala ng ating mga utang. Ang resulta: Bumaba ang ating debt to GDP ratio; ang perang dating dapat ibabayad sa interes, napupunta na sa social services. Pati ang mga obligasyong karamihan ay minana lang, natugunan din natin. Halimbawa po nito: 1993 pa po o panahon pa ni Pangulong Ramos nang itinakda ang obligasyong i-recapitalize ang Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas sa halagang 50 bilyong piso para magawa niya ang kanyang tungkulin. Ang napondohan ni Presidente Ramos, 10 bilyong piso, at hindi na nadagdagan pagkatapos noon. 40 bilyon ang kakulangang iniwan sa atin; nabayaran na po natin ito. [Palakpakan]
Pinaghirapan natin ang pondong mayrooon tayo ngayon, kaya’t hindi po natin maaatim na waldasin lang ito. Kung pipili nga ng tamang pinuno ang ating mga Boss, malalagpasan pa ng susunod ang ating mga nagawa, dahil malaki na ang naibawas natin sa problema, at mas matayog na ang kanilang pagmumulan.
Bakit po mas matayog? Nitong 2013, sa unang pagkakataon, nagkamit tayo ng investment grade status mula sa Moody’s, sa Fitch, at Standard and Poor’s—ang tatlong pinakatanyag na credit ratings agency sa mundo. Sa pagsusuri nila ng ating macroenomic fundamentals at governance, nabawasan ang riskong itinatala, kaya tumingkad ang kumpiyansa ng mga namumuhunan. Hindi pa nga po nakuntento ang Standard and Poor’s: Nitong Mayo lang, panibagong upgrade na naman ang ibinigay nila sa atin. Ang hatid po nito: Dahil nga investment grade na tayo, mas murang mahihiram ng gobyerno ang pondo para sa mga programa at proyekto, mas maraming naaakit na mamumuhunan sa ating bansa, at mas mabilis na natatamasa ng Pilipino ang benepisyo. [Palakpakan]
Kung susumahin naman po ang lahat ng puhunang pumasok sa Philippine Economic Zone Authority simula nang itatag ito noong 1995, makikitang 42 porsyento ang pumasok sa apat na taon ng ating panunungkulan. Ang natitirang 58 percent, inabot ng 15 taon ang ibang mga administrasyon para bunuin. Kumpiyansa po tayo: bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto, papantayan o hihigitan pa natin ang halagang ito. Kay Director General Lilia de Lima: Salamat sa nagawa mo na, at gagawin pa, sa pagkamit ng tagumpay na ito. [Palakpakan]
Talagang pa-take-off na ang ating ekonomiya at bansa, at inaabot na natin ang mas matatayog pang mithiin. Minana natin ang tila grounded na aviation industry: napatawan tayo ng significant safety concerns ng International Civil Aviation Organization, o ICAO, nabigyan ng downgrade ng United States Federal Aviation Administration, at nilagyan ng restriction ng European Union ang ating mga local carriers.
Nitong 2013, inalis na nga po ng ICAO ang significant safety concerns sa Pilipinas. Sa parehong taon, sinundan ito ng pagpayag ng European Union na muling lumipad ang Philippine Airlines patungong Europa, kaya direkta nang makakabiyahe ang Pilipino [Palakpakan]  mula Maynila po hanggang London. Malamang nga po, pasunod na ang Cebu Pacific dahil nabigyan na rin sila ng pahintulot ng EU ngayong 2014. Ngayong taon din, in-upgrade ng United States Federal Aviation Administration ang Pilipinas balik sa Category 1. Dahil dito, maaari nang dumagdag ang mga ruta papunta sa Estados Unidos. Sa larangan ng turismo at pangangalakal, malaki ang itinulong ng pagdami ng flights ng ating airlines tungo sa mga bansa kasapi ng EU at Estados Unidos .
Dumarating sa atin ang mga ulat na sa dami ng gustong bumisitang negosyante at turista sa ating bansa, dumarating ang mga panahong kulang na ang mga biyahe papunta rito. Magandang balita nga po ang mga upgrade: Dadami ang biyahe, kaya’t matutugunan ang suliraning ito. At sa patuloy na pagtutulungan ng CAAP at ng ating mga local carrier, pihadong mas marami pa tayong maaakit na turista at negosyante sa mga susunod na taon. Panalo ang mga umaasa sa sektor ng turismo, panalo ang sambayanang Pilipino. Mabuting pamamahala po ang ugat ng mga tagumpay na ito. Nagpapasalamat nga tayo kina Director General William Hotchkiss, sa CAAP, at sa ating mga local carriers para sa inyong pagsusumikap. [Palakpakan]
Talagang nasa sentro ng pandaigdigang entablado ang Pilipinas. Nito lang pong nakaraang Mayo, nagpakitang-gilas tayo sa tagumpay ng pagdaraos ng World Economic Forum on East Asia sa ating bansa. Ihahayag natin sa gaganaping APEC Summit dito sa susunod na taon ang kaunlarang nakakamit natin at ang pagkakataong hatid nito para sa lahat. Wala pong duda: More open for business na nga po ang Pilipinas. [Palakpakan]
Bukod po sa maaliwalas na pagnenegosyo, isinusulong din natin ang maayos na relasyon ng ating mga manggagawa at mga kompanya.
Isipin po ninyo: Mula 2010, nananatiling mababa sa sampu ang bilang ng mga strike kada taon ayon sa National Conciliation and Mediation Board. Isa po itong positibong bunga ng itinataguyod nating Single Entry Approach, o SEnA, ng DOLE, kung saan dumadaan sa 30-day conciliation-mediation ang mga nakahaing labor cases. Ang maganda nga po: sa 115 notices of strike and lockout noong 2013, isa lang ang natuloy na welga. Ito ang pinakamababa sa kasaysayan ng DOLE. Maraming salamat po kay Secretary Linda Baldoz, sa pamilya ng DOLE [palakpakan] at siyempre po sa labor at management sectors. Minsan po ay nagkabiruan kami ni Secretary Baldoz, noong 2012 ho yata’y  may dalawang strike, noong 2013, isa na lang, so nangangalahati nang nangangalahati. Sabi ko: Linda, sa 2014, hindi tagumpay ‘yung may kalahating strike. Baka puwede, wala nang strike? [Tawanan at palakpakan]
Batid rin natin: Para magpatuloy ang pag-angat ng ekonomiya at pagbukas ng pagkakataon, kailangan ng imprastruktura. Ito ang aakit sa mga negosyante, magpapabilis sa daloy ng produkto at serbisyo, at sisigurong kaya nating makipagsabayan sa iba pang merkado sa daigdig.
Napakalaki po talaga ng pagbabago: Lampas doble na ang budget para sa imprastruktura, mula 200.3 billion pesos noong 2011, naging 404.3 billion pesos ngayong 2014. [Palakpakan] Paalala ko lang po: Hindi tayo nagdagdag ng buwis maliban sa Sin Tax Reform na nakatugon sa kalusugan, habang napanatili din ang ating allowable deficit, at patuloy na bumababa ang ating debt-to-GDP ratio. Malaki po ang epekto nito, dahil hindi lang lumaki ang pondo: binawasan pa natin ang mga tagas sa sistema, kaya natitiyak nating mas sulit ang bawat pisong ginagastos ng estado.
Sa pamumuno ni Secretary Babes Singson ng DPWH: Bawal ang tongpats, bawal ang bukol. Tinapalan na ang mga butas sa lumang sistema, at pinatag ang proseso sa ahensya. Isang simpleng halimbawa po nito ang pagtatanggal ng Letter of Intent sa bidding process. Noon po kasi, ginagamit ito bilang kasangkapan sa kuntsabahan—kapag nalaman kung sino-sino ang bidders ng proyekto, binibigyan ng puwang ang sabwatan. Isa pa po: Ang mga dokumentong hinihiling mula sa bidders: lima na lang, mula sa dating 20. Mas mabilis ang proseso, at mas kaunti ang pagkakataong manghingi ng pampadulas o suhol. Ang resulta: Halos 28 bilyong piso ang naisalbang pondo, at napapaaga ang pagpapatupad ng mga susunod na proyekto. [Palakpakan] Kaya naman kay Sec. Babes at sa bumubuo ng DPWH: muli, maraming salamat po sa inyong lahat. [Palakpakan]
Hanep po talaga: Kasabay ng mga natipid ng DPWH, ang nailatag, napapaayos, napalawak, o naipagawa nilang kalsada mula nang maupo tayo, umabot na sa 12,184 kilometro. [Palakpakan] Nung nakita ko po itong numerong ‘to, napag-isip rin ako: Paano ko ba maipapaliwanag ‘yung labindalawang libo? Sabi po sa atin: katumbas ito ng apat na kalsadang nag-uugnay sa Laoag hanggang Zamboanga City. National roads lang po ito; wala pa rito ang mga local farm-to-market roads o tourism roads. [Palakpakan]
Sa Public-Private Partnership program naman po: Mula Disyembre 2011 hanggang nitong Hunyo, nakapag-award at nakalagda na ng pitong PPP projects ang inyong pamahalaan; ang halaga nito: tinatayang 62.6 billion pesos. Sa apat na taon natin sa tuwid na daan, nalampasan na natin ang pinagsamang anim lamang na aprubadong solicited PPP projects mula sa nakaraang tatlong administrasyon. [Palakpakan]
Ang laki na po talaga ng pinagkaiba ng noon sa ngayon. Sabi nga ni Secretary Cesar Purisima: Dati, hindi makaakit ang Pilipinas ng mga mamumuhunan. Noon, gobyerno pa mismo ang nag-aalay ng kaliwa’t kanang insentibo, tulad ng pagbibigay ng commercial development rights, subsidy, at iba pang garantiya. Ngayon, baliktad na ang sitwasyon. Matindi ang kompetisyon ng mga nag-uunahang kompanya; handa silang magbayad para makuha ang pribilehiyong itayo ang imprastrukturang kailangan natin. Halimbawa po: Sa Mactan-Cebu International Airport Passenger Terminal Building, may premium ang gobyerno na umaabot sa mahigit 14 bilyong piso; sa NAIA Expressway Project Phase 2, nakakuha ang gobyerno ng prima na 11 bilyong piso. Muli: Mabuting pamamahala ang ugat ng lahat ng ito. [Palakpakan]
Tingnan naman natin ang TPLEX. Dahil sa kalsadang ito, maginhawa na ang biyaheng Tarlac hanggang Rosales sa Pangasinan. Ayon po sa kanila, ang bahagi hanggang Urdaneta, makukumpleto na bago matapos ang 2014. Sa susunod na taon, aabot na raw ang daang ito hanggang sa dulo sa Rosario,  La Union. [Palakpakan]
Ang mga imprastrukturang matagal nang ipinako sa pangako, atin na rin pong isinasakongkreto. Ang Aluling Bridge, na 1978 pa po binuo ang konsepto, bukas na sa publiko. Ang Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, na bahagi ng Metro Manila Expressway na proyekto pa noong dekada sitenta, inilunsad na natin noong Enero. Sa mga dumadaan ng Osmeña Highway, nakikita naman po ninyo kung gaano kabilis itayo ang mga haligi para dito. Ang Ternate-Nasugbu Road, na noon pang 1994 sinimulang ilatag ang plano—100 percent complete na rin ngayon. [Palakpakan] Ang Basilan Circumferential Road, na year 2000 pang under construction, malapit na rin pong matapos. Hindi ko na ho sasabihin ‘yung eksaktong petsa baka mausog pa. Pero ‘pag hindi ho natupad, ‘yung ipinangako sa atin ni Governor Hataman, sasamahan ko siya araw-araw hanggang matapos ito.
Ilan lang po ito sa mga imprastrukturang wala tayong planong ipamana bilang problema; sa halip, ngayon, nagsisimula na itong mapakinabangan ng ating mga Boss.
Muli, dahil sa mabuting pamamahala, mas may kakayahan na tayong tugunan, maging ang mga problemang paparating pa lang. Halimbawa: sa tubig. Alam nating habang lumalago ang populasyon at umaangat ang ekonomiya, mas maraming tubig ang kakailanganin sa mga susunod na taon. Ayon nga po sa pag-aaral, maaaring magkaroon ng kakulangan ng tubig sa Metro Manila pagdating ng 2021. Hindi na po natin hihintayin ang tagtuyot: Ang mga solusyong talagang pinag-aralan ng mga dalubhasa, inaprubahan na po natin—ang Kaliwa Dam Project sa Quezon, at ang pag-aayos ng mga linya ng Angat Dam. Magandang solusyon po ito kaysa kumuha ng tubig mula sa mga aquifer sa ilalim ng lupa, na mas madaling pasukin o magbibigay-daan para mas madaling pasukan ng tubig-alat. Isa pa, kung sa mga aquifer lang tayo nakasalalay, mas mapapabilis ang paglubog ng lupa—na siya namang nagiging dahilan ng pagbaha.
Kasabay po ng mga dam para sa Metro Manila at mga karatig-bayan ang suporta natin sa mga tagalalawigan. Aprubado na rin ang Water District Development Sector Project, sa ilalim ng LWUA o Local Water Utilities Administration. [Palakpakan]
Siguro po, narinig na rin ninyo ang pinakamalaki nating PPP project—ang Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike—bubuksan na rin ang bidding bago matapos ang 2014. [Palakpakan] Napakaraming benepisyong maidudulot nito. Una, mababawasan ang pagbaha. Ngayon po, ‘pag pumalo ng 12.5 meters ang taas ng tubig sa lawa, tiyak, babahain na ang mga komunidad sa paligid nito. Ang solusyon: dikeng may taas na higit sa 15 metro. Ikalawa  pong pakinabang: Malilinis ang tubig sa Laguna Lake. Ang ikatlo po: Bawas ang trapiko. Sa ibabaw ng dike, magkakaroon ng expressway, na babagtas sa Los Baños hanggang Taguig. ‘Pag natapos ang C-6 road na kokonekta sa San Jose del Monte, may isa na naman tayong paraan upang makatawid ng Kamaynilaan nang hindi na kakailanganing dumaan sa EDSA. [Palakpakan] Sa pakikituwang ng pribadong sektor, ang obligasyon natin dito ay right of way lang; porsyento ng lupang mare-reclaim ang ipapambayad sa mananalong bidder. Dahil dito, makukuha natin ang ating mga pangangailangan, habang mababawasan din ang ating gastusin.
Ilang halimbawa lang po iyan ng mga proyektong nakapila na para magdala ng benepisyo sa ating mga Boss. Marami pang iba: Aprubado na rin ng NEDA Board ang Laoag City Bypass Link Road Project; ang Cebu Bus Rapid Transit Project; at ang LRT Line 1 South Extension and Line 2 East Extension. Sa mga taga-Palawan naman: Maliban sa mga proyekto sa Puerto Princesa Airport, abangan na rin ninyo ang Busuanga Airport. Naka-go signal na rin po ang pagpapatayo ng phase one ng modernong Clark Green City sa Capas, Tarlac, pihado pong magsisilbing sentro ng komersyo at industriya, hindi lang sa Gitnang Luzon, kundi sa kalakhang bansa. [Palakpakan] Sa dulo po, ang ambisyon natin sa Clark Green City—maging di-hamak itong mas malawak na Bonifacio Global City. Ang dating liblib, magiging hitik sa oportunidad.
Sa mabuting pamamahala, nanunumbalik ang tiwala ng merkado, ng mundo, at ng taumbayan sa ating gobyerno. Nagbubunsod ito ng isang siklo: Dahil nakikita ang resulta ng agenda ng reporma, nakikiambag ang bawat isa sa ating mga Boss. Talagang hindi nag-iisa ang gobyerno sa pagsusulong ng malawakan at makabuluhang reporma. Totoo nga po: Kayo ang aming lakas. [Palakpakan]
Kaya nga po, mga Boss: Salamat sa inyong tiwala at pakikiisa, na lalong nagiging mahalaga sa mga panahong sinalubong tayo ng sunud-sunod na trahedya.
Noong Setyembre 2013, sinugod ng masasamang elemento ang Zamboanga: Ginawang human shield ang mga kababayan nating namumuhay nang mapayapa, at sinunog pa ang kanilang mga tahanan. Nasubukan ang galing ng ating unipormadong hanay. Pinakamasalimuot sa larangan ng bakbakan ang tinatawag na urban combat—ngunit 195 ang nailigtas natin, sa 197 kataong naipit sa putukan. Saludo tayo sa ating mga kapatid sa unipormadong hanay: Nagtagumpay ang sambayanan dahil sa inyong sakripisyo. [Palakpakan]
Inatasan po natin si Secretary Singson na pangasiwaan ang rehabilitasyon ng imprastrukturang nasira sa Zamboanga. Pangunahin sa mga pangangailangan: mabigyan ng tahanan ang mga kababayan nating nasunugan. Ito po mismo ang isinasagawa natin sa ilalim ng Zamboanga City Roadmap to Recovery and Reconstruction. Pagpasok nga po ng Agosto, magsisimula nang lumipat ang mga apektadong pamilya sa mga permanenteng bahay sa Martha Drive Subdivision. Kabuuang 7,176 na kabahayan sa iba’t ibang lugar ang target nating makumpleto sa Hunyo ng susunod na taon. Humihingi po kami ng pang-unawa. Maraming problemang kinailangan munang lutasin ukol sa pagkuha ng lupang lilipatan. Tinitiyak din nating ang mga tahanang ito ay sumasang-ayon sa pangangailangan ng kanilang relihiyon at kultura, kaya’t hindi pangkaraniwan ang mga ito. Sa 1,661 pamilya namang gustong sila mismo ang magkumpuni ng sariling tahanan, 30,000 pisong halaga ng Home Materials Assistance ang ipinapamahagi na.
3.5 billion pesos po ang nakahanda para sa pagpapaayos ng imprastruktura, pagbili ng mga lote, pagpapatayo ng mga permanenteng tahanan, at iba pang suporta sa Zamboanga. 2.57 billion pesos dito, nai-release na sa NHA at DPWH.
Ilang linggo naman po matapos ang krisis sa Zamboanga, niyanig ng lindol ang Central Visayas; pinakamalaki ang pinsala sa Bohol. Dito natin nakita ang maaaring maabot ng sambayanang nagkakaisa sa pagresponde sa sakuna. Isang linggo matapos ang lindol, may kuryente na sa Tagbilaran at sa lahat ng munisipalidad ng Bohol. [Palakpakan]
Ngayon nga po, bawat isa sa 25 na kritikal na tulay at kalsadang nasira ng lindol, nadadaanan na. May kabuuang 3.583 billion pesos nang nai-release para sa rehabilitasyon ng Bohol at Cebu. [Palakpakan] Kasama na rito ang 2.49 billion pesos na ipinagkaloob ng DILG sa lokal na gobyerno, para sa pagpapagawa ng mga palengke, civic center, tulay, water systems, munisipyo at ibang pang istrukturang pampamahalaan.
Bago naman po matapos ang 2013, dumating naman si Yolanda— ang pinakamalakas na bagyo sa kasaysayan. 1.47 milyong pamilya ang talagang naapektuhan, at 44 sa ating 81 probinsya ang tinamaan. Sa Eastern Visayas, kung saan pinakamalakas ang pinsalang nadulot, napakaraming kinailangan na agarang lingap.
Sa sobrang lakas ng bagyo, naparalisa ang maraming LGU dahil sila mismo ang tinamaan. Natangay po pati ang ating prepositioned relief goods, kaya’t talagang kinailangang manggaling sa ibang lugar ang tulong. Lalo pang naging mabigat ang pagdadala ng ayuda, dahil bagsak ang imprastruktura: Walang kuryente, hindi madaanan ang kalsada, at halos lahat ng truck at heavy equipment na kailangan ng ating first responders ay nasira sa pinakaapektadong mga lugar. Wala ring gasolina, at walang komunikasyon.
Kinailangan po talaga ng pambihirang pagkakaisa para ipaabot ang tulong sa mga apektadong pamilya, kalingahin ang mga naulila’t sugatan, siguruhing walang mangyayaring outbreak ng sakit, at marami pang ibang tungkulin. Halimbawa lang po: Sa pagkain, hindi lang bigas at delata ang kinailangang intindihin. Kailangan din ng mga repacking center, ng maraming truck, pati na ang mga barkong magtatawid ng ayuda sa mga apektadong probinsya. Pagdating doon ng relief goods, kailangang malinis na ang kalsadang dadaanan, at mapagasolinahan ang mga truck nang makabalik sila sa pinanggalingan, upang muling makapagkarga ng ating mga food pack.
Hindi nagpatumpik-tumpik sa pagresponde ang inyong gobyerno. Nagmadali tayong linisin, unang-una, ang airport, kaya sa loob ng 24 oras pagkatapos ng bagyo, nakapasok na ang tatlo nating C130 na may dalang ayuda. Sa mismong araw ding iyon, nakapagtayo tayo ng communications hub para maging mas mabilis ang daloy ng impormasyon. Sa ikalawang araw, dumating na ang Rapid Health Assessment teams ng DOH; ang dagdag na sundalo, pulis, at BFP personnel mula sa ibang probinsya; pati na mga kawani ng DSWD na nanguna sa relief operations— sa distribution centers man sa Eastern Visayas, o sa maraming repacking centers na agad na nagbukas sa buong bansa.
Sa loob lang ng dalawang araw, napagana na ang Leyte water district; sa ikatlong araw naman, bumukas ang unang gasolinahan. Agad na nilinis ang pangunahing mga kalsada. Pagsapit ng ika-22 ng Nobyembre o dalawang linggo matapos ang bagyo, naipamahagi na ang ikaisang milyong food pack sa mga nasalanta; na-clear na ang 35,162 cubic meters ng debris sa mga kalsadang pagdadaanan nitong mga relief; at nalinis at nadaanan na ring muli ang 3,426 kilometers ng National Roads—kasalukuyan naman po nating kinukumpuni ang 108.8 kilometrong napinsalang daanan, tulay, approaches, at landslide-prone areas. Pagsapit nga po ng Pasko noong lumipas ang 2013, may kuryente na sa lahat ng munisipalidad na tinamaan ng sakuna. [Palakpakan]
Kumbaga nga po sa Emergency Room, ibinuhos ng estado ang lahat ng kanyang kapangyarihan upang agad na mai-stabilize ang pasyente. Nagpapasalamat tayo sa mga kasapi sa ating Gabinete, na talaga naman pong nanguna sa pagresponde sa mga apektadong komunidad. Sina Sec. Cesar Purisima at Sec. Joel Villanueva ng TESDA, na namuno sa logistics at nag-organisa sa mga repacking center, nagmistulan po silang dalawang warehouse operator. [Palakpakan] Si Sec. Greg Domingo ng DTI, naging head purchasing agent ng bansa, habang si Sec. Linda Baldoz naman ng DOLE ay minabuting maging call center operator para sa lahat ng gusto o nag-aalok ng tulong. [Palakpakan] Salamat din kina Sec. Jun Abaya ng DOTC, na naging dispatcher ng ating transportasyon; kay Sec. Dinky Soliman na talagang pinatunayan ang pagiging punong relief worker ng bansa; at kina Sec. Mar Roxas ng DILG at Sec. Volts Gazmin ng DND, na nagbigay ng marching orders sa ating unipormadong hanay mula sa frontline ng sakuna. [Palakpakan] Muli po, salamat sa ating Gabinete.
To our friends and neighbors around the world: Your outpouring of solidarity will never be forgotten by a grateful Filipino people. Again, on their behalf, we thank you. [Palakpakan]
Marahil nga po, sa kahandaan nating makiambag sa abot ng ating makakaya, na siyang ipinapamalas ng ating OFWs, peacekeepers, at iba pang Pilipino sa labas ng bansa, nang tayo naman ang nangailangan, nakita ng mundong karapat-dapat din tayong tulungan. Salamat sa inyo, at sa lahat ng Pilipinong nag-alay ng dalangin at suporta, dito man o sa ibang panig ng mundo.  [Palakpakan]
Hindi po natigil ang trabaho natin. Nagsagawa tayo ng livelihood interventions, upang maging mas mabilis ang pagbangon ng mga nasalanta nating kababayan. Ngayong Hulyo nga po, 221,897 trabaho na ang nalikha matapos tayong magkaloob ng bangka, kagamitan sa pangingisda at pagtatanim, mga binhi, at livestock. Kasama na rin po dito ang mga sinuwelduhan nating naging kabahagi ng cash for work program.
Tanggap naman po siguro ng lahat na malaki ang problemang dala ni Yolanda. Pero ayon nga po sa international standards, kapag nangyari ang ganitong klaseng sakuna, isang taon ang inaabot bago matapos ang relief at mag-umpisa ang rehabilitasyon ng isang bansa. Pero sa loob lang ng walong buwan, idineklara na ng United Nations mismo na nasa yugto na tayo ng rehabilitation. Si Ginoong Yuri Afanasiev ng United Nations Development Programme na nga po ang nagsabi: “We have never seen a recovery happen so quickly. And many of us have been in many different disasters.” [Palakpakan]
Mahabang panahon ang bubunuin para tuluyang makabangon sa mabibigat na sakuna. Sa Haiti, dalawang taon ang nakalipas mula ng lindol, marami pa rin ang nasa evacuation centers. Ang mga kapatid natin sa Indonesia, inabot ng walong taon para maka-recover sa tsunami sa Aceh. Mismong sa Amerika nga po, sinasabing walong taon ang inabot para makabalik sa dati matapos humagupit si Hurricane Katrina.
Hindi pa po tapos ang ating trabaho. Marami pang bahay na kailangang ipatayo; marami pang mga kababayan natin ang kailangang ibangong muli; patuloy pa rin ang pag-build back better para sa mga hinagupit ni Yolanda.
Kaya nga po: Ngayong Hulyo, isinumite na sa atin, at nilagdaan na rin natin, ang LGU Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan para sa Cebu, Iloilo, Samar, Eastern Samar, Leyte, at Tacloban City. [Palakpakan] Pumasa po ito sa masusing pagsusuri ng mga cluster ng Gabinete; laman nito ang mga pangangailangan ng ating mga kababayan, ayon na rin sa isinasagawang malawakang post-disaster needs assessment. Nabuo po ang planong ito sa maigting na pagsisikap ni Secretary Ping Lacson, na inatasan nga nating tumutok sa mga hamong iniwan ni Yolanda. [Palakpakan] Umaasa po ako sa pakikiisa ng Kongreso, dahil malaking halaga ang kailangan, upang tuluyan nang maibangon ang ating mga kababayan.
Alalahanin po natin: Nasa Diyos ang awa; nasa tao ang gawa. Ito rin ang parehong ideya sa likod ng ating mga hakbang para sa disaster preparedness. Binigyang-lakas natin ang mga LGU na siyang mga frontliner tuwing bagyo at  iba pang sakuna, gamit ang moderno at malawakang forecasting system.
Sa DREAM-LiDAR project sa ilalim ng Project NOAH, halimbawa, napapadali ang pagtukoy kung saan ang mga lugar na pinakababahain. Nakamapa na po ang 19 sa target nating 20 river systems para matukoy kung ano ang mga lugar na agad naaapektuhan tuwing bumubuhos ang ulan.
Dahil mas eksakto na ang pagtukoy natin kung kailan at saan tatama ang epekto ng bagyo, ngayon po, napapaaga ang paghahanda at pagbibigay-babala ng ating mga LGUs. Maaga na ring naililikas ang kanilang mamamayan. Kung ang maayos na forecasting, tatambalan pa natin ng mahusay na LGU, talaga naman pong maraming buhay ang maililigtas. Sa Albay na hinagupit kamakailan lang ng bagyong Glenda, walang naitalang pumanaw dahil sa bagyo, salamat sa mabuting pamamahala ni Governor Joey Salceda. [Palakpakan] At kung kaya itong gawin ng isang probinsya na siya ngang parang natawag na nga pong highway ng mga bagyo, bakit naman tayo magdududa na kakayanin ng iba pang hindi highway ng bagyo?
Pag-usapan naman natin ang seguridad. Mulat po tayo sa mga hamon sa bansa, at alam din nating mahal ang kailangan nating mga kagamitan. Ngayon po, ikinalulugod kong iulat sa inyo: Tuloy-tuloy ang modernisasyon ng AFP. Nakuha na natin ang brand new na 8 Sokol Combat Utility Helicopters, tatlong AgustaWestland-109 helicopters, at ang kauna-unahang landing craft utility ship na ginawa dito mismo sa ating bansa, ang BRP Tagbanua. Dumating na rin po ang apat na refurbished UH-1 helicopters at 2 navy cutters. Nito namang nakaraang Mayo, pinasinayaan na rin natin ang state-of-the-art Command Center ng Naval Forces West sa Palawan.
Sa susunod na taon, lalapag na ang 2 sa 12 na FA-50 lead-in fighter trainer jets na binili natin. [Palakpakan] Ang natitira naman po, inaasahan nating maide-deliver bago matapos ang 2017. Target din nating makuha ang karagdagang brand new na 8 Bell combat utility helicopters, 2 anti-submarine helicopters, 10 pang AgustaWestland-109 helicopters, 2 light-lift aircraft, 3 medium-lift aircraft, mga radar system at iba pang kagamitang magpapaunlad sa kakayahan ng ating Sandatahang Lakas. [Palakpakan] Samantala po, sa Setyembre ng taong ito, inaasahan ang pagdating ng karagdagang 17 refurbished UH-1 helicopters.
Dumating na rin ang paunang mga M4 assault rifles na binili natin para sa kasundaluhan. Sa mga susunod na buwan, ang kabuuang bilang ng baril na mapapasakamay ng ating mga kawal: 50,629 units ng M4. Ang bonus pa: dahil sa maayos na proseso ng procurement at tapat na pangangasiwa sa pondo, may savings tayo na mahigit 1.2 billion pesos; itong savings ay ipinambibili na natin ng mas marami pang baril. [Palakpakan]
Ididiin ko lang po: Brand new at dekalidad ang lahat ng ripleng ito na nagmumula sa manufacturer na daang taon na pong gumagawa ng sandata. ‘Di po ba noong araw: naubos na nga ang pondo, hindi pa alinsunod sa ispesipikasyong kailangan natin, tulad po ng biniling Kevlar Helmets. Sabi po ng ispesipikasyon, dapat sa U.S. Pero noong ibinili, sa ibang bansa. May na-convict na po dahil dito. Pati ang isang hukom na diumano’y sangkot dito, natapos na ang imbestigasyong inutos ng Korte Suprema, at hinihintay natin ang kanilang pasya.
Tuloy ang pagtugis natin sa kalaban ng estado at masasamang elemento para sa mga krimeng ginawa nila. Halimbawa nga po: Nahuli na ang Chairman at Secretary General ng NPA nitong Marso. Nanunumbalik na rin po ang normalidad at kaayusan sa 31 probinsyang dating ginambala ng NPA.
Nagbabago na rin nga po ang mukha ng ating kapulisan. Patunay po rito ang 30 pulis, sa pangunguna ni Inspector Charity Galvez, na tumalo sa tinatayang 250 NPA na sumugod sa kanilang presinto noong 2011. [Palakpakan] Nitong Marso naman po, 4 na bagitong pulis ang buong-tapang na sumagupa laban sa Martilyo Gang sa Mall of Asia. Mabuti nga po’t naabot na ang 1:1 police to pistol ratio, kaya’t naisyuhan na rin ng bagong baril ang ating mga rookie policewomen. Dati, nakakaligtaan ang kapulisan; ngayon, kinakalinga na sila ng estado, at talaga namang tinutumbasan nila ito ng wagas at masigasig na serbisyo. [Palakpakan]
Pakinggan po natin ang tinig magigiting nating pulis:

“PO1 Juliet Macababbad: May narinig po kaming, ano, nagbasag ng salamin. Naging alerto kami ng buddy ko.
PO1 Marcelina Bantiyag: Ah ‘yong unang pumasok po ng isip ko ‘yung bumunot na po ako ng baril kasi alam ko na ano po sila—na ready po silang magpaputok sa amin; nakauniporme po kami.
PO1 Maricel Rueco: Sinabi po ng aking ka-buddy na si PO1 Bantiyag na “Ko-cover-an kita, ikaw ang tumawag sa ating PCP [Police Community Precinct]!”
PO1 Marcelina Bantiyag: Meron po kaming nahuli na isang miyembro po nila.
PO1 Delia Langpawen: Pang-apat na araw namin ditong duty—doon mismo sa post na ‘yon. Tapos, biglang ganoon po ang nangyari.
PO1 Juliet Macababbad: Kailangan po talaga may baril ‘yung bawat pulis. Mabuti na lang po, may in-issue po sa amin na Glock 17 Generation 4 po.
PO1 Marcelina Bantiyag: Malaking tulong po ‘yung baril sa amin kasi kapag nagpapatrolya ka may confidence ka na kahit may mangyari puwede kang maki-engage.
PO1 Juliet Macababbad: Masarap po sa pakiramdam ‘yung ikaw ay makatulong sa iyong mga kababayan. Kung ano po ‘yung nagagawa ng mga lalaki, nagagawa din po naming mga babae. [Palakpakan]
PO1 Delia Langpawen: Kahit kinabahan po kami dahil first encounter po namin, ang inisip po namin ay ang kapakanan ng mga tao na nandoon.”
– PO1 Juliet Macababbad, PO1 Marcelina Bantiyag, PO1 Maricel Rueco, and PO1 Delia Langpawen—policewomen na umaresto sa miyembro ng Martilyo Gang [panoorin ang video]

Nito naman pong Hunyo, naging sunod-sunod ang high-profile na pamamaslang. Arestado na ang ilangmga sangkot sa pagpatay kina Mayor Ernesto Balolong, sa negosyanteng si Richard King, at may sinusundan na ring magandang lead ang ating kapulisan sa pagpatay sa race car driver na si Ferdinand Pastor. Huwag po kayong mag-alala: hahabulin natin ang hustisya sa kabuuan, hindi ang bahagi lamang. Kaya bukod sa mga ginawa nating pag-aresto, patuloy tayo sa paglikom ng ebidensya laban sa iba pang suspect. Pananagutin natin ang lahat ng may-sala. [Palakpakan]
Pinapaigting pa natin ang pangangalaga sa seguridad ng taumbayan. Simula ng ika-16 ng Hunyo ngayong taon, ipinapatupad natin sa National Capital Region ang Operation Lambat. Matapos nating gawing triple ang dami ng checkpoints at magsagawa ng iba’t ibang operasyon, ang resulta: 862 sasakyan at 29 mga baril ang nakumpiska natin. Nakapag-serve tayo ng 587 warrants of arrest, na nagresulta sa pagkakaaresto ng 410 suspect. Ibinalik din natin ang Oplan Katok para matiyak na ang may tangan ng lisensyadong baril ay ang karapat-dapat lamang. 28,714 na bahay sa NCR ang kinatok ng mga pulis para sa operasyong ito.
Bago natin ipatupad ang Oplan Lambat, mula Enero hanggang ikalawang linggo ng Hunyo, ang murder at homicide sa National Capital Region, umaabot sa 31 kaso kada linggo. Sa limang linggo pa lang ng operasyon, ang murder at homicide rate: Bumaba sa 22 kaso na lamang kada linggo. 29 porsyentong pagbaba ang naitala—katumbas ng 9 na pagpatay ang napigilan natin kada linggo. At sa NCR pa lang po ito. Kung maisasabatas natin ang pension reform, at makakakalap nga tayo ng sapat na pondo para sa dagdag na pulis at para matuloy ang planong pagbili ng kagamitan, lalong mapapalawak ni Sec. Mar Roxas ang Operation Lambat, upang gawing mas ligtas ang buong bansa. [Palakpakan] Nasa ilalim nga po sana ng DAP ang pondong pangkagamitan, pero dahil hindi ito na-obligate bago bumaba ang desisyon ng Korte Suprema, kailangan po nating maghanap ng pagkukunan ng karagdagang pondo.
Tunay nga po: Tiwala ang pundasyon ng mabuting pamamahala. Tiwalang maaasikaso ang lahat ng tinamaan o tatamaan ng bagyo; tiwalang sa bawat araw ng trabaho, ligtas mong mauuwian ang pamilya mo. Tiwala na hindi kayo lalamangan ng inyong mga pinuno; tiwalang nariyan ang inyong gobyerno, kakampi ninyo, lalo na kung kayo ang nadedehado. Tiwala na mananagot ang mga nang-abuso, at maitatama ang mga proseso at institusyong ginagamit para nakawan kayo. Tiwala na kung sumunod ka sa tama, makukuha mo kung ano ang dapat sa iyo. Ang pagbabalik ng tiwala ninyo: Iyan po ang ibig-sabihin ng reporma. [Palakpakan]
Halimbawa po: Sa Customs, na talaga naman pong sinubok ang ating pasensya noong nakaraang mga taon. Naging malinaw sa atin: Reset button ang solusyon. Bumuo po tayo ng mga bagong tanggapan para suriin at gawing epektibo ang mga patakaran sa Customs. Nagtalaga tayo ng bagong commissioner, anim na bagong deputy commissioner, kasabay na rin ang 40 iba pang maaasahang indibidwal para ipatupad ang ating mga reporma sa Customs. Ibinalik din natin sa tamang posisyon ang mga empleyado. Totohanang ipinagbawal ang mga guwardiyang umaastang kahera, o warehouseman na ginagawang examiner.
Marami nga po ang nagsasakripisyo para ayusin ang Customs. Kabilang dito ang mga kawani mula sa ibang departamento at ahensya ng gobyerno, na hiniling nating lumipat sa Customs dahil tiwala tayo sa kanilang integridad. Isipin po ninyo: Sino nga ba naman ang naghahanap ng sakit ng ulo, lalo pa’t walang garantiya ng tagumpay? May mga ipinagpaliban ang kanilang promotion. May mga nagpahiwatig din ng agam-agam dahil sa takot na balikan sila ng mga sindikato. Pero sa huli, tumugon sila sa ating panawagang maglingkod. Marapat lang na personal kong pasalamatan ang lahat ng kawaning ito, sa pangunguna na nga ni Commissioner Sunny Sevilla. [Palakpakan]
Pinapatunayan po natin: Sa paninindigan at pagkakaisa, kayang linisin kahit pa ang isang institusyong napakahabang panahon nang dinungisan ng katiwalian. Patunay po rito ang good news na natanggap natin: Mula Enero hanggang Abril 2014, umangat ng 22 porsyento ang cash collections ng Customs kumpara sa parehong panahon noong nakalipas na taon. Ang kabuuan nilang koleksyon sa unang apat na buwan ng taon: 117 billion pesos. [Palakpakan]
Ang masasabi ko naman sa mga patuloy na rumaraket: Alam kong hindi na kayo tinatablan ng takot at kahihiyan. Nasa inyo kung makukunsensya kayo—o maaawa kayo sa mga nalululong sa drogang pinapapasok o pinahihintulutan ninyong pumasok, o sa mga magsasakang napagkakaitan ng tamang kita. Ang sa akin lang: Kapag sumapat na ang nililikom na ebidensya laban sa inyo, sa Bilibid ang susunod ninyong destino. [Palakpakan]
Kung pag-uusapan natin ang mga repormang nagsisimula nang magbunsod ng malawakang kaunlaran, marapat din pong ibalita ko sa inyo ang mga pangyayari ukol sa repormang agraryo.
Alam naman po natin, at malinaw sa batas: kailangan munang tukuyin ang maaari at hindi maaaring ipamahaging lupain. Pero ang masaklap, ipinamana sa atin ang bungi-bunging datos. Bakit ‘ka niyo? Taong 1913 pa sinimulan ang Cadastral Survey ng ating bansa, na tutukoy ng hangganan ng mga lupaing saklaw ng bawat lungsod, bayan, at lalawigan sa Pilipinas.
Isa pang problema: Inuna ng mga nakaraang administrasyon ang distribusyon ng mga lupaing madaling ipamahagi tulad ng mga government-owned land, at lupaing napagkasunduan na ng may-ari at magsasaka. Ang naiwan sa atin ay mga lupaing maraming kumplikasyon, at ugat pa ng mahabang debate at demandahan.
Dagdag din nga pong suliranin ang masalimuot na sitwasyon sa ARMM. Ang lupa ng ARMM ay tinatayang 1.5 milyong ektarya. Pero ang lupang nakatala na dinatnan natin, ngayon ay nasa 2.9 million hectares na dahil sa patung-patong na pag-angkin ng lupa. Nagtataka nga po si Governor Mujiv Hataman ng ARMM at tinanong niya sa akin minsan, “Boss, paano kaya nanganganak ang lupa?”
Wala po tayong balak na ipasa ang mga suliraning ito sa susunod sa atin, para pag-ugatan lang ng panibagong mga problema at ng lalong pagkaudlot ng repormang agraryo.
Sa 2015, makalipas ng 102 taon, matatapos na rin ang Cadastral Survey. [Palakpakan] Ngayong taon, ihahain din nating muli sa Kongreso ang panukalang batas para i-extend ang paghahain ng Notice of Coverage, na hindi agad natapos nang husto dahil nga sa mga problemang kinailangan muna nating solusyonan. [Palakpakan] Oras na maihain ang panukalang batas, umaasa tayong maipapasa ito sa lalong madaling panahon.
Kung tiwala nga po ang pag-uusapan, dapat ding isama ang Bangsamoro. Matapos ang mahabang panahon ng hidwaan at napupurnadang negosasyon, naibalik na natin ang tiwala. Pruweba ponito: Noong nakaraang Marso, nilagdaan na ang Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro. [Palakpakan]
Pero simula pa lang ito ng ating pag-usad sa landas ng malawakang pag-unlad sa Mindanao. Wala pong nakakatangging napag-iwanan ang ARMM. Gusto po nating bigyan ng pantay na pagkakataon ang lahat ng Pilipino, kaya nga dapat may boost up, para naman maka-catch up ang ating mga kababayang nasa laylayan. Halimbawa, sa budget na iminumungkahi natin para sa 2015, 5.17 billion pesos mula sa budget ng DPWH ay nakalaan para sa imprastraktura ng ARMM. [Palakpakan]
Kasalukuyan na po nating pinapanday ang panukalang Bangsamoro Basic Law. Humihingi po tayo ng pang-unawa sa ating Kongreso ukol rito. Mahalaga pong maging masusi ang paghimay natin ng bawat probisyong ilalatag. Sa abot ng ating makakaya, isusulong natin ang isang panukalang batas na makatwiran, makatarungan, at katanggap-tanggap sa lahat. [Palakpakan]
Kung maisasabatas nga po ang Bangsamoro Basic Law bago matapos ang taon at maisasagawa ang kinakailangang plebesito, mabibigyan ng isa’t kalahating taon ang Bangsamoro Transition Authority para ipakita ang positibong pagbabago. Kung maaantala naman ito, natural pong iikli rin ang panahon para mapatunayan na tama nga ang landas ng kapayapaang tinatahak natin.
Napakarami na nga po nating nararating dahil sa tiwala—at wala tayong balak basagin ang tiwalang ito. Ang gobyerno ninyo ngayon: mayroong isang salita. Hindi ko na po iisa-isahin ang mga natupad nating panata sa tuwid na daan; baka masabihan lang tayong nagbubuhat ng sariling bangko. Pero mahirap din namang hindi tayo magbanggit, dahil malamang nag-aabang na ang mga magsasabing wala tayong ginawa. Kaya samahan niyo na lang akong magbigay ng ilang halimbawa: Trabaho’t pagkakataon para sa napakaraming Pilipino, nalikha at patuloy pang nililikha. Sa katunayan, mula Abril 2013 hanggang Abril 2014: nasa 1.65 million ang nadagdag sa bilang ng mga Pilipinong nagtatrabaho. [Palakpakan] Minanang kakulangan sa aklat, upuan, at silid-aralan, napuno na; habang ang mga panibagong pangangailangan dahil sa K to 12, pinupunuan na rin. 1:1 police-to-pistol ratio, meron na rin po. Modernisasyon ng Sandatahang Lakas, nangyayari na. Pangmatagalang kapayapaan sa Mindanao, sumusulong na. Pag-angat ng ating ekonomiya, tuloy-tuloy pa rin. [Palakpakan]
Sabay-sabay nating natutupad ang ating mga pangarap: kalusugang pangkalahatan, silid-aralan, trabaho, daungan, kalsada, paliparan, kaligtasan, kapayapaan. Ang nabawi nating pambansang dangal, sinamahan pa ng pagkilala ng mundo sa bagong anyo ng Pilipinas. Ang kaban ng bayang mula sa pawis ng mamamayan, ginugugol para lamang sa kanilang kapakanan.
Pakinggan po nating muli ang isa pa sa ating mga Boss:

“Ako po si Gina Lastrado, 47 years old. Galing po ako sa Isla 1 Barangay 180, Maricaban, Pasay City.
Ang trabaho ko po doon sa may pinanggalingan namin sa Pasay, ako po ‘yong businesswoman. Ngayon po, pinagpatuloy ko pa rin, ma’am, ‘yong pagtitinda ko. Kailangan po dito tiyaga. Ni-relocate po kami dahil sa aming lugar po ay nasasabing “danger zone.” Karamihan po kasi nasa tabi ng ilog.
‘Yung Ondoy, grabe po talaga. Sabi ko nga hindi mo aakalain na masasabi mong mabubuhay pa kami.
“Kung ikukumpara ‘yung buhay namin doon sa Pasay saka dito, umulan man, bumagyo kumbaga nakakatulog ka nang mahimbing. Wala kang pangamba na ayan na ang baha, hindi ka nakakatulog, ‘di tulad doon sa pinanggalingan namin. Kaya nga sabi ko doon sa mga kasama ko, sa mga natira pa doon, lumipat na kayo kasi wala na kayong pangamba, wala na tayong baha.”
“Pagdating namin dito binigyan po kami ng grocery, saka binigay sa amin ‘yung susi. Hinatid po kami dito sa bahay namin, at iyon pong eighteen thousand, ‘yun ang panimula ng buhay namin dito. Binigyan niya kami ng dignidad ang lahat ng mga taga-squatter area doon sa lugar namin. Napakaganda ng buhay namin dito rin, ma’am. Masasabi mong amin na talaga ‘tong lugar na’to.”  [Palakpakan]
– Gina Lastrado, relocated member of an informal-settler family (ISF) [panoorin ang video]

Ngayon nga po: Ang problemang dinatnan, nasolusyonan. Ang nandiyan, tinutugunan. At ang problemang parating pa lang, pinaghahandaan na rin. Naniniwala ako: Kung mananatili ang inyong tiwala, masosolusyonan natin ang mga ito.
Tingnan po natin ang sitwasyon sa enerhiya. Ginagawa na po natin ang lahat para siguruhing natutugunan ang lumalagong pangangailangan ng bansa. Sa kabila nito, meron pong mga pangyayaring talagang hindi natin inaasahan, na maaaring magbunsod ng problema sa susunod na taon. Halimbawa po: Kailangan nating bunuin ang mga kakulangan dahil sa outages para sa maintenance ng mga lumang planta, ng mga biglaang paghinto ng operasyon dahil sa pagkasira, at ng delay sa implementation o sa pagsasatayo ng mga bagong planta.
Huwag po nating kalimutan, may banta din ng El Niño na makakaapekto sa kapasidad ng mga hydro powerplants, at magpapataas pa ng demand sa kuryente. Kung sa ating mga kabahayan nga, lalakas ang gamit natin ng electric fan o aircon dahil sa init ng panahon, lalo naman po sa mga industriya at negosyo. Hindi ito kasingsimple ng pagpunta sa tindahan at pagsabing, “Pabili nga po ng 600 megawatt generator, at paki-install na rin bukas.”
Ang habol natin: kumpletong paghahanda para hindi tayo maparalisa sakaling mangyari ang worst-case scenario. Dapat, kahit sa susunod na taon pa uusbong ang problema, meron na tayong pinaplanong solusyon para dito. Kaya nga po inatasan ko si Secretary Icot Petilla ng DOE: Makipag-ugnayan ka na sa Joint Congressional Power Commission, sa Energy Regulatory Commission, sa industriya, at ang pinakaimportante, sa mga consumer, upang madagdagan ang kakayahan nating tugunan ang problema sa enerhiya.
Batid ko rin po na apektado ang mga Boss natin sa pabugso-bugsong pagtaas ng presyo ng bigas. Mukhang totoo nga po ang mga ulat: May ilang mga halang ang bitukang hoarder na itinatago lang ang bigas, para kapag tumaas ang presyo, ibebenta nila ang stock para kumita nang di-makatwiran.
Hindi puwede ito. Kung sa tingin nila wais sila, mas mahusay ang ginagawang diskarte ng inyong gobyerno. Ang agarang solusyon: mag-import pa ng bigas, i-supply sa merkado, pababain ang presyo, at panatilihin ito sa risonableng antas, para malugi ang mga nagsasamantala sa Pilipino. [Palakpakan]
Noong Nobyembre ng nakaraang taon, nagsimula na tayong mag-import ng 500,000 metriko tonelada para magsilbing ayuda sa supply na pinanipis ng nagdaang mga bagyo. Dumating na lahat ito nitong Marso. Nito ding Pebrero, inaprubahan ng NFA Council ang pag-angkat natin ng karagdagang 800,000 metriko tonelada bilang pagpuno sa ating buffer stock requirement, at 360,750 metric tons na nito ang dumating ngayong Hulyo; pagdating ng Setyembre, makakarating na ang kabuuan. Naaprubahan na rin ngayong Hulyo ang agarang importasyon ng 500,000 metriko tonelada ng bigas sa pamamagitan ng open bidding. May standby authority rin ang NFA na mag-angkat ng karagdagan pang 500,000 metriko tonelada, bilang paghahanda sa magiging epekto ng kalamidad sa ani at sa presyo ng bigas.
Kapag dumating ang karagdagan nating inaangkat, mapupuwersa na ngayong magbenta ang mga hoarder ng bigas na nakatago sa kanilang mga kamalig. Sa mga hoarder na ito: Kung gusto ninyong makipagmatigasan, okay lang, subukan ninyo ang estado. Tandaan lang ninyo: Anim na buwan lang ang itatagal bago mabulok ang stock sa mga warehouse ninyo. Siguradong malulugi kayo kapag nalunod na ang merkado sa dagdag na bigas. Kumikilos kayo kontra sa mga Pilipino; kami naman, isinusulong ang interes ng bawat Pilipino. Tingnan natin kung sino ang mananalo. [Palakpakan]
Bukod po sa pag-iimbestiga sa mga diumano’y nagtago ng NFA rice, sinisiyasat na rin natin ang lahat ng mga puwedeng nagkuntsabahan sa mga ahensya. Iniimbestigahan na ang mga empleyadong pinagdududahan upang makasuhan at mapakulong ang mga may-sala sa lalong madaling panahon.
Sabay ng pagtugis sa mga mapang-abuso, patuloy rin ang mga proyekto natin para alagaan ang mga nasa sektor ng agrikultura. Ginagawa nating kaakit-akit na kabuhayan ang pagtatanim ng palay. Alam naman po natin na tumatanda na ang ating mga magsasaka, kaya malaki ang maitutulong sa food security kung mahihikayat natin ang mga kabataan na pasukin ang ganitong hanapbuhay.
Nagkakaloob po tayo ng mga makabagong kagamitan sa pagsasaka para sa episyenteng pagtatanim at pag-aani. Mula 2011 hanggang Mayo ng 2014, naipamahagi na natin ang kabuuang 4,628 production machineries, 11,362 post-production machineries, at 105 rice mills sa iba’t ibang farmer’s associations. Sa tulong po nito, nabawasan ang nasasayang sa ani ng ating mga magsasaka. Bukod rito, pinapaunlad natin ang mga patubig, nagpapagawa tayo ng farm-to-market roads, at nagsusulong ng training programs upang masagad ang kanilang kita.
Pag-usapan naman po natin ang budget. Ang Ehekutibo, nagmumungkahi ng mga proyekto at programa; inaaprubahan naman ito ng Kongreso. Kailangan nga lang po nating itigil ang ilan, para makasiguradong sumusunod tayo sa naging desisyon ng Korte Suprema ukol sa Disbursement Acceleration Program o DAP. Alam ko pong kaisa kayong mga nasa bulwagang ito sa paniniwalang hindi dapat ipagkait ang benepisyo sa ating mamamayan, at dapat nga itong makarating sa kanila sa lalong madaling panahon.
Kaya nga po: Ipinapanukala namin ang pagpasa ng supplemental budget para sa 2014, upang hindi naman maantala ang ating mga programa at proyekto. [Palakpakan] Kasabay po nito, nananawagan din tayo sa pakikiisa ng Kongreso, upang maipasa ang isang Joint Resolution na maglilinaw sa mga depinisyon at kaisipang tila pinagtatalunan pa—at iba pang mga usaping kayo lang sa lehislatura, bilang mga nagsulat ng batas, ang makakapaglinaw. [Palakpakan]
Sa unang araw po ng trabaho matapos ang SONA, ihahain natin sa Kongreso ang panukalang 2.606 trillion pesos na 2015 National Budget. Gaya ng lagi, binuo ito kasama ang mamamayan, gamit ang istratehiyang naglalaan ng pondo kung saan lamang ito tunay na maghahatid ng benepisyo. Umaasa po tayo sa pakikiisa ng ating mga mambabatas na pagtibayin ito, bilang pangunahing instrumento sa paglikha ng pagkakataon para sa sambayanang Pilipino.
Pakinggan naman po natin ngayon ang isang benepisyaryo ng Alternative Learning System program po ng DepEd.

“Ako po si Maria Cecilla Fruelda.”
“Bale nabalitaan ko po sa mga kasamahan kong taga-Zambales din po, na naririto na sa Rosario, na maganda daw po ang hanapbuhay dito sa Puting Kahoy kaya kami po ay napalipat dito.”
“Prayoridad nga po naming mga tribo ang maghanap ng pagkain kaysa pong pagtuunan ng pansin ang pag-aaral. Sobra pong mahalaga sa akin ang pag-aaral lalo na po’t noong nakapasa ako ng ALS [Alternative Learning System] dahil kung saan ito na po ang naging simula na matupad ko iyong aking pangarap na maging isang titser.”
“Sa tingin ko po, gaganda ang buhay ng mga kabataang Aeta sa amin kapag nakapag-aral. Hindi po ako nakapasok sa ALS kung saan ay ‘di ko po malalaman iyong mga karapatan namin bilang katutubo at hindi rin po namin maipapaglaban ang aming tinatawag na lupaing-ninuno na ngayon po sa awa ng Diyos ay nilalakad na po ng NCIP para matituluhan ang lupa at mai-award na sa amin.”
“‘Pag ako po ay nakatapos ng kursong Edukasyon, gusto ko po makapagturo sa aming komunidad at gusto ko rin pong maipamahagi kung ano man iyong mga nalalaman ko at higit na kaalaman na dapat ibigay sa mga katutubong Aeta.”
“Napakalaki po ng naitulong ng ALS dahil bukod po nga sa ngayon po ako po’y estudyante ng Luansing, kung saan po’y mas lalo pang nakilala iyong aming komunidad. Marami pa po ang tumulong lalo na po iyong mga kabataan namin, kung saan parang sinundan nila ang yapak ko, mas higit na pong marami ang nag-aaral ngayon kaysa dati.” [Palakpakan]
– Maria Cecilla Fruelda, Aeta tribal leader, ALS learner, and college student [panoorin ang video]

Mga kababayan, siya po, at ang marami pang benepisyaryong tulad niya, ang natatabunan sa tuwing umiingay ang orkestra ng negatibismo sa balita. Itong maiingay na ito, sadyang isinasara ang isip at namumuhay sa sariling mundo at realidad. Habang nakikita ang pagbabago sa lipunan, nangyayari na nga ang ating inasahan: lalong dumadalas, lalong umiinit, at lalong tumitindi ang pag-atake nila sa atin. Habang lumilinaw ang benepisyo ng reporma, pahirap nang pahirap ang pag-asang magtagumpay ang panlilinlang nila, kaya’t nagtatanim sila ng duda. Desperado na po sila.
Bakit nga po ba sila galit na galit? Tingnan po natin ang kanilang motibasyon. Para sa mga ginawa nang negosyo ang kanilang posisyon: kung maayos natin ang mga sistema, nawawalan sila ng pagkakataong mansamantala. Natural lang na kontrahin nila tayo. Ito namang mga walang ibang layunin kundi ibagsak ang gobyerno: Puwede lang madagdagan ang kanilang hanay kung maraming nagdurusa, at nawalan ng tiwala sa sistema. Ngayong nakukumpuni na ang sistema at natutugunan ang pagdurusa, nababawasan na ang puwede nilang i-recruit, kaya pakaunti nang pakaunti ang kanilang bilang. Natural lang din na kontrahin nila tayo. Ang pinakamaingay na kumokontra sa atin ay ang ayaw ng transpormasyon, dahil nagsamantala at nakinabang sila sa lumang kalakaran.
Ganito ko nga po naiisip ang ating sitwasyon: Para tayong mga mamamayang matagal na naipit sa isang isla kung saan may nag-iisang tindahan. Dahil walang pagpipilian, nagpapataas sila ng presyo kung kailan nila gusto, at talaga nga naman pong inaabuso tayo. Inatasan po ninyo akong itimon ang bangka ng estado tungo sa kabilang isla, kung saan mas maraming tindahan, mas maraming pagpipilian, mas maayos ang buhay, at mas malawak ang pagkakataon. Siyempre po, ang nagpapatakbo ng tindahan sa ating islang nilisan, ayaw tayong pumalaot, dahil mawawalan sila ng inaabuso. Lahat, gagawin nila para pigilan ang ating pagtawid sa kabilang pampang. Sasabihin nilang: Pareho lang naman doon; wala naman talagang pagbabago doon. Itatali nila tayo sa daungan, bubutasan ang ating bangka, makikipagkuntsabahan para iligaw ang ating biyahe.
Ang totoo po, hindi naman ako ang kinokontra ng mga ito, kundi ang taumbayang nakikinabang sa tuwid na daan. Kontra sila sa magsasaka sa Iloilo, na mahigit limampung taong nangarap ng maayos na irigasyon, at ngayon ay nakikita nang ginagawa ang Jalaur Multi-purpose River Project. [Palakpakan] Kontra sila sa napakaraming estudyanteng hindi na kailangang magsiksikan sa mga classroom. Kontra sila sa nagkatrabaho dahil nasanay ng TESDA; kontra sa mga maagang naililikas sa panahon ng bagyo dahil sa pinahusay na PAGASA; kontra sa mga informal settler na nailayo sa panganib dahil sa programang pabahay; kontra sa mga maralitang libre nang nakakapagpagamot sa pampublikong ospital; kontra sa mga sundalong may modernong kagamitan kaya mas may kumpiyansa nang ipagtanggol ang bansa; kontra sa mga Moro at katutubong abot-tanaw na ang kapayapaan. Mga Boss, kontra po sila sa inyo. [Palakpakan]
Ang totoo po niyan, wala pa tayo sa puwesto, inaatake na tayo. Sanay na tayong sinasalubong ng negatibong komentarista sa almusal, pang-aalipusta sa tanghalian, insulto sa hapunan, at may intriga pa bilang midnight snack. [Tawanan] Ngayon nga pong Pangulo ako, tuloy pa rin ang mga kontra sa pagbabago. Sa tingin ko, maski sa pagbaba ko sa puwesto, hindi pa rin sila titigil.
Naalala ko po ang isang matandang babaeng nakausap ko dati sa kampanya. Ang sabi niya sa akin, “Noy, mag-iingat ka. Marami kang makakabangga.” Totoo ang kanyang babala. Pero buo ang loob kong kaharapin ang mga nakakabanggang ito, dahil alam ko: iilan lamang sila, at di-hamak na napakarami natin. [Palakpakan] Mas malakas po tayong mga handang makisagwan tungo sa pagbabago. Magtatagumpay tayo sa labang ito, dahil tayo ang nasa tama.Nangarap tayo, nagsimula tayo, nagsikap tayo, nakabuwelo tayo, at ngayon, umaarangkada na nga po ang Pilipino. [Palakpakan] Lalong magiging sulit ang pagod at sakripisyo natin kung itong nasimulan natin ay itutuloy po ninyo.
Kayo ang haharap sa sangandaan; kayo ang magpapasya kung magtutuloy ang pagbabago. Tandaan lang po natin, ito ang aking ikalimang SONA; isa na lamang ang natitira. Sa 2016, pipili kayo ng bagong pinuno ng ating bayan. Ang sa akin lang po: Para ipagpatuloy at mas mapabilis pa ang pagbabagong tinatamasa na ng ating lipunan, iisa lang ang batayan sa pagpili ng papalit sa akin: Sino ang wala ni katiting na dudang magpapatuloy sa transpormasyong ating isinakatuparan? [Palakpakan]
Kayo po ang Boss, kayo ang lakas, kayo ang gumagawa ng pagbabago—kaya kayo rin ang magpapatuloy nito. Nasasainyo kung paanong isusulat sa kasaysayan ang mga panahong ito. Maaari itong maalala bilang tuktok ng ating tagumpay, bilang magandang simulaing nasayang lang. Pero mas maganda pong di-hamak kung maalala ang mga nagawa natin bilang simula pa lang ng ating mahabang paglalakbay tungo sa katuparan ng mas matatayog pang pangarap.
Noong minungkahi po ng ilang mga grupo na ako’y tumakbo, ang sabi nila sa akin, hindi namin inaasahan na lutasin mo lahat ng problema ng ating bansa sa loob ng anim na taon. Pero simulan mo na sana. Nakita naman ninyo kung saan tayo nanggaling, at nakita naman ninyong lampas-lampas pa sa ating mga pinangarap noong simula ang tinatamasa natin ngayon.
Pinapanday na natin ang sistema kung saan talagang patas ang laban; kung saan ang sumusunod sa patakaran ay nakakarating sa nais niyang paroonan; kung saan may tunay na kumpetisyong nagbubukal ng pagkakataon at malawakang kaunlaran; kung saan ang lahat ay may kakahayang panghawakan ang sariling kapalaran. [Palakpakan]
Abot-kamay na ang isang lipunang kayang sumalo, umaruga sa mga nasa laylayan; kung saan ang bawat isa ay kumikilala sa kanyang tungkulin sa kapwa at sa bayan; kung saan tuloy-tuloy at walang hanggan ang pakikiambag at sama-samang pag-angat ng sambayanan.
Papalapit na po talaga tayo sa minimithi nating kinabukasan, kung saan naghahari ang katarungan, at tunay pong walang maiiwan.
Ito ang resulta ng reporma, at ito ang ipinaglalaban natin, at patuloy pang ipinaglalaban: Hindi ang pagpapanatili ng nakasanayan, kundi ang pagbabago ng sistema para makinabang ang lahat. [Palakpakan]
Mga Boss: Binigyan ninyo ako ng pagkakataong pamunuan ang transpormasyon. Kung hinindian ko ang hamon na iniharap niyo sa akin, para ko na ring sinabi na tutulong akong pahabain ang inyong pagdurusa, at hindi maaatim ng konsensya ko iyon. Kung tinalikuran ko ang pagkakataon, parang tinalikuran ko na rin ang aking ama’t ina, at ang lahat ng inialay nila para sa atin; hindi po po mangyayari iyon. Sa paghakbang sa tuwid na daan, pinili ninyo ang mabuti at ang tama; tumotoo kayo sa akin—at ako naman po ay tumototoo sa inyo. [Palakpakan]
Ang transpormasyong tinatamasa natin ngayon, ay magagawa nating permanente sa gabay ng Panginoon. Hangga’t buo ang ating pananalig at tiwala, at hangga’t nagsisilbi tayong lakas ng isa’t isa, patuloy nating mapapatunayan na, “the Filipino is worth dying for” [Palakpakan], “the Filipino is worth living for,” at idadagdag ko naman po: “The Filipino is definitely worth fighting for.” [Palakpakan]
Alam po ni Vice President na noong 1987 magkasama kami. May kudeta, na-ambush po tayo doon, at tapos noon eh pangalawang buhay ko na po ito. Hindi natin maiiwasan mag-isip sa mga binubunggo natin, may araw kayang ‘pag sasampa ka sa entablado, may trabaho ring araw–may magtatagumpay bang maglagay ng bomba? Magtatagumpay ba ‘yung mga maiitim na balak ng atin pong mga katunggaling gusto tayong ibalik sa maling kalakaran? At kung dumating nga ang panahong pong iyon, at natapos na po ang ating pangalawang buhay, masasabi ko ho bang, okay na rin? At sasabihin ko po sa inyo, mata sa mata, sa lahat po ng inabot natin, ako po’y masasabing kontento na ako. [Palakpakan]
Kontento na po ako dahil panatag ang kalooban ko, na kung ako po’y mawala na dito, marami po ang magpapatuloy ng ating tinahak na. Baka iyon lang po talaga ang papel ko–umpisahan ito.
Nandiyan po ang mga taong tulad ni Cardinal Chito Tagle, at Ka Eduardo Manalo, at tulad ni Brother Eddie Villanueva, Father Catalino Arevalo, at Father Jett Villarin, at ni Bishop Jonel Milan, at si Sister Agnes Guillen, and Mae Salvatierra. Sila po sa sektor relihiyoso, tuloy, itutuloy nila ang ating pong sinimulan. [Palakpakan]
Meron pong Aris Alip ng CARD na magtutuloy sa kanyang ambag sa pamamagitan ng microfinance. Nandiyan po ang isang Alice Murphy at ang kanyang mga kasamahan sa urban poor associates na talagang tutuluyan ang pangangalaga sa atin pong informal settlers. [Palakpakan]
Nandiyan po ang ating mga sundalo at kapulisan–talagang araw-araw naman pong pinipililt gawin ang tama, tulad ng ating bagong Chief of Staff, ating mga Service Commanders, mga sundalo ng Light Reaction Battalion, at ng JSOG.
Nandiyan rin po, siyempre, hanay niyong pinanggalingan kong mga pulitiko. May duda ba na dadalhin tayo ni Senate President Franklin Drilon at Speaker Belmonte sa tamang landas? [Palakpakan]
Naging pribilehiyo ko rin ho makipagtrabaho at makipag-ugnayan sa isang governor, Alfredo Marañon ng Negros Occidental [palakpakan]. Hindi ko kapartido, pero palagay ko naman po kasama na niya ako sa fans club sa tama niyang pamamalakad sa Negros.
Mayroon rin tayong mga umaangat na bagong o mas bata sa aking pulitiko. Ayoko naman ho sabihin na napakaluma ko nang pulitiko sa pagtukoy sa mga mas bata.
Mga taong tulad ni Mayor Jed Mabilog at ni Mayor Len Alonte [palakpakan].
Meron naman sa sektor, sabihin na nating mga culture tulad nina Noel Cabangon at ni Ogie Alcasid na hindi pansarili lang ang iniintindi. [Palakpakan]
Gabi-gabi po, bago ako matulog, thank you at nakalampas pa ako ng isang araw. Kung, sabi nga noong bata kami, “finish or not finish, pass your paper” eh dumating na sa akin, palagay ko naman, naramdaman na ninyo kung anong pagbabagong karapatan ng bawat Pilipinong mangyari. At bahala na kayong ituloy ito. [Palakpakan]
Mga Boss, kayo ang gumawa ng transpormasyong ating tinatamasa. Kayo ang susi ng pagpapatuloy ng lahat ng positibong pagbabagong naabot natin. Buong-buo ang tiwala ko, nasa eksena man ako o wala, tutungo ang Pilipino sa tama niyang kalalagyan.
Kaya, hanggang dito na lang po ako. Magandang hapon po sa lahat. Maraming salamat sa inyo. [Palakpakan]

State of the Nation Address
of
His Excellency Benigno S. Aquino III
President of the Philippines
To the Congress of the Philippines
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City, on July 27, 2015]
Maraming salamat po. Maupo ho tayo lahat.
Bago po ako magsimula, hihingi ako ng paumanhin, dahil hindi natin nagawa ang tradisyonal na processional walk. Hindi na rin po natin nakamayan ang lahat ng nag-abang. Medyo masama po kasi ang ating pakiramdam sa kasalukuyan.
Bise Presidente Jejomar Binay; mga dating Pangulong Fidel Valdez Ramos at Joseph Ejercito Estrada; Senate President Franklin Drilon at mga miyembro ng Senado; Speaker Feliciano Belmonte Jr. at mga miyembro ng Kamara de Representante; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno at ang ating mga mahistrado ng Korte Suprema; mga kagalang-galang na kagawad ng kalipunang diplomatiko; mga miyembro ng Gabinete; mga opisyal ng lokal na pamahalaan; mga kasapi ng militar, pulis, at iba pang kawani mula sa ating unipormadong hanay; mga kapwa ko nagseserbisyo sa taumbayan; at sa aking mga Boss, ang mga minamahal kong kababayan, magandang hapon sa inyong lahat. [Palakpakan]
Ito ang aking ikaanim na SONA. Muli akong humaharap sa Kongreso at sa sambayanan upang iulat ang lagay ng atin pong bansa. Mahigit limang taon na ang lumilipas mula nang itinigil natin ang wang-wang, hindi lang sa kalsada, kundi sa buong lipunan; mula nang pormal tayong nanumpang labanan ang katiwalian upang masugpo ang kahirapan; at mula nang natuto muling mangarap ang Pilipino, ang atin pong mga boss. Mga Boss, ito ang kuwento ng ating paglalakbay sa Daang Matuwid.
Nito lang pong Biyernes, pinasinayaan natin ang Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway. Una po ito sa nakapilang Public-Private Partnerships na tayo ang nag-apruba, at sa ilalim ng administrasyon natin binuksan sa publiko. Sa atin pong mga sinundan: Halos magmakaawa ang pamahalaan sa pribadong sektor na lumahok sa mga proyekto. Ngayon sila na ang sumusuyo—dito nga po sa MCX, binayaran pa tayo ng premium na P925 million para sa pribilehiyong itayo ang imprastrukturang kailangan natin. Sa taas din ng kumpiyansa nilang kikita ang proyekto, sabi ng private proponent, libre na ang unang buwan ng toll sa MCX.
Talaga nga pong napakalayo na ng ating narating. Para isakonteksto ito, magbalik-tanaw tayo.
Dinatnan natin ang taumbayang namanhid na sa walang humpay na alegasyon ng kasinungalingan, pandaraya, at pagnanakaw.
Ipinagmalaki sa ating sapat na raw ang mga classroom. Iyon pala, umaabot sa apat na shift ang mga klase. May pumapasok nang madilim pa, at may umuuwing madilim na—pero lahat sila, naiwan sa dilim dahil hindi sapat ang oras ng pag-aaral.
“Uninterrupted growth” ang ibinida ng ating sinundan sa kaniyang huling SONA. Pero nang suriin po, malaking bahagi pala nito ay galing sa remittances ng mga taong nawalan ng pag-asa sa Pilipinas. Ika nga po, “People were voting with their feet.” Kung gagayahin ko ang ganitong estilo, kikilabutan akong angkinin ang tagumpay na nagmula sa pagpapalayas ng ating mga kababayan.
Nang papalapit ang eleksiyon ng 2004, lampas P700 milyon ang diumano’y pinambili ng fertilizer na di-angkop sa pananim, sobrang taas ng presyo, at sa maraming pagkakataon ay hindi man lang nasilayan ng mga magsasaka. Sino kaya ang napataba ng patabang ito? Klarong hindi pananim o magsasaka. Naalala rin po siguro ninyo ang NBN-ZTE scandal. Inimbestigahan namin ito sa Senado; may nagsabing siya raw ay tinangkang suhulan. Nang usisain, ayaw namang magsalita dahil may executive privilege daw siya. Hindi rin naman maipatawag ang dating pangulo—kaya ang natirang matatanong ay ang alipores niyang akusado ng panunuhol. Natural, itinanggi niya ang paratang.
Noong mga panahong iyon, maski bata, natutuhan na ang salitang “scam.” Naaalala siguro ninyo: Ang Hello Garci, na sinagot lang ng “I am sorry.” Ang mga tunay na bank account ng bogus na si Jose Pidal. Ang tinangkang Constitutional Assembly para habambuhay na manatili sa puwesto. Ang EO 464 na nagtangkang supilin ang katotohanan. Ang pagdeklara ng State of Emergency, para umilag sa checks and balances ng 1987 Constitution ukol sa Martial Law. Ang midnight appointments. Ang Calibrated Preemptive Response na ginamit laban sa mga nagpoprotesta. Sa wika pa lang po, mali na ito. Paano nauuna ang response? Para mo na ring sinabing nag-reply ka sa taong hindi ka naman tinext [text].
Ito po ang mga headline na araw-araw nating inalmusal bago tayo manungkulan. Pag-upo naman natin sa puwesto, sunod-sunod nating nadiskubre ang kalokohan ng ating pinalitan. Nabanggit ko na po sa mga nakaraang SONA: Sa NFA, pinalobo ang utang mula P12.3 billion noong 2001, patungong P176.8 billion noong Hunyo 2010. Sinabayan ito ng sobra-sobrang pag-angkat ng bigas na nabulok lang sa kamalig. Sa PAGCOR, isang bilyong piso para sa kape. Sa MWSS: Patong-patong na pa-bonus. Sa Laguna Lake: higit sa P18 bilyon ang tinangkang lustayin sa paglalaro ng putik. Di ko nga po lubos maisip kung paanong naatim ng mga pasimuno nito ang makinabang sa pagdurusa ng ating mga kababayan.
Bawat opisyal ng gobyerno, nanunumpang maging makatarungan sa kapwa at sumunod sa batas. Pero klaro: Ang ginawa ng nauna sa atin, kabaliktaran nito. Nakita natin ang pinakamasahol na ehemplo noong Nobyembre ng 2009, nang pinaslang ang 58 na Pilipino sa Maguindanao. Isipin lang ito, mali na. Ginawa nila, lalong mali pa. Pero ang matindi po: Naniwala silang malulusutan ito, dahil nasa poder sila—kaya nila itinuloy. Ilang halimbawa pa lang po ito na batid n’yo; napakarami pang iba.
Sa ganitong sitwasyon, masisisi ba natin ang mga kababayang lumikas na dahil walang makitang pag-asa?
Gaya ninyo, sumagi rin sa isip kong sumuko na lang. Nang pumanaw ang aking ina, lalo pang nabawasan ang ating kumpiyansa; nawala ang aming pinuno at inspirasyon sa pagtutulak ng pagbabago. Sa burol niya, may lumapit sa akin at nagmungkahing tumakbo raw po ako sa pagka-pangulo. Ang sagot ko: Hindi naman ako masokista. Kasama ako sa nagpapahinto ng mga ginawang mali; batid ko ang lubha ng sitwasyon. Tiyak ko ring may mga detalye pang inilihim sa atin, at sadya ngang mas malaki pa sa ating nalalaman ang problema. Nang ako nga po ay tawagin ninyo para maglingkod, ang naging tanong ko: Kung hindi agad malutas ang mga problema, gaano kahaba ang magiging pasensiya ng aking mga Boss, bago nila ibaling ang galit sa akin?
Isa sa mga nakakumbinsi sa akin si Alex Lacson. Ang sabi niya: “Simulan lang ang pagtigil sa pang-aabuso, sapat na. To stop the hemorrhaging would be enough.”
Pakinggan po natin siya:

In 2008, our Philippines was ranked by World Bank as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
At that time many of my friends and I were looking for a good man, not only a good politician to be our president in 2010.
Noong namatay si Cory at nagsalita si Senator Noynoy sa kaniyang burol, doon namin napagtuunan ng pansin si Senator Noynoy, in the same manner that Conrad de Quiros and Billy Esposo saw a great potential in Senator Noynoy.
Then my friends encouraged me to lead the public call to urge Senator Noynoy to run for president. My friends and I went to the house of Senator Noynoy in Times Street. We brought a yellow drum, and we encouraged the public to write letters.
Within 24 hours, there was an outpouring of public support for Senator Noynoy to run for public office.
I did not expect him to be Superman to solve all our problems in the country pero inaasahan ko na simulan niya ang tamang landas.
Mr. President, thank you for heeding the call of the people in 2010, and thank you, too, for respecting my beliefs, even as we disagreed on a number of issues.
Dalhin mo po ang ating bansa sa tamang landas.

[Palakpakan]
Noon pa man, alam na nating katiwalian ang ugat ng pagdurusa. Kaya nga, ang sigaw po natin: Kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap.
Matinding pagsisikap, tapang, political will, at tiwala sa Diyos at kapwa ang kinailangan upang isabuhay ang kaisipang ito. Siyempre po, ang mga dalubhasa ng lumang kalakaran, hindi maamong tupang papayag na lang matigil ang pagkakataon nilang magsamantala. Ginamit at patuloy nilang ginagamit ang impluwensiya at salapi upang labanan ang agenda ng pagbabago. Ginamit din nila ang poder para maghanda ng mga salbabida sa panahon ng paghuhusga.
Ang Ombudsman na itinalaga para bantayan ang katiwalian, diumano’y nagbulag-bulagan sa mga eskandalo ng nakaraang administrasyon. Na-impeach siya sa Kamara, at nagbitiw sa puwesto bago malitis ng Senado. Ang Punong Mahistradong tila ba may pagkiling sa nag-appoint sa kaniya, ay napatunayang naglihim ng yaman at ari-arian sa SALN, na-impeach ng Kongreso at na-convict ng Senado.
Kapalit nila, nagtalaga tayo ng mga taong may integridad at sariling pasya. Ang bagong Ombudsman: si Conchita Carpio-Morales. Ang bagong Chief Justice: si Ma. Lourdes Sereno. Ngayon, may sapat na panahon na siyang magpatupad ng reporma sa Hudikatura. [Palakpakan]
Pati po sa ibang ahensiya, nagtalaga tayo ng tapat at matatapang na pinuno. Sa COA, agad nating inilagay si Chairperson Grace Pulido-Tan. Sa Ehekutibo naman, nag-appoint din tayo ng mga palaban: si Commissioner Kim Henares sa BIR, at si Secretary Leila de Lima [palakpakan] naman sa Department of Justice. Wala silang inatrasan sa pagtupad ng kanilang tungkulin. Sa inyong lahat, isang taos-pusong pasasalamat.
Sa itaas, gitna, o ibaba ng burukrasya, napakarami nang sinuspinde, tinanggal sa puwesto, sinampahan ng kaso, o di kaya’y nasa piitan. Kung may nagdududa pang tunay ngang nakapiring ang katarungan, maganda po sigurong ituon nila ang pansin sa tatlong senador na kasalukuyang naka-detain, at sa dating pangulong naka-hospital arrest.
May mga magsasabi: Mag-move on na raw tayo. Ako naman po ay naniniwala sa sinabi ni George Santayana: Ang makalimot sa mali ng nakaraan, garantisadong uulitin ito.
Tingnan po ninyo ang ginagawa ng mga nagkasala sa atin. Una, ipinapalimot ang kanilang mga nagawa. Pagkatapos, sasabihin nila, “Kawawa naman kami.” Sinamantala na nga tayo, sinasamantala pa ang likas nating pagkamaawain, para tuluyang makatakas sa pananagutan. Ang kasunod, gagawa sila ng paraan para makabalik sa poder. Di ba’t iyan naman talaga ang kanilang master plan, upang patuloy pa tayong pagsamantalahan?
Natutuhan ko nga po sa aking mga magulang, sa simbahan, at sa mga proseso ng batas: Anumang paghihilom ay nagsisimula sa pag-amin at pagsisisi ng nagkasala. May naalala ba kayong nagsabing, “Sorry sa pagnanakaw at pang-aabuso, handa na akong magbago”? Ang sa akin lang po: Makaka-move on lang tayo kapag nakamtan ang katarungan. [Palakpakan]
Nagpatuloy nga po ang pagsasaayos ng mga institusyon, upang muli silang maituon sa tunay nilang mandato. Halimbawa: Sa Government-Owned and -Controlled Corporations. Ang mga itinalaga dito, nanumpang pangalagaan ang yaman ng bayan. Ang masakit, maski nalulugi na nga ang mga GOCC, kaliwa’t kanang benepisyo’t insentibo pa ang ipinamudmod nila sa kanilang sarili. Kumbaga sa baka, habang ginagatasan ang institusyon, gusto pang karnehin. Kaya ang dibidendo ng nakaraang administrasyon, P84.18 billion lang sa loob ng siyam at kalahating taon.
Sa atin, nabawasan na ang GOCCs sa pagpapasara ng mga nawalan na ng saysay, pero dahil pinatino ang palakad: Umabot na sa P131.86 billion ang dibidendo [palakpakan] sa loob ng limang taon mula nang tayo’y maupo. Hindi nga po malabong bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto ay madodoble na natin ang dibidendo ng ating pinalitan, na mas mahaba ang panahon para mag-ipon. [Palakpakan]
Ganitong paninindigan din ang ipinamalas natin sa BIR, na siyang pinakamalaking revenue generating agency ng pamahalaan. Dumating tayong pinakamataas na sa kasaysayan ang P778.6 billion na koleksiyon noong 2008. Tinambakan natin ito. Noong 2012, P1.06 trillion ang nakolekta ng BIR—ang unang pagkakataon sa kasaysayang tumawid ng P1 trilyon ang ating koleksiyon. [Palakpakan]
Nitong nakaraang taon, umakyat na ito sa P1.3 trillion, at aabot pa sa P1.5 trillion ang malilikom ngayong 2015. [Palakpakan]
Limang taon lang ang kinailangan para mapantayan, mahigitan, at halos madoble ang pinakamalaking nakolekta ng ating sinundan. Nagawa ito nang tumutupad sa pangakong di magpapataw ng bagong buwis, maliban sa Sin Tax Reform. [Palakpakan]
Paano narating ito? Simple lang po: Ako po’y naniniwalang mabait si Commissioner Kim Henares, pero ‘yung kaniyang mga kinasuhan ay iba yata ang opinyon. Si Commissioner Kim Henares, walang tax evader na sinanto. Ngayon, 380 kaso na ang naisampa laban sa mga nagtangkang umiwas sa buwis. Ginawa rin niyang episyente ang sistema ng pagbabayad ng buwis, at sinigurong malinaw sa lahat ang kanilang tungkuling makiambag sa pag-angat ng bansa.
Sa Pambansang Budget: Sa ilalim ng pinalitan natin, laging reenacted ang bahagi o kabuuan nito. Noong 2007, halimbawa, halos Abril na naaprubahan ang GAA. Masama na po, na ang mga proyektong natapos na ay pinondohang muli. Ang mas malala: Pati ang Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses, kabilang na ang pasahod, ay kasama sa reenacted budget na ito. Ibig sabihin, ang nakasahod na ng unang tatlong buwan ng 2007, pinaglaanan pa ulit ng pondo. Saan kaya napadpad ang mga sobrang ipinagkaloob at hiniling?
Ang napatunayan natin: Kung makatwiran ang mungkahi ng Ehekutibo sa budget, maayos ang magiging diyalogo sa mga miyembro ng Kongreso. Agarang maipapasa ang GAA, mas mapapabilis ang pagdating ng serbisyo sa ating mga kababayan, at mas maagang maiibsan ang kanilang paghihirap.
Naging malinaw ang mensahe: Seryoso tayo sa pagbabago; patas ang laban dito. Ang resulta: kumpiyansa sa ating ekonomiya.
Nang nagsisimula pa lang tayo, hindi ko inasahang manunumbalik agad ang tiwala ng mundo sa Pilipinas. Ang inisip ko lang po noon: Itigil ang kalokohang umiiral sa sistema, para mahinto ang paglubog ng sitwasyon ng ating kababayang naghihikahos sa kahirapan. Sumagi man lang ba sa isip ninyo na magtutuloy-tuloy ang pag-angat natin sa global competitiveness rankings, at magiging tanyag tayo dahil sa bilis ng paglago ng ating ekonomiya? Ngayon, ang Pilipinas, nabansagan nang “Asia’s Rising Tiger,” “Asia’s Rising Star,” at “Asia’s Bright Spot.” [Palakpakan]
Ngayon nga po, sa kauna-unahang pagkakataon, investment grade na tayo ayon sa mga pinakatanyag na credit rating agencies. Malinaw ang sinasabi nito sa mga negosyante: Sulit mamuhunan sa Pilipinas; nabawasan na ang peligro sa pagnenegosyo dito. Ngayon, mas mababa ang interes at mas mahaba ang panahon ng pagbabayad ng utang, na nakakaengganyo sa mga negosyanteng tumaya sa Pilipinas. Sa pagtatayo at pagpapalawak ng negosyo, sisigla ang kalakalan, lalakas ang kompetisyon, at dadami ang oportunidad. Lahat ito, direktang resulta ng pagsulong ng reporma sa Daang Matuwid. [Palakpakan]
Tingnan po natin: Noong 2010, nasa P1.07 billion lang ang net foreign direct investments na pumasok sa ating bansa. Noong 2014, pumalo na ng $6.2 billion ang net foreign direct investments. [Palakpakan] Ito ang pinakamataas na naitala sa ating buong kasaysayan.
Pati sa domestic investments, napakasigla ng mga numero; ngayon, ang Pilipino, tumataya sa kapwa Pilipino. Ikumpara natin: Mula nang una itong itala noong 2003 hanggang sa pag-upo natin noong 2010, P1.24 trillion lang ang approved na domestic investments. Mula naman third quarter ng 2010 hanggang 2014, ang ipinasok na puhunan ng ating mga kababayan sa merkado: P2.09 trillion na po. [Palakpakan]
Sa manufacturing naman po: Aaminin ko, noong unang nanungkulan tayo, isa sa mga pinakamalaking palaisipan ang pagbabalik ng sigla sa sektor na ito. Humarap sa maraming hamon ang mga industriya: Kuryente pa lang, napakamahal na nga, di pa tiyak. Di rin po biro ang pagtatayo ng pasilidad, dahil malaking puhunan ang kailangan para sa mga makina at pagsasanay ng mga tao. Kaya po ultimo low-tech na electric fan noon, kinailangan na nating angkatin.
Dahil sa repormang nagpanumbalik ng kumpiyansa sa ating bansa, lumago ang manufacturing sector. Ang three percent annual average growth ng sektor mula 2001 hanggang 2009, naiangat natin sa eight percent mula 2010 hanggang 2014. [Palakpakan]
Malinaw po: Kaya nang makipagsabayan ng Pilipino. Dati, ang tanging bentahe natin ay ang mababang pasahod sa ating mga manggagawa. Ngayon, dinadala na rin dito ang mga pabrika ng hi-tech na kagamitan: mula sa mga bahagi ng eroplano, mga electric tricycle, mga printer, at iba pang digital media products, hanggang sa high-quality medical devices gaya ng aortic catheter, at gamit para sa in vitro diagnostics at hemodialysis treatment.
Pakinggan po natin kung gaano kalinaw ang pagbabago:

Napakahalaga ng ginawa ng Administrasyon na ito. Ibinaligtad ‘yung ating corruption trends of the previous administration.
Kasi kapag walang rule of law, ‘yung mga korporasyon na okay lang sa kanilang maglagay, okay lang silang ‘wag magbayad ng tamang buwis, parang sila ‘yung nagkakaroon ng tinatawag nating competitive advantage.
President Aquino has walked the talk. Ginawa niya ‘yung sinasabi niya. Noong inaresto nila ‘yung dating presidente, at inaresto ang tatlong senador, pinalitan natin ang isang Chief Justice. Dati, iniisip ng mga tao, ‘Ay, untouchable ‘yan.’ Pero ngayon, nasa piitan.
The strong message has been sent. At dahil doon, sa rule of law, ‘yung good governance na itinatag ng administrasyong ito, ‘yung ating foreign direct investments from 2 billion, umakyat to 6.2 billion.
Ang laki nung tinalon natin, 33 places, nung mga bansang niraranggo ng World Economic Forum at sinasabi ito ng World Economic Forum na nangyari iyon dahil sa anti-corruption agenda. Dahil sa reform na ginawa ng gobyernong ito. Dapat lamang ang bawat Pilipino, matuto tayo at siguraduhin natin na sa mga susunod na administrasyon, ipagpapatuloy natin ito.

[Palakpakan]
Alam po natin: Ang pangunahing sukatan kung tunay na tumatalab sa karaniwang Pilipino ang pag-unlad ay ang nalilikhang trabaho. Suriin natin ang pagbabago sa aspektong ito.
Taon-taon, mahigit 800,000 ang mga bagong pasok sa ating labor force. Idagdag na rin po natin diyan ang naiulat na pagkaunti ng overseas Filipinos. Noong 2011, nasa 9.51 million ang naitalang overseas Filipinos ng Department of Foreign Affairs. Sa huling datos naman ng Disyembre ng 2014, nasa 9.07 million na lang ito. Hindi kalabisang isiping marami sa tinatayang 440,000 nabawas sa kanila ay bumalik sa Pilipinas, at nakahanap ng trabaho. [Palakpakan]
Bagama’t may bagong salta sa merkado, mga balikbayan, at dati nang walang trabaho, ang unemployment rate, bumaba sa 6.8 percent noong nakaraang taon. [Palakpakan] Ito ang pinakamababa sa loob ng isang dekada. Linawin ko rin po: Permanenteng trabaho ang nalikha natin; hindi tayo nag-hire ng magwawalis ng kalsada tuwing survey period lang, para kargahan ang resulta.
Kaakibat ng paglikha natin ng trabaho ang maaliwalas na ugnayan ng manggagawa at negosyante. Ikumpara po natin. Noong siyam at kalahating taon ng nakaraang administrasyon, ang natuloy na labor strike: 199, o halos 21 kada taon. Sa limang taon po natin, ang suma-total ng natuloy na strike: 15 na nga lamang po. [Palakpakan] Noon nga pong 2013, ang nag-strike sa buong bansa: isa. Ito ang pinakamababa sa kasaysayan ng DOLE. [Palakpakan]
Kaya naman po talagang bilib tayo kay Secretary Linda Baldoz, at sa sektor ng manggagawa at mga nangangasiwa. Si Sec. Linda po, hindi lang magaling; napakadali mo pang katrabaho dahil lagi kang positibo. Ikaw na nga ang tinagurian kong Pastora ng Gabinete. Maraming salamat sa iyo, Linda. [Palakpakan]
Talagang napakalaki na nga po ng pagbabago. Noon, ang mga signage na lagi nating nakikita, di ho ba, “No Vacancy”? Ngayon, nagkalat ang mga anunsiyong “For Immediate Hiring”; magbukas ka lang ng diyaryo, makikita sa classified ads ang maraming kumpanyang naghahanap ng maeempleo. Ang iba nga, pagandahan pa ng insentibo. Merong magpa-interview ka lang, ililibre ka na ng almusal. Kapag na-hire naman, sagot na rin nila ang blow-out para ipagdiwang ang bago mong trabaho.
Nabanggit nga po sa akin ng ilang negosyante na pahirapan na ngayong makahanap ng accountant. Naalala ko po kasi nung bata ako, maraming kumukuha ng BS Commerce Major in Accountancy. Nang bumisita tayo sa Bicol University, naikuwento ko ito sa kanilang presidente. Tanong ko: Di ba meron kayong accountancy program? Meron daw po, pero kahit sila ay nahihirapang punuin ang sariling accounting department. Bakit? Sabi po kasi ng presidente nila, ang mga estudyante nila, 3rd year pa lang, nire-recruit na ng mga accounting at auditing firms. [Palakpakan]
Nagawa po ito dahil sa pagtugon sa tinatawag na job-skills mismatch. Dati, maraming nagsasabing wala silang trabaho, kahit napakarami namang bakanteng posisyong nakatala sa PHIL-JobNet na hindi napupunuan. Ang simpleng dahilan: Hindi tugma ang kakayahan ng ating mga kababayan sa hinahanap ng merkado. Simple lang din po ang solusyon dito: Kausapin ang mga prospective employer, para malaman kung anong klaseng kaalaman ang hinihingi ng mga posisyong binubuksan nila. Dito naman tayo nagsasanay ng trainees, upang masagad nila ang oportunidad.
Ang prinsipyo ng ating pamumuno:  Sa halip na bigyan ang kapwa ng isda, turuan siyang mangisda. Ang pag-unlad at pagkakataon, sinisiguro nating masasagad ng ating mga kababayan. Hindi puwedeng daanin sa trickle down, “bahala na,” o “sana” ang pag-abot nito sa mga pinakamahirap. Ang paninindigan po natin: inclusive growth.
Ang agenda: ayuda, kaalaman, kasanayan, at kalusugan para walang maiiwan. Ang isa sa mga mekanismo: Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program.
Pinalawak natin nang husto ang saklaw nito. Ngayon, nasa mahigit 4.4 million na ang kabahayang nakikinabang sa programa. [Palakpakan] Malayong-malayo ito sa dinatnan nating 786,523 lamang na kabahayan. Nitong taon, 333,673 ang nagtapos sa high school; kabilang sila sa unang batch ng ating mga benepisyaryo sa pinalawak na Pantawid Pamilya. 13,469 sa kanila ang tumanggap ng honors at iba’t ibang gantimpala. [Palakpakan] Iyon nga pong dalawang benepisyaryong nakilala ko, nakapasok sa quota course na Civil Engineering sa University of the Philippines.
Ang lahat po ng benepisyaryong ito, tataas ang antas ng kaalaman; sa halip na menial jobs ang pasukan ay malamang makakuha sila ng mga trabahong maayos ang mga suweldo. Income tax pa lang nila, bawi na ang puhunan ng estado, at maitutuloy natin ang siklo ng pagbibigay-lakas sa mga nangangailangan. Bonus pa po ang lalong magandang kinabukasang nag-aabang para sa mga honor students na pinagtapos ng programa.
Pakinggan po natin ang isang natulungan ng Pantawid Pamilya:

Ngayon, mas nagsikap ako. Kasi po dati, nakikita ko po ‘yung hirap ng pamilya ko. Pero ngayon, dumating po ‘yung 4P’s nakita ko po na may mga tao na tumutulong sa iyo. Alam ko po na hindi sila humihingi ng kapalit pero po sa akin sa pagsisikap ko sa pag-aaral ‘yun na po ‘yung ginagamit ko bilang kapalit. ‘Yung pera po na binibigay ng gobyerno hindi po namin sinayang ‘yun. Kaya po natutustusan po ‘yung mga gastusin ko sa paaralan. 
Noong nakapasa po ako ng UP, masaya po ako kasi ‘yun po talaga ‘yung pangarap kong paaralan. ‘Yun po ‘yung naibigay sa akin ng CCT, nabigyan po nila ako ng mabuting edukasyon upang makapagtapos po ako ng high school at ngayon po makapag-aral po ako ng college.
Alam ko po na maraming bumabatikos sa programang ito, pero gusto ko po na sabihin kay Pangulong Benigno Aquino na tingnan na lang po nila ako, kami. Kami po ‘yung mga patunay na ‘yung perang nilalagak ng gobyerno ay hindi nasasayang. Napupunta ito sa mabuting adhikain na alam ko na balang-araw makakatulong upang mapataas ang estado ng ating bansa.

[Palakpakan]
Sa Pantawid Pamilya, kapalit ng tulong sa mga benepisyaryo, pangunahin nilang dapat tutukan ang pag-aaral ng mga anak. May paunang bunga na po ito: Ayon sa pag-aaral ng Philippine Institute for Development Studies, noong 2008, mayroong 2.9 million na out-of-school children sa ating bansa. Lumaki ang ating populasyon, pero noong 2013, ang natirang out-of-school children, 1.2 million na lang po. [Palakpakan] Idiin po natin ang diperensiya: 1.7 million. Para po nating pinuno ng estudyante ang humigit-kumulang 42,500 na bakanteng classroom. Siyempre, bukod sa Pantawid Pamilya, may kontribusyon din ang Alternative Learning System para masigurong pati ang mga katutubo at street children ay hindi napapag-iwanan.
May mga nagtatanong pa nga rin po: Nasaan ang resulta ng Pantawid Pamilya? Sagot po natin diyan, “Naman.” Ang akala kaya nila, itong Pantawid Pamilya ay parang mahiwagang tabletang kapag ininom ng kinder, pagkatapos ng ilang oras ay college graduate na? [Palakpakan at tawanan] Baka po kulang sila ng pagkakataong mag-aral kaya tululungan natin silang magbilang: 13 taon ang K to 12, samantalang anim na taon lang ang aking termino. Nahahalata tuloy kung sino ang medyo matinding mambobola.
Ang lakas din ng loob ng ibang ipagsigawan: May leakage daw ang Pantawid Pamilya. ‘Yun pala, para makapangutya sila, taong 2009 na datos ang ginamit. Paalala lang po: Kalagitnaan ng 2010 nang ako’y naging Pangulo; mukhang ibang pinuno ang dapat nilang singilin sa tinatawag nilang leakage. [Palakpakan] Malamang, pagdating ng panahong ang mga benepisyaryo’y nag-aambag na sa ekonomiya, ang mga tumutuligsa ngayon, mag-uunahang magsabing sila ang ama o ina ng pinalawak na Pantawid Pamilya.
Sa sektor naman po ng edukasyon: Sinisiguro nating napupunuan ang mga pagkukulang ng nakaraan, natutugunan ang mga pangangailangang dumarating sa kasalukuyan, at napapaghandaan pati ang para sa kinabukasan.
Unang dalawang taon pa lang natin sa puwesto, naisara na ang dinatnang backlog na 61.7 million textbooks at 2.5 million na upuan. Pagdating ng 2013, ang backlog na 66,800 classrooms, at ang kulang na 145,827 na guro, natugunan na rin sa tulong ng ating local government unit partners. [Palakpakan]
Sa estima ng DepEd, mula 2010 hanggang 2017, ang kabuuang bilang ng madaragdag na estudyante: 4.7 million. Bunsod po ito ng pagdami ng enrollees at pagpapatupad natin ng K to 12. Para matugunan ito, kailangan nating magdagdag ng tinatayang 118,000 classrooms. 33,608 dito, naipatayo na. Ngayong taon, nakasalang na ang pagpapagawa ng mahigit 41,000 pa. Ang natitirang 43,000, nakapaloob na sa inaasahan naming ipapasa ninyong 2016 budget. [Palakpakan]
Tinatayang 130,000 naman ang kailangan nating guro. Nitong 2014, ang na-hire na ay 29,444. Ngayong taon, ang kabuuang bilang ng guro na target nating ma-hire: 39,000. Ang natitira pang 60,000, nakapaloob na sa panukalang 2016 budget na sana po’y aprubahan n’yo. [Palakpakan] Ayon nga po kay Bro. Armin, ang suma-total ng naipagawa nating mga classroom at na-hire na guro ay higit pa sa pinagsama-samang nagawa mula sa nakalipas na 20 taon bago tayo manungkulan.
Naipamahagi na natin ang karagdagang 73.9 million textbooks, na susundan pa ng 88.7 million ngayong taon.  Ngayong 2015 din, naihatid na sa mga paaralan ang 1.6 million na upuan, na daragdagan pa uli ng 1.6 million bago matapos ang taon. Sa budget na isusumite natin para sa 2016; nakalagay na ang pondo para sa dagdag pang 103.2 million textbooks, at 4.4 million na upuan. Malinaw po: Hindi na tayo mag-iiwan ng sakit ng ulo sa susunod sa atin. [Palakpakan]
Linawin ko lang po: Nagpatupad tayo ng K to 12 dahil hindi praktikal ang pagsisiksik ng kaalaman sa 10-year basic education cycle. Tandaan lang po ninyo noong tayo’y nag-umpisa, tatatlo na lang tayong bansa na may 10-year basic education sa buong mundo. Kinukuwestiyon na ang credentials ng ating mga kababayan sa ibang bansa; mayroon na ring na-demote, dahil hindi raw sapat na patunay ng kakayahan ang diplomang tangan niya. Kung ang lumang kalakaran sa edukasyon ay maihahalintulad sa manggang kinalburo, ngayon, sinisiguro nating hinog ang kakayahan ng mga estudyante na magpanday ng sariling kinabukasan.
Pakinggan po natin ang isang patunay:

Father ko po, jeepney driver since bata pa po ako. Noong second year po ako, na-stroke po ‘yung nanay ko. Actually po, hindi ko na po tinanong. Alam ko po na incapacitated na po sila para po mapag-college po ako.
Sa halip po na mag-stop po ako, kinontinue [continue] ko po ‘yung pag-aaral ko using the K-12 program. Ang napili ko pong specialization is Drafting Technology po.
Part po ng K-12 program is ‘yung career immersion po. Napunta po ako sa CLP metal, isa pong company ng metal fabrication.
Job description ko po ay mag-design po ng mga makina. Ang machine po na ito is pang-dehair po ng baboy. Once na po sumalang ‘yung baboy diyan, after several seconds po, wala na pong balahibo ‘yung baboy.
May nabibili pong ganyan kaso po abroad pa po. Sa design po ng CLP, kami po ‘yung nag-a-adjust sa budget na binigay ng customer.
Proud na proud ako, kasi hindi po lahat ng 19-year old ngayon ay kayang mag-design ng machine.
Ipinagmamalaki ko na K-12 graduate ako dahil nasusuportahan ko na ‘yung pamilya ko, and I’m learning while earning.

Kung sa tech-voc naman pumasok, nakahanda na rin ang ating pinalakas na mga programa para sa kanila. 7.8 million na ang mga nagtapos sa iba’t ibang kurso ng Technical Vocational Education and Training na pinangasiwaan ng TESDA. Sa Training for Work Scholarship Program lang po, umabot na sa 821,962 ang napagtapos. Ano na kaya ang sitwasyon nila? Ayon sa pag-aaral, 71.9 percent na ang agad nakahanap ng trabaho, kumpara sa 28.5 percent dati. Ang ilang industriya pa nga, talagang pumapalo na dahil 91.26 percent po ang employment rate ng mga nasa semiconductors and electronics industry—konti na lang po, 100 percent na. [Palakpakan]
Naikuwento nga po sa atin ni Sec. Joel Villanueva: May OFW na napilitang umuwi. Akala niya, wala nang pag-asang umasenso. Nag-aral siya ng “hilot wellness massage” sa TESDA; ngayon po, apat na ang branch niya ng spa. Naikuwento ko na nga rin noong nakaraang SONA ang isang PWD na dating barker; ngayon, escalation supervisor na siya sa isang BPO. [Palakpakan]
Sa Sari-sari Store Training and Access to Resources Program o STAR naman, may isang sari-sari store owner na kumikita dati ng P800 kada araw; ngayon, P4,000 na ang kita niya. Kung susumahin nga po, halos pareho na nga kami ng suweldo ng benepisyaryong ito, [palakpakan at tawanan] kahit hindi parehong stress ang dinadaanan namin. [Tawanan]
Paano nagawa ito? Sinanay siya sa bookkeeping, inventory management, accounting, at iba pa. Talagang bilib po tayo, dahil pati kung paano siguruhing mapupunta sa tama ang dagdag na kita, itinuturo din sa STAR program.
Pakinggan po natin ang isa sa mga nakinabang sa programa ng TESDA at ng Coca-Cola:

[Mayroon nang 34,414 sari-sari store owners ang natulungan ng TESDA STAR program.]
Pareho po kaming mag-asawa na walang trabaho. Nag-training po kami sa STAR program. Itinuro po sa amin kung paano ba mag-manage ng negosyo, kung paano mo palalaguin.
Noong nagtayo po ako ng sari-sari store, gawa lang po sa kawayan. Ngayon na-concrete na. Isa po ito na makakatulong sa mga anak ko, mabigyan ko naman sila ng magandang buhay. Marami na akong naibebenta. Dumoble pa po ‘yung income ko.
Nagpapasalamat po ako sa ating Secretary General Joel Villanueva dahil sa kanilang programa, nagkaroon po ako ng pagkakataon na maipakita ‘yung kakayahan ko sa pagnenegosyo.

Dumako naman tayo sa sektor ng kalusugan. Sa maraming Pilipino, sagabal sa pagtupad ng mga pangarap ang pagkakasakit. Ang mga pamilyang umaasenso, back to zero kapag tinamaan ng karamdaman. Nauubos na nga ang ipon, nababaon pa sa utang.
Sa PhilHealth po: Dumating tayong 47 milyong Pilipino lang ang benepisyaryo. Halos dinoble na po natin ito. Nitong Hunyo, pumalo na ang saklaw ng ating PhilHealth sa 89.4 million na Pilipino. [Palakpakan] Ang pagbabago pa nga po: Tuwing eleksiyon, parang kabuteng nagsusulputan ang mga bagong benepisyaryo ng PhilHealth. Imbis kasi na pangangailangan ng taumbayan, interes ng kandidato ang naging basehan. Tinama na natin ang ganyang kalakaran.
Heto pa po. Noong 2012, inanunsiyo natin: Kung kabilang ang pamilya mo sa lowest quintile o ang pinakamahirap na 20 porsiyento ng ating populasyon, at nagpagamot ka sa pampublikong ospital, sigurado, wala kang kailangang bayaran. Simula po noong 2014: Lumawak na iyan para saklawin ang susunod na quintile sa ating lipunan. Ibig sabihin, para sa pinakamahirap na 40 porsiyento, libre na ring magpagamot sa mga pampublikong ospital. Ito po ‘yung pagkalingang tinatawag ng iba na palpak at manhid. Ang tugon ko po, sabi nga ni Aiza Seguerra noong araw, “I thank you, bow.” [Palakpakan]
Ngayon, pakinggan po natin ang ilan sa mga resulta ng pinaigting na PhilHealth program:

Ako po’y na-diagnose na merong quadruple po ‘yung bara sa puso ko.
Di po namin actually alam kung papaano kami makakapagpa-opera nang ganoon. Hinihingan po ako ng P300,000. Sa  PGH, P700,000. Sa UST daw, P800,000 naman po ang hinihingi sa akin.
Sumagot po ‘yung isang doktor. PHILHEALTH naman pala ‘yung misis ninyo. Qualified ‘yan. Ipasok na sa Z-package ‘yan. Ooperahan po kayo.
Halos tumayo lang kami, nag-ayos kami ng papeles, tapos nadugtungan na ‘yung buhay ko, ‘di ba?
‘Yung tinanggap ko pong serbisyo, doon sa ospital, para na rin akong nasa private eh. ‘Di ako kinonsider [consider] na charity patient. Pay patient po kayo. PhilHealth po ang magbabayad niyan.
To be honest, wala po akong binayaran. ‘Yung aming hinahanda-handang kaunting pera ay magagamit namin sa post-operation.
Nagpapasalamat po ako sa PhilHealth at siyempre sa gobyerno natin at mayroon palang ganitong mga proyekto ang PhilHealth na makakatulong talaga sa tao.

‘Yung Sin Tax, noon pa dapat ‘yun pala ‘yung sagot kasi meron siyang sariling pondo niya para doon sa kalahatang pangkalusugan. 
Malaki ang naitulong niya sa province of Pampanga kasi before ang kapitolyo gumagastos siya ng P400 million a year para dun sa tulong. Pero noong nagkaroon ng Sin Tax Law, lahat ng mga mahihirap kinover [cover] nila na magkaroon ng PhilHealth.
Malaki ‘yung kapasalamatan ko kay President Aquino, kasi napakalaking kalunasan lalo na sa pondo ng probinsya almost P400 million ang talagang nagamit sa ibang proyekto at galing sa Sin Tax–nakakapagpagawa ng birthing station, napapagawa ‘yung mga hospital namin, nakakapagpagawa sila ng mga health center. Nagpapasalamat ako talaga sa kaniya doon sa pag-aalaga niya sa mga maysakit na mahihirap.

Muli po nating balangkasin ang kuwento ng nakaraang limang taon. Hinabol natin ang mga corrupt at nilinis ang sistema, na nanganak ng kumpiyansa po sa ating mga merkado. Pumasok ang negosyo, lumawak ang oportunidad, habang binibigyang-lakas nating magkatrabaho ang Pilipino. Sila ang tumatangkilik ng mga negosyo; ito naman pong mga negosyo, nakikitang meron nang level playing field; naaasahan ang pag-asenso nang hindi kailangang mandaya. Nagpapalawak sila ng operasyon, at umeempleo ng mas maraming tao. Siklo po ito: katarungan, tiwala, paglago ng ekonomiya, pagkakataon, pag-asenso. Boss, ito mismo ang diwa ng “Kung walang corrupt, walang mahirap.” [Palakpakan]
At hindi lang natin nakamtan ang pagbabago; ang transpormasyong ating tinatamasa ngayon, lagpas-lagpas pa sa inasahan noong simula.
Ang Cadastral Survey, na sinimulan pa noong 1913, tapos na natin. Inabot ng halos isang siglo ang mga nauna sa atin para matapos ang 46 percent nito. Ang mahigit kalahati pong natitira, nabuno natin sa limang taon sa puwesto. Ito pong Cadastral Survey ang tumutukoy sa hangganan ng mga lupaing saklaw ng bawat lungsod, bayan, at lalawigan sa Pilipinas. Sa ARMM, halimbawa, para bang nanganganak ang lupa: Sabi ng mapa, 1.2 million hectares lang ang meron, pero kung susumahin ang idinedeklarang lupa, 3.7-million hectares ang inaabot. Ngayon, dahil naayos na ang land record system, wala nang nanganganak na lupa sa ARMM.
Noong 2011 po, inimbentaryo natin ang mga sitio; tinukoy natin kung sino pa ang nangangailangan ng kuryente. Gawa ng Sitio Electrification Program, nakapaghatid na tayo ng liwanag sa 25,257 sitiong natukoy sa imbentaryong ito. Dagdag pa rito, dahil sa paggamit ng solar at iba pang teknolohiya, kahit malayo o liblib na lugar, nagkakakuryente na rin. Ngayon po, 78 percent na ng target ng SEP ang energized na. At tinitiyak sa atin ng DOE na bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto, lahat ng naitala noong 2011, may kuryente na. [Palakpakan]
Tunghayan po natin ang isang magsasakang nakinabang sa ating Sitio Electrification Program.

Noon wala pang ilaw dito, kawawa ka. Kailangan magtitiis, ‘yung ginagamit namin ‘yung gas. Nagkailaw kami noong July 2015. Ngayon, sobra ah, sobrang saya namin nung unang mabuksan ‘yung ilaw dito sa bahay eh. Tuwang-tuwa sila na ano, manood-nood na ng bala o makinig ng mga magagandang awitin.
‘Yung mga bata nakakapag-aral siyang mabuti lalo na sa gabi. Kahit gabi nagtatrabaho ako eh, kasi ‘yung mga spotlight ko tsina-charge ko sa kuryente kaya ko mag-overtime. Eh dagdag kita ‘yan sa buhay.
– Domingo Bonifacio
Maraming pagbabago ang buhay ng mga tao rito noong nagsimulang may kuryente. Marami po ang nadagdag na pagkakitaan katulad ng mga weaving. ‘Pag may mga sewing machines, maka-design ba sila ng mas maganda. And food processing kailangan ang mga maraming equipment run by electricity. Mga estudyante nagre-research sa internet. Madami ang naitulong ng electricity sa pag-unlad ng Bauko. Malaki ang tulong na nagawa niya, congratulations to our President for making Bauko a better place to live in.

Sa aviation naman po, sunod-sunod din ang good news: Ang significant safety concerns na ipinataw ng International Civil Aviation Organization noong 2009, natanggal na noong 2013. Sa parehong taon, pinayagan ng European Union ang ating flag carrier na muling lumipad patungong Europa. Noong 2014 naman, isa pang local carrier ang pinayagan ng European Union, habang inangat na tayo ng U.S. Federal Aviation Administration sa Category 1, mula sa nangyaring pag-downgrade sa Category 2 noong 2008.
Dahil dito, dumadami ang flights papasok at palabas ng bansa, at napapadali ang paglipad ng mga turista sa loob ng Pilipinas. Ang maganda pa: Nitong Hunyo, inalis na rin ng EU Air Safety Committee ang travel ban sa lahat ng ating air carrier. Ito po ang unang pagkakataong tinanggal nila ang ban sa buong civil aviation sector ng isang bansa. Ngayon, lahat ng airlines natin, direkta nang makakalipad papuntang United Kingdom, Italy, at iba pang bansang kasapi ng EU.
Sa seafaring: 2006 pa lang po, kinuwestiyon na ng European Maritime Safety Agency o EMSA ang ating pagsunod sa Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers. Dahil dito, nagkaroon ng bantang hindi kilalanin ng EU ang ating maritime education certificates. Kung hindi tayo umaksiyon, may potensiyal na mawalan ng trabaho ang tinatayang 80,000 marinong Pilipinong naglalayag sa mga barkong Europeo.
Agad na kumilos ang MARINA at DOTC para iayon ito sa mga pandaigdigang pamantayan. Hanggang ngayon, kinikilala pa rin ng EU ang ating mga sertipikasyon. Sa susunod na audit ng EMSA na magsisimula ngayong Oktubre, ang garantiya ng MARINA sa atin: Tiyak, papasa na po tayo. [Palakpakan]
Kay Sec. Jun Abaya: Huwag ka sanang panghinaan ng loob kung tila nalilimot ng iba ang nagawa mo para sa ating mga marino, ang pagtanggal ng ICAO sa significant safety concerns sa ating aviation sector, ang pag-alis ng European ban sa ating mga eroplano, at ang pag-akyat natin sa Category 1 ng U.S. Federal Aviation [Administration]. Ipinagbawal mo rin ang pagpapalaot ng barko kapag may bagyo, na nakatulong upang mailayo sa panganib ang pasahero. Bihira na po tayong nakakakita ng balitang parating may barkong lumulubog tuwing may bagyo. Lahat ng ito, naisasantabi dahil sa masalimuot na hamong hinaharap natin sa pampublikong transportasyon. Pinakamalaking halimbawa na nga po ang MRT.
Bihira ang nagbabanggit na may katuwang tayong pribadong korporasyon, na naalala ang kanilang mga karapatan, pero tila ba nalimot ang kanilang mga obligasyon. Ang katuwang na ito, sagot ang maintenance. Dapat, noong 2008, nagkaroon ng general overhaul ang MRT, pero nang suriin ng ating Department of Transportation and Communication, halos pagpipintura lang ang pinagawang overhaul. Sa pagwawalang-bahalang ito, parang ginarantiyang masisira ang tren. Di po ba maski sinong kumpanya, dapat sinisigurong masusulit ang kanilang investment? Pero hinayaan lang nilang lumala nang lumala ang sitwasyon hanggang umabot sa puntong ipinasa na sa atin nang ora-orada ang pagsasaayos ng MRT.
Nang aayusin na natin, bigla naman silang humirit, sila na lang daw ulit. Pero ang mungkahi nilang pagsasaayos, di-hamak na mas mahal kaysa ating plano. Siyempre, katumbas nito, dagdag na gastos at perwisyo sa taumbayan. Hindi tayo pumayag, at kumilos na nga para makakuha nga ng ayuda tulad ng mga bagong bagon. Ang problema, mapilit ang korporasyon, kaya’t pina-TRO nila ang pagbili nito. Kaya umabot sa ganitong sitwasyon ang MRT.
Secretary Jun: Ikaw, ako, at ang buong Kamaynilaan, hindi natutuwa dito. Ang trabaho ng pribado, ipinasa sa atin. Ang solusyon naman natin, hinarang nila. Malinaw nang hindi magtatagpo ang agenda natin at ng MRTC. Ngayon: Humahakbang na tayo para i-buy-out ang korporasyon. ‘Pag naayos ito, ang estado na lang ang tanging magdedesisyon.
Habang sumasailalim sa prosesong ito, nagsasagawa na tayo ng agarang maintenance. Paparating na rin ang mga mas malalaki at pangmatagalang solusyon. Sa susunod na buwan, darating na ang prototype ng bagong bagon; ‘pag pumasa ito sa pagsusuri, mula Enero ay 3 bagon ang sisimulang i-deliver kada buwan hanggang makumpleto ang in-order nating 48. Ongoing na rin ang proseso para sa mga bagong riles, at pag-a-upgrade ng signalling system at automatic fare collection system; inaasahan ang lahat ng ito bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto. Ang power supply para sa mga tren, maa-upgrade bago matapos ang 2016. May 12 escalator na ring maaayos bago matapos ang taong ito, habang ongoing na ang procurement para sa rehabilitasyon ng 34 pang escalator at 32 elevator. Ipapaalala ko lang po: Hindi puwedeng laktawan ang proseso sa mga bagay na ito; ayaw na nating maantala ng kaliwa’t kanang demandahan ang atin pong mga hakbang.
May mga nagsasabi nga pong may blinders daw ako para sa taong matagal na nating kasama sa Daang Matuwid. Ako, mulat sa maganda, pero batid rin natin ang mga hindi maganda. Ako ba ang may blinders, o itong mga pangit lang ang nakikita?
Sa Sandatahang Lakas naman: Noong Nobyembre ng 2010, nagkaroon ng panibagong tensiyon sa pagitan ng North at South Korea; pinangambahang magkakaroon ng giyera doon. Kinailangang magsagawa ng plano para ilikas ang lagpas 46,000 na Pilipinong nasa South Korea, pati na ang walong kababayan nating nasa North Korea.
Nang tanungin natin ang AFP kung anong asset ang magagamit para sa evacuation, ang sagot nila, may nag-iisang C-130 ang atin pong Air Force. Ano ang pinakamabilis na round trip? Sampung oras. Ang lulan: 100 katao. Kinalkula ko po: Lagpas 46,000 ang Pilipinong dapat ilayo sa gulo; ibig sabihin, sa pinakaepisyenteng kondisyon, 460 round trips ito, na higit sa 4,600 oras o tinatayang halos 200 araw na pagbiyahe. Hindi naman maaasahang kakayanin ito ng lumang C-130. Kung barko naman daw ang ide-deploy, 1,000 katao ang kakayaning iuwi sa isang biyahe. Suwerte na kung abutin ng sampung araw ang roundtrip. Kung natuloy ang gulo, baka tapos na ang putukan, di pa tayo nakakapaglikas nang husto. Kumilos tayo agad para matugunan ang mga limitasyon nating ito ng sitwasyon natin noon hanggang sa kasalukuyan.
Ngayon, ang dating nag-iisang C-130 na nagagamit natin, tatlo na, at target nating makakuha ng dalawa pa. May kasama na rin sila; nariyan na ang una sa tatlo nating binili nating C-295 medium lift transports at paparating na po ngayong taon ang dalawang kapatid nito. Asahan na rin natin ang dalawa pang C-212 light lift transports bago matapos ang 2015. [Palakpakan]
Kung patong-patong na pagsubok ang ating kakaharapin, gaya noong nangyari noong 2013, kailangan din natin ng mas marami at mas malalaking assets. Nang tumama si Yolanda, nasira ang mga daungan; naging limitado ang kakayahan nating magdala ng ayuda. Sa ganitong pagkakataon, mahalaga ang tinatawag na landing craft utility na puwedeng dumaong sa dalampasigan. Ngayon, magiging sampu na ang dinatnan nating apat na landing craft utility: Mayroon na tayong BRP Tagbanua. Sa mga susunod na linggo, darating din ang dalawang Landing Craft Heavy mula sa Australia; napakagalante nga po ng pagkakabigay nito, pati spare parts at generator kasama. Target pa nating bilhin ang tatlo; inaayos na natin ang papeles upang sumulong na ang proseso. Dahil sa mga ito, kapag panahon ng sakuna, mababawasan ang pangangailangan nating umasa sa kawanggawa ng ibang bansa. Mas mapapabilis ang paghahatid sa iba’t ibang panig ng Pilipinas ang ayuda, supplies, at iba pang naglalakihang equipment gaya ng bulldozer na kinakailangan para sa clearing at relief operations. [Palakpakan]
Kung pagtatanod sa ating teritoryo naman ang pag-uusapan, ang F5 fighter jet na niretiro noong 2005, mapapalitan na ng 12 na bagong FA-50 fighter. Sa Disyembre lalapag ang unang dalawang unit niyan, at makukumpleto naman ang delivery pagdating ng 2017. Nariyan na rin ang mga barkong pandigma na BRP Gregorio del Pilar at Ramon Alcaraz, pito sa 13 na in-order nating AW-109 helicopters, anim sa walong Bell-412 helicopters, 617 na troop carrier trucks, at 50,629 assault rifles. Target din nating makuha ang dalawa pang frigates, anim na Close Air Support Aircraft, 142 armored personnel carriers, at iba pang makabagong kagamitan gaya ng 49,135 units ng force protection equipment, 2,884 na grenade launchers, at karagdagang 23,622 na assault rifles. [Palakpakan] Sa kabuuan po, may 56 na tayong proyektong natapos para sa modernisasyon, at may 30 pa tayong inaprubahan; ikumpara ninyo ito sa 45 na proyektong natapos ng tatlong administrasyong nauna sa atin.
Pakinggan natin ang isa sa mga kawal ng ating Air Force:

For the record, sir: Ang Air Force po ngayon ay may force na. May joke or stigma po kasi sa Air Force na dati puro “air,” walang “force.” On behalf of the Air Force, we would like to thank you for the legacy that you’ve put in.
Bago lang po ako sa Philippine Air Force pero sa apat na taon ko sa Philippine Military Academy, napag-aralan namin ‘yung kahalagahan ng air power and air defense. At sa apat na taong iyon, nalaman namin na humihina ang Philippine Air Force. Pero luckily the long wait is over.
Noong December 2012, nilagdaan ni President Aquino ‘yung RA 10349. Nabigyan talaga ng sapat na advancement ngayon ang Philippine Air Force, from its aircraft, its instruments.
Nakaka-boost siya ng morale kasi gaya nga ng kuwento ng mga mistah ko na army. Ang sabi pa niya na, “Mistah, nung narinig ko ‘yung paglipad ng chopper, nabuhayan ako ng loob.”
Isa itong pangarap na unti-unti nang natutupad sa amin.

Sa kapulisan naman, sa unang pagkakataon sa ating kasaysayan, ang bawat pulis, may sarili nang baril. Para naman lalong malinang ang  kakayahang mag-“shoot, scoot, and communicate” ng ating kapulisan, naipamahagi na ang unang 302 patrol jeeps, na bahagi ng kabuuang 2,523 na pino-procure na natin. Ipinamahagi na rin ang 179 sa 577 na bagong utility vehicles. Naipagkaloob na rin natin ang 12,399 na handheld radios. Nagpo-procure na rin tayo ng 30,136 na long firearms, 3,328 investigative kits, at dagdag pa ring 16,867 na radyo. Pakinggan po natin kung paano ito nakakatulong sa trabaho ng ating kapulisan:

[Sa kauna-unahang pagkakataon, naging 1:1 ang police pistol ratio ng PNP]
Noong naging pulis po ako, noong 2003, naisyuhan ng .38, ‘yung paltik ho na tinatawag natin, ‘yung “de-bola.” ‘Yung mga ibang mga criminal, high-powered po ‘yung mga ginagamit. Kung ikukumpara po ‘yung .38, di-hamak po na mas malayo sa ginagamit po ng masasamang elemento.
Ang ginawa ko po noon, bumili po ako ng sarili ko pong baril. Napakahirap po sa isang alagad ng batas kapag buhay ang nakasalalay. Napakalaki ho ng pagbabago simula po nang magkaroon ang mga pulis ng kanya-kanyang sariling baril. ‘Yung baril na binigay sa amin ng gobyerno ay talagang maaasahan po namin.
[Nailaan na ang 24,940 na mga bahay at lupa para sa mga kuwalipikadong PNP personnel.]
Lahat po tayo, nangangarap na magkaroon ng sariling bahay at lupa. Sa ating gobyerno ngayon naisakatuparan po iyon. Bilang isang alagad ng batas na nasa mababang ranggo, ramdam po namin ang ginagawa ng ating Pangulo na pagpapahalaga sa hanay ng pambansang pulisya. Kailangan suklian ho natin ng magandang bagay ‘yun. Gagampanan ko po nang maayos at matuwid ang aking tungkulin kahit ito’y maging kapalit ng aking isang buhay.

Kakambal po ng kagamitan ang estratehiya nating “work smarter.” Isinasabuhay ito ng Oplan Lambat-Sibat na sinimulang ipatupad sa Metro Manila. Pinag-aralan natin ang modus ng mga kriminal, at estratehikong dineploy [deploy] ang ating kapulisan. Kaya nga po nahuhuli ang mga “big fish” na nagmamando sa mga gang, nabubuwag ang mga sindikato, at bumaba ang krimen sa bansa.
Sa loob ng ating termino, halos 163,000 na wanted na ang nahuli ng PNP; higit 1,000 na gang naman po ang na-neutralize, at 29,294 na baril na walang lisensiya ang nakumpiska sa buong bansa. Sa NCR po: Mula Enero hanggang Hunyo ng 2014, nasa 37 ang kaso ng murder at homicide kada linggo. Dahil sa Oplan Lambat-Sibat, bumaba na ito sa 23 kaso kada linggo nitong Hunyo. Sa robbery, theft, at carnapping naman para sa parehong panahon: nasa 444 na lang ang lingguhang average sa NCR, mula sa dating 919.
Nitong nakaraang linggo lang, nahuli na si Dexter Balane, na lider ng robbery and holdup group na kasabwat ng Martilyo gang. Nariyan din ang kilabot na mag-asawang Tiamzon, si Kumander Parago, at ilan pang kadre ng CPP-NPA-NDF gaya nina Ruben Saluta at Emmanuel Bacarra; ang napakailap na si Jovito Palparan, pati na ang mga lider ng BIFF na sina Basit Usman, Mohammad Ali Tambako, Abdulgani Esmael Pagao, at ang international terrorist na si Marwan. [Palakpakan]
Kita po ninyo: Kinakalinga ng Estado ang unipormadong hanay, at sinusuklian nila ito. Sabay ng bagong gamit, itinaas natin ang combat pay ng mga sundalo at subsistence allowance ng buong unipormadong hanay. Nakapagpatayo na rin tayo ng higit 57,000 housing units para sa kanila; aabot pa ito sa mahigit 81,000 bago tayo bumaba sa puwesto. [Palakpakan] Sa mga kampo naman, mayroon tayong mga programang pangkabuhayan, at kasama na sa mga nakikinabang dito ang mga kawal na nasugatan o nabaldado sa paggawa ng tungkulin. Upang magkaroon ng partikular na tuon sa kanila, inatasan ko na po ang AFP na makipag-ugnayan sa Gabinete, upang magsagawa ng mga inisyatibang titiyak na magkakaroon ng disenteng pamumuhay ang mga nagsasakripisyo para sa bayan. [Palakpakan]
Dumako naman po tayo sa imprastruktura. Naaalala ko po noong Congressman ako sa segundo distrito ng Tarlac: ‘Pag tag-araw, maladisyerto ang Tarlac River. ‘Pag umuulan naman, rumaragasa ang ilog, at kasama sa napipinsala ang MacArthur Highway. Tinanong natin, sino ba ang in-charge sa flood control sa aming distrito? Lumapit kami sa Pampanga River Delta Project noon; ang sabi po nila, ‘yung Lower Agno Project daw ang may saklaw nito. Pagpunta naman namin doon, pinabalik kaming Pampanga. Kaysa tulungan kami, nagturuan lang sila.
Tapos na ang panahon ng pag-iwas sa responsibilidad. Sa Daang Matuwid, isa-isang naipatayo ang imprastrukturang matagal nang hinintay ng Pilipino. Nabanggit ko na ang ilan dito: Nariyan ang Lullutan Bridge sa Isabela, na dalawang dekadang hinintay ng mga kababayan natin doon, tulad ni Rodito Albano; [palakpakan] ngayon, nabuksan na. Ang Jalaur River Multi-Purpose Project sa Iloilo, naisip ipatayo noong taong isinilang ako; nag-groundbreaking na po tayo para sa stage 2 nito. [Palakpakan] Ang Balog-Balog Multipurpose Project Phase 2 sa Tarlac, 1980s pa po plinano; ngayon, aprubado na ito, at nagsisimula na ang proseso ng bidding.
Ang Basilan Circumferential Road, taong 2000 pa sinimulang ipatayo, pero matagal nabinbin dahil sa kaguluhan sa lalawigan. Hinahadlangan ng masasamang elemento ang pagpapatayo nito, dahil oras na ito’y maipagawa, magiging mas mahirap ang kanilang pagtakas sa batas; mapapabilis rin ang pagdating ng serbisyo, kaya’t hihina ang impluwensiya nila sa mga kababayan natin doon. Ngayon, tatlong tulay na lang ang tinatapos sa kahabaan nito, pero ang malaking bahagi, dinadaanan na. [Palakpakan]
Nabanggit ko na po ang Muntinlupa-Cavite Expressway na binuksan noong Biyernes. Bukas na rin ang unang dalawang bahagi ng Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway o TPLEX. Ang Phase 2 naman ng STAR Toll, tapos na rin. Kapag nabuo pa ang Cavite-Laguna Expressway Project, ang C-6 Phase 1, ang Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, at ang NLEX-SLEX Connector Road, lalong magiging malawakan ang benepisyo ng ating estratehiyang pang-imprastruktura. [Palakpakan]
Para po tugunan ang pagbaha, mayroon din tayong pagsasaayos at maintenance ng flood control projects. Ilan sa mga ito ang Pasig-Marikina River Channel Improvement Project Phase 2, na natapos noong 2013; ang high impact flood control projects para sa NCR at mga karatig-bayan, matatapos na sa Nobyembre, at target naman nating makumpleto ang Blumentritt Interceptor Catchment Area sa susunod na taon. Ang Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike naman, ia-award na rin sa Disyembre.
Tiyak ko pong batid ng lahat: Hindi batayan kung kapartido ang pinuno sa lalawigan, o kung nanalo tayo doon; ang tanging tanong natin: May pangangailangan ba? Hayaan po nating magsalita ang ilan sa atin pong mga natulungan:

Ang nangyari po kasi noong tumakbo siyang senator, natalo siya rito saka noong tumakbo na naman siyang presidente, natalo na naman siya. Pero inspite of that, tinulungan pa rin niya ‘yung probinsiya namin. Nakita natin ‘yung style of governance niya.
Nakikita talaga nila ‘yung problema ng isang lugar hindi basing on the post that they garnered. ‘Yung probinsiya namin na neglected talaga before kasi kakapiranggot po ‘yung mga naibibigay na mga pondo. Naglalakad ‘yung mga tao for about two days. So with the construction of this road ang daming mabubuksang opportunities sa mga taga-Apayao dito. Gumanda lalo ‘yung agriculture natin. Napi-feel na nung mga tao ‘yung talagang may gobyerno pala.
Sa Pangulo natin, sana pupuntahan mo naman ‘yung lugar para makita mo mismo ‘yung ginawa mo sa lugar ko, na ‘yung sabi mo noon na napakalayong lugar malapit na lang ngayon dahil maganda na ‘yung kalsada.
–Governor Elias Bulut

____________________

Noong nagkita kami po ni President doon sa Bacolod City, sabi niya ‘wag ko daw ulitin ‘yung humiga sa daan. Ang nangyari po ‘yun kasi, I was on my way up dito po sa Candoni and then eventually natapos na pala ng DPWH. So noong nakita ko ‘yung situation, sobrang naging happy ako. So parang naging spur of the moment na, sige na nga, parang magpa-picture tayo dito. 
Basically na-cut in half ‘yung travel time because of the new national road. Candone used to be a very isolated area. And dahil sa pangit pa na daan, ‘yung mga investors ayaw pumunta. But because of the good road as you can see, marami na pong dumadaan na mga public transportation. ‘Yung mga kabataan po natin, instead na maglalakad dahil walang dumadaan na mga public transportation papunta sa school nila, puwede na sila sumakay. When you plant sugar cane, dapat dalhin po ‘yan sa central. So because of the good roads, again, it will be easier, more economical, cheaper.
Mr. President, on behalf of the people of Cauayan, Hino-baan, Ilog, Candoni, Kabankalan, and Sipalay, here in the Province of Negros Occidental, salamat po sa inyong commitment. Salamat po sa inyong mga proyekto at programa. Mabuhay po kayo!
– Rep. Mercedes Alvarez

[Palakpakan]
Kay Governor Bulut, ika-20 ako sa puso ninyo noong Senatorial election noong 2007, ikaapat naman ako noong Presidential elections. Sa mga ipinapatayong estruktura, di naman siguro ninyo masasabing malayo kayo sa puso ko at puso ng ating mga kababayan. Kayo na rin ang testigo: Sa pagkakaroon ng proyekto, hindi boto ang basehan, kundi dapat, pangangailangan. [Palakpakan]
Kay Congresswoman Alvarez naman, na ilang beses na nga pong nagpo-posing nang nakahiga sa mga kalsadang nakumpleto natin: Pasensiya na, Chedeng, pero sa susunod na humiga ka sa kalsada, ipapahuli na kita. Obstruction of traffic ang violation mo. [Tawanan at palakpakan]
Malinaw ang ating estratehiya: Sa pagpapagawa ng mga kalsada, tulay at iba pang estruktura, iniibsan natin ang dapat ibsan, at pinapabilis ang paghahatid ng benepisyo. Ang panawagan ko nga po: Makiambag sana tayong lahat, at maging handang magsakripisyo.
Halimbawa: Para matugunan ang madalas na pagbaha sa Maynila, isinulong natin ang pagpapagawa ng catchment area; pero tumutol po dito ang isang malaking unibersidad. May lumang mga gusali daw kasi silang baka maapektuhan ng gagawing proyekto. Isa pa po: Kailangan nang i-retrofit ang Guadalupe Bridge dahil maaari itong bumigay kapag lumindol. Puwede bang isara ang tulay na ito, nang dadaloy pa rin ang trapiko sa EDSA? Kaya nga hindi puwedeng ipagawa na lang ang tulay nang basta-basta. Para magawa ito, kailangan ng alternatibong daan. May mungkahi at tinatayang 70,000 ang kayang dumaan kada araw dito. Kung magawa ito, ito pong tulay na alternatibo at parallel sa Guadalupe, mapapagawa na ang Guadalupe. Kaya lang po, sa rutang pinili, may mga grupong diumano’y tumututol. Sang-ayon silang maayos ang Guadalupe, sang-ayon silang lumuwag ang EDSA, kung nagkaroon ng panibagong tulay, basta raw ang proyekto, huwag sa kanila itatayo nang hindi sila maabala. Kung ganito nga po ang pananaw, talagang maaantala ang pagpapatayo ng kinakailangan nating imprastruktura.
May mga pagkakataon din pong hindi na nga tayo tinulungan, naglagay pa ng balakid ang nasa lokal na antas. Halimbawa po, may tinamaan ng sakuna. Agad-agad tayong pumunta; sinalubong ako ng Congressman at ng Mayor, pero ang kumausap sa akin, [City] Administrator at Vice Mayor. Ang sabi natin, meron nang kagamitan ang DPWH, at handa na kaming itayo ang temporary shelter n’yo; kailangan na lang ng lupang pagtatayuan. Ang sagot nila, mayroon daw 30 ektaryang puwedeng gamitin. Ang masakit, pagbalik ko, walang kahit anong ibinahagi dahil may paggagamitan daw sila.
Isang horror story lang po iyan. Ang atin po: Kami ay nandito para tumulong. Ipipilit namin ang ayuda hangga’t kaya at naaayon sa batas. Kung ayaw nilang makipagtulungan, ang masasabi ko na lang po: Eleksiyon na sa susunod na taon, at ang mga Boss natin ang huhusga kung sino ang nakabawas o nagpalala ng pagdurusa. [Palakpakan]
Tumungo naman po tayo sa Public Private Partnerships. Kapag pinagsama natin ang solicited PPP projects ng nakaraang tatlong administrasyon, ang suma-total: anim na proyekto. Sa atin, may 50 proyekto na: Ang sampu dito, awarded na; ang 13, nasa bidding; habang 27 naman ang nakapila pa. Kayo na po ang magkumpara sa pagkakaiba.
Dati, walang nakikisali sa proyekto, ngayon, nag-uunahan na ang mga pribadong kumpanya, at nagbibigay ng premium. Suma-total, ang primang natanggap natin mula sa mga kumpanyang katuwang sa PPP, umabot na sa P64.1 billion, na napupunta naman sa kaban ng ating bayan. [Palakpakan] Kada matagumpay na proyekto, magbubunsod din ng higit na kumpiyansa, na siyang magpapabilis sa pagpapatayo natin ng iba pang kinakailangang imprastruktura. Ang pagtitiis ng ating mga Boss, maiibsan, kundi man matatapos na.
Para naman sa imprastrukturang paparating pa lang, hihilingin ko rin: Kalma lang po tayo. Ang procurement, mabilis na ang apat na buwan para makumpleto. Suwerte ka na kung ang in-order mong computer, mai-deliver sa loob ng panahong iyan. Paano pa kaya kung pagpapatayo ng tulay ang pinag-uusapan?
Ang sa akin nga po: Di na baleng hindi ako ang mag-groundbreaking o ribbon-cutting. Ang mahalaga: Gawing pulido at naaayon sa batas ang mga proyekto, para oras na maaprubahan ito, dire-diretso ang pagpapatupad; maski sino ang sumuri, papasa ang kalidad ng ating ipinatatayo. Alam po ito ng ating Gabinete: Sa Cabinet o NEDA Board meeting, minsan na akong nagbirong dapat magdala ng kumot ang mga dadalo, dahil tiyak na gagabihin kami. Personal ko kasing sinisiyasat ang detalye, para ‘pag iniharap ito sa ating mga Boss, sasabihin din nilang, “Aprub kami, dahil nakikita naming tapat ang proseso at tiyak ang pakinabang sa proyekto.”
Napakalaki na po talaga ng pagbabago. Noon ang Pilipino, naglaho ang pag-asa. Ngayon naman po: Sa pinakahuling SWS survey, lumabas na walo sa bawat sampung Pilipino ang tiwalang magiging kahanay, kundi man kahanay na, ang Pilipinas sa “developed countries.” [Palakpakan] Mayroon din pong survey ng Gallup, Inc. Alam po n’yo, isa [ito] sa pinakamatanda at iginagalang na polling agency sa mundo. Tinanong nila ang mamamayan sa 145 na bansa, “Would you say that now is a good time or a bad time to find a job?” Lumabas po na ang Pilipinas ang may pinakamataas na job optimism sa buong Asya-Pasipiko, at pangalawa sa buong mundo. [Palakpakan]
Kumpiyansa nga po ang ating mga kababayan sa estabilidad ng kanilang kinabukasan. Ngayon, maski bagong pasok pa lang sa trabaho ay nakakapaghulog na para sa sariling sasakyan o condo unit. Di na nakakagulat na nitong nakaraang taon, tumaas ng 27 percent ang car sales sa Pilipinas. Ang paniniwala ngayon: Kayang-kaya nang bayaran, di lang ang down payment, kundi maging ang monthly amortization. Sa dami ng nakakapagpundar ng bagong sasakyan, dalawa po sa pinakamalaking kompanyang nagbebenta sa Pilipinas ay inaabot ng dalawa’t kalahati hanggang tatlong buwan bago makapag-deliver ng kotse. Sa sarili ko pong karanasan, noong una akong nagkatrabaho, kinalkula ko kung gaano katagal bago ako makaipon para sa sariling kotse. Dalawampung taon lang naman po ang aabutin, segunda mano pa.
Nakausap din po natin ang mga pinuno ng dalawang malaking kumpanya; ang isa, mayroon nang mga pabrika dito habang ang isa pa ay gusto ring pumasok. Pareho po silang nagpahayag ng interes na magtayo ng research and development facilities dito po sa ating bansa. Nakita nila ang potensiyal at talento ng Pilipinong makatulong upang mapanatili ang kanilang magandang posisyon sa merkado. Ang tanong nila: Kaya ba nating mag-supply ng daan-daang empleadong may masteral at doctoral degrees sa engineering? Ang tugon ng mga kaibigan natin sa DOST: Kayang-kaya. Sabi ko pa po, kung may magbubukas na trabaho sa high-tech na industriya, baka makapagpauwi pa tayo ng mga OFW, na papayag naman sigurong tumanggap ng mas mababang sahod kung mapapalapit sila sa kanilang pamilya. Ang sabi ng mga kausap natin: Hindi kailangang babaan, dahil handa silang tapatan ang suweldo nitong mga kababayan nating ito. [Palakpakan]
Sa sektor din po ng pangingisda, nadarama ang pagbabago sa pagtingin sa Pilipino. Nitong Abril, tinanggal na ng European Commission ang ipinataw nilang yellow card sa Pilipinas. Dahil hindi raw ho dati maayos ang dokumentasyon at tracking, di sila makasigurong nahuli ang mga isda sa legal na paraan. Agad tayong kumilos ang Department of Agriculture upang hindi mapasama sa blacklist ng EU, at hindi mapagbawalang magluwas ng produkto sa kanila. Nang magtungo nga po si Secretary Procy Alcala sa Belgium, sabi sa kanya, huwag daw sasama ang kanyang loob, dahil baka tanungin tayo ng ibang bansang may yellow card pa. Tayo raw kasi ang makakapagturo sa kanila kung ano ang mga dapat gawin para maresolba ang problema. [Palakpakan]
Naalala ko rin po, noong una, pakiramdam ko, kinakausap lang tayo ng ibang pinuno dahil obligado silang kausapin tayo. May ilang halos sermonan tayo nang una nating nakahalubilo. Ngayon, kaliwa’t kanan ang imbitasyon para sa State Visit, may kasama pang papuri. Nakikiusap pa ang iba: Kahit raw dumating tayo sa umaga at umalis din ng tanghalian, basta’t pumunta tayo, ikatutuwa na nila iyon. Nagulat po talaga ako nang minsang may pinuno ng isang pinakamaunlad na bansa, at ang tanong po sa atin, “Ano ba ang inyong sekreto?” Siyempre po, dahil hindi tayo mahilig magbuhat ng sariling bangko, sinagot ko na lang po sa kanya: “Ang sikreto po namin ay sinunod lang namin ang mabuti ninyong halimbawa.” Meron din namang nagtatanong sa atin at maging sa ating mga delegasyon: “Ang ganda ng nangyayari sa Pilipinas; anim na taon lang ba talaga ang termino ninyo? Wala na bang puwedeng magawa dito?” Ang lagi nga po nating tugon, “Nagkaroon kami ng pangulo na talagang gumawa ng paraang manatili sa puwesto. Kailangan naming tiyaking di mabubuksan ang pinto para maulit ito.” [Palakpakan]
Siyempre po, kahit kaliwa’t kanan na ang ebidensiya ng pagbabago, mayroon pa ring kontra sa Daang Matuwid. Ang hirit nila: Mabagal daw tayo. Kapag sila raw ang naging Pangulo, sigurado, gaganda ang buhay. Sa mga medyo may edad po, ang isasagot dito, “Ah, ganun?” sabay taas ng kilay. Para naman sa kabataan, iba na raw po ang tugon nila sa ganoong pahayag, iba na daw po ang uso ngayon eh: E di wow. [Palakpakan]
Ang tanong natin: Paano nila gagawin ang mga pangakong iyan? Ang sagot nila: Basta. Nasaan ang detalye at kongkretong mga plano? Basta. Paano ninyo ipatutupad ang inyong mga pangako? Basta. Pakiramdam yata nila nadadaan sa basta-basta ang solusyon sa ating mga problema.
Wala pa rin talagang gamot na naiimbento para sa mga nagbubulag-bulagan at nagbibingi-bingihan. [Palakpakan] Ang payo ko nga po: Maganda siguro, kapag ganitong harapan nang iniinsulto ang talino ng Pilipino, ilipat muna natin ang channel, at baka may mas mapala pa tayo sa panonood ng sitcom.
Ngayon naman po, may ilang mga batas na nais kong ilapit upang sana’y maipasa sa loob ng kasalukuyang Kongreso:
Pangunahin siyempre po dito: Ang Bangsamoro Basic Law. [Palakpakan] Sa mga tutol sa batas na ito: Palagay ko, obligasyon ninyong magmungkahi ng mas magandang solusyon. Kung wala kayong alternatibo, ginagarantiya lang ninyong hindi maaabot ang pagbabago. Ilang buhay pa ang kailangang ibuwis para magising ang lahat sa obligasyong baguhin ang sirang status quo sa Muslim Mindanao?
Pakinggan po natin ang ilan sa mga maaaring makinabang sa batas pong ito:

[Nasa 4.4 milyong kabahayan na ang naitawid sa mas magandang kinabukasan sa tulong ng 4Ps.]
Dati, mahirap lang, walang pagkain. Kinakain namin ‘yung banggala, ‘yung kamote ba. ‘Yun, ‘yun ang kinakain naman kapag umagahan, ‘yun. Kapag hapunan, ‘yun din. Mahirap magtrabaho kapag magsasaka ka, kasi nahihirapan ka tapos kapag ibenta, maliit lang ang nakukuha mo. Naaawa ako sa kanila dahil nahihirapan silang magtrabaho. At iniisip ko na sana makapagtapos ako ng pag-aaral para maiahon ko sila sa hirap.
Grade 6 ako, naibigay dito ‘yung 4Ps. Gumaan ‘yung loob ko kasi may pera na si Tatay para sa pag-aaral ko. Naisip ko, noong walang 4Ps, wala akong mga notebook o sapatos man. Wala ako noon, pero ngayong may 4Ps na, naglakas-loob ako na magpursigeng mag-aral, kasi para matulungan ko ‘yung mga magulang ko.
Nagpapasalamat ako sa mga DSWD at ‘yung mga gobyerno dahil naisip nilang ibigay ito sa mahihirap. Kung hindi dahil sa kanila, hindi mababago ‘yung pamumuhay namin.

Grabe ang kawalang-hustisya noong mga oras na ‘yun. Kasi, oras ‘yun ng Martial Law, parang mga hayop lang ang tingin nila sa amin. Pinagmamasaker, pinagpapapatay nang walang kalaban-laban. Isa na ‘yung pamilya ko sa mga pinagmamasaker ng mga sundalo na ‘yan eh. ‘Yun ang masakit sa amin kaya nandito kami ngayon, sumasali sa MILF para ipaglaban ang karapatan namin. 
Naisip ko na sumali sa grupo ng MILF, ang prinsipyo namin ay ang nasshur awis-shahada. Halimbawa sa gobyerno ng Pilipinas, dahil doon sa panahon ni Erap pulbusin ang mga taga-Mindanao. Siyempre kahit sinong mga Muslim makakaisip na ipaglalaban ang prinsipyo.
Kapag Muslim ka, Bangsamoro ka, terorista ‘yan kaya di binibigyan ng trabaho baka masira ang isang kumpanya. 
Alhamdulilah. Dumating ang Sajahatra. Mas naengganyo po tayo rito kasi ang lecture sa amin, tapos ina-actual. Ang sa akin lang po, ito na po siguro ang daan upang mabigyan na sila ng tahimik na pamumuhay, mabibigyan sila ng livelihood para hindi na sila maghihirap.
Since 1972, hindi ko naramdaman, naranasan na maging isang mapayapa ang Bangsamoro. Eh ngayon, kung saka-sakaling matupad, Insha Allah, mamumuhay kami nang mapayapa.

Inilalapit din po natin sa Kongreso ang Rationalization of Fiscal Incentives. Kung maipapasa ito, maitatama ang papatsa-patsang sistema ng pagbibigay insentibo at magiging mas makatwiran ang pagbubuwis sa mga negosyo. Hinihiling rin namin ang agarang pagtutok sa Unified Uniformed Personnel Pension Reform Bill, para tuluyang maisulong ang isang makatarungang sistemang pampensiyon para sa kanila. Agaran po sanang maipasa ang batas na ito, dahil ngayon pa lang, trilyong piso na ang kakailanganin para pondohan ang pensiyon ng unipormadong hanay. Kailangan ng awtorisasyon ng batas para matugunan ang masalimuot na sitwasyong ito.
Bukas na bukas naman po ay makakarating na sa inyo ang panukalang budget para sa susunod na taon. Hindi pa po tayo nabibigong ipasa ito sa tamang oras; umaasa nga po ako, na mapapanatili ang tamang kalakarang ito ngayong nasa huling yugto na tayo ng ating administrasyon. [Palakpakan]
Naaalala ko rin po: Kumontra akong pagkaitan ang isang tao ng karapatang tumakbo sa puwesto, dahil lang sa kanyang apelyido. Bakit nga naman tayo gagawa ng batas para pigilang maglingkod ang gustong maglingkod?
Pero napapaisip po ako: May mali rin sa pagbibigay ng pagkakataong habambuhay na magpakasasa sa kapangyarihan ang isang tiwaling pamilya o indibidwal. Ganyang kaisipan din ang dahilan kung bakit, noong may nagmungkahing manatili pa ako sa puwesto—kahit raw dagdag na tatlong taon lang—ako mismo ang tumutol dito. Di tayo makakasiguro kung malinis ang intensiyon ng mga susunod, o kung nanaisin lang nilang habambuhay na maghari-harian para sa sariling interes. Panahon na para ipasa ang isang Anti-Dynasty Law. [Palakpakan]
Dahil sa Kongreso, naipasa ang mga batas na kikilalanin bilang haligi ng transpormasyong sinisimulan natin ngayon. Sa Kamara at Senado, lalo na sa mga kasapi ninyong naging kabalikat sa Daang Matuwid nitong mga nagdaang taon: Salamat sa Philippine Competition Law, sa Act Allowing the Full Entry of Foreign Banks, [palakpakan] at sa pag-amyenda sa Cabotage Law. Salamat sa Sin Tax Reform Act. Salamat sa Responsible Parenthood Act. [Palakpakan] Salamat sa lahat ng iba pang makabuluhang batas na inyong ipinasa. Tunay nga pong napakalaki ng naiambag ng isang Kongresong determinadong maging katuwang sa pagsusulong ng pagbabago. [Palakpakan]
Kanina po, minabuti kong pag-usapan kung saan tayo nagmula upang bigyang-konteksto ang mga hamong hinarap, hinaharap, at haharapin pa natin. Lahat po ng batikos, panlalait, at pang-aalipusta, tinanggap ko bilang kakabit ng pagkakataon at karangalang pagsilbihan kayo. Pero ang totoo, hindi ko ito pinasan nang mag-isa. Hinihingi ko po ang oras ninyo para pasalamatan ang mga naging inspirasyon at katuwang; maunawaan po sana ng iba kung hindi ko sila mababanggit.
Unang-una po, siyempre, ang Panginoong Maykapal na sa bawat sandali ay ginabayan ang ating bansa. Sa aking ama at ina, [palakpakan] na sa paglaban sa pang-aabuso at sa pagsasakripisyo ay naging bukal ng inspirasyon, hindi lang sa aming pamilya, kundi maging sa sambayanan;
Sa atin pong Gabinete, na nabanggit ko na ang ilan sa kanila kanina; hayaan po ninyo akong magpatuloy:
Unang-una, kay Executive Secretary Jojo Ochoa, na tinaguriang Little President. [Palakpakan] Sa mga magulang pa natin nag-umpisa ang matibay nating pag-uugnayan. Nagdamayan tayo sa maraming hamon sa buhay. Ang private practice mo, nasakripisyo sa mahabang panahong naglingkod ka, una sa Quezon City man o sa aking administrasyon. Lahat ng nalalaman mo sa batas, ibinahagi mo sa akin. Hindi mo ako iniwan, kahit sa mga panahong may banta sa ating buhay. Pare, mapalad akong nagkakilala tayo, naging magkaibigan, at magkasangga sa paglilingkod sa ating mga Boss; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Rene Almendras, na kabalikat ni ES Ochoa at naturingang bastonero ng Gabinete: Sabi nga ng iba, dati ang kinis pa ng noo mo, ngayon nagmistula nang humps sa barangay dahil sa pakikisalo mo sa mga kailangan nating harapin;
Kay Secretary Albert del Rosario: [palakpakan] nanumpa ng Biyernes; pagdating ng Linggo, nasa Libya na para pamunuan ang evacuation ng mga OFW na nalagay sa peligro noong panahon ng Arab Spring. Di ko kailanman pinoproblema ang pag-motivate sa iyo; at kung may debate man tayo, nangyayari lang dahil inaawat kita sa pagbiyahe sa pinakamapapanganib na lugar sa mundo;
Kina Secretary Cesar Purisima at Arsi Balisacan: [palakpakan] Pinalad ang bansa sa tandem ninyo. Mula sa big picture, hanggang sa pinakamaliit na detalye, kayo ang nagsisigurong nadadama ng bawat Pilipino ang pag-unlad ng ating ekonomiya. [Palakpakan] Siyempre, ang ilan sa malalaking patunay nito, nagawa sa tulong ni Usec. Cosette Canilao at ng lahat ng bumubuo sa ating PPP center; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Greg Domingo, ang ating pambansang salesman na umakit sa mga negosyanteng mamuhunan sa bansa, [palakpakan] at kay PEZA Director General Lilia de Lima. Inutusan ko na po ang DOST sa pagko-clone kay Lilia de Lima.
Kay Secretary Babes Singson, ang prayer leader ng Cabinet, [palakpakan] tagapagtatag ng mga kongkretong patunay ng transpormasyon, at nagbalik ng tiwala ng taumbayan sa DPWH;
Kay Secretary Mon Jimenez, [palakpakan] isa sa pinakapinagkakatiwalaan nating boses sa Gabinete. Talagang “It’s more fun in the Philippines,” at dahil nga sa pagsisikap mo, umabot sa 4.8 million ang turistang dumalaw sa bansa at direktang lumikha ng trabaho; nagpapasalamat din ako sa kanyang maybahay na si Abby, na tinulungan tayong ilagay sa imahen at salita ang agenda ng positibong pagbabago;
Kay dating Energy Secretary Icot Petilla, na kahit wala na sa aking opisyal na pamilya ay nakikiambag pa rin; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Volts Gazmin, [palakpakan] na nagtitimon sa ating Sandatahang Lakas at sinisigurong lagi tayong handa sa sakuna: Kailanman ay hindi mo kami binigyan ng dahilang mangamba;
Kay Secretary Cesar Garcia, ang ating National Security Adviser, na kahit kakaopera pa lang sa tuhod ay napakabilis sumagot sa aking mga text;
Kay Secretary Janette Garin, [palakpakan] na sumalubong sa MERS, Ebola, food poisoning, encephalitis, at sa sunod-sunod na mga banta sa ating kalusugan. Janette, ang katatagan mo ang nagpapatatag sa ating lahat;
Kay Secretary Dinky Soliman, [palakpakan] na on-call 25 hours a day, 8 days a week, idamay ko na rin lahat ng iyong naging executive assistants, na pagka-graduate sa DSWD ay puwede nang isabak sa anumang krisis sa buong mundo. Dinky, tuwing tatawagin kita ay laging hawak mo na ang tala ng problemang dapat tugunan, ang mga ginagawang hakbang, at ang mga natitira pang dapat gawin. Isang usapan lang, malinaw nang inaasikaso mo ang lahat ng dapat asikasuhin; [palakpakan]
Sa mga nagtitiyak na may sapat na kaalaman at kakayahan ang susunod na henerasyon, sina Secretaries Armin Luistro, Tatti Licuanan, at Joel Villanueva; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Mario Montejo, na tumulong magbalik ng pag-asa sa PAGASA, at talagang nagsikap upang iparamdam ang papel ng agham sa pagpapaunlad ng bansa; [palakpakan]
Kina Secretaries Procy Alcala at Kiko Pangilinan, na nagbubunga na ang repormang ipinunla sa sektor ng agrikultura; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Gil de los Reyes, na hindi natitinag sa pagsulong ng makatarungang repormang agraryo, gaano man kasalimuot ang hamong hinaharap; [palakpakan]
Kina Secretaries Ramon Paje, Neric Acosta, at Lucille Sering na ipinakitang nakatali ang malawakang kaunlaran sa pangangalaga ng ating likas na yaman; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Mar Roxas: Nasa loob o labas ka man ng gobyerno, [palakpakan] hindi tumigil sa panlalait sa iyo ang mga kalaban ng Daang Matuwid. Dahil nga may bilang ka, dahil talagang may ibubuga ka, nagpupursigi silang ibagsak ka. Palibhasa hindi nila kayang iangat ang sarili, kaya pilit ka nilang ibinababa. [Palakpakan] Sa patuloy nilang paninira, ang mga kritiko mo na rin ang nagpapatunay na takot sila sa angkin mong integridad, husay, at kahandaan sa trabaho. Mar, pinatutunayan mo: You can’t put a good man down. [Palakpakan] Tulad ng pagtitiwala ng nanay at tatay ko, magtiwala kang alam ng taumbayan kung sino ang tunay na inuuna ang bayan, bago ang sarili; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Butch Abad, [palakpakan] na kahit pa ba pinaulanan ng di-makatarungang paratang ay patuloy sa pagsigurong ang pera ng bayan ay mapupunta sa taumbayan lamang;
Kina Secretaries Edwin Lacierda at Sonny Coloma, dating Secretary Ricky Carandang, at kina Usec. Abi Valte at Manolo Quezon: [palakpakan] dama ko ang bigat ng pinasan ninyo sa pagsagot sa lahat ng uri ng tanong—may saysay man o wala—para maiparating sa ating mga kababayan ang angkop at tamang impormasyon;
Kina Solicitor General Florin Hilbay at Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Ben Caguioa, [palakpakan] na ipinakita ang karangalan at katapatang angkop sa pagiging mga pangunahing abugado ng Ehekutibo;
Kay Secretary Ging Deles, kasama na si Chair Iye Coronel-Ferrer, na walang kapagurang isinusulong ang isang mapayapang Pilipinas; [palakpakan]
Kay Secretary Julia Abad, na sinisigurong matututukan ko ang lahat ng aking responsibilidad; [palakpakan] sa iyo ako bumabaling para sa agarang aksiyon kaya madalas, ikaw din ang sumasalo ng una kong reaksiyon. Sa kabila nito, lagi ka pa ring cheerful;
Sa iba pang Kalihim na sumasagot ng telepono kahit madaling-araw tawagan: Yasmin Busran-Lao, Francis Tolentino, Lu Antonino, Joel Rocamora, Mely Nicolas, Ronald Llamas, Cesar Villanueva, at Manny Mamba; [palakpakan]
Sa mga hindi kasapi ng Gabinete, pero nakipanday sa Daang Matuwid: Si Governor Say Tetangco, na napakahusay ng pangangasiwa sa Bangko Sentral; [palakpakan]  si Governor Mujiv Hataman ng ARMM; [palakpakan] si Chito Cruz ng National Housing Authority; [palakpakan] si Gerry Esquivel ng MWSS; [palakpakan] at isama ko na rin po si Chairman Bong Naguiat ng PAGCOR na hindi bumili ng kape; [palakpakan]
Sa mga dating naglingkod sa Gabinete na talagang nagpakitang-gilas, lalo na sa yumaong si Sec. Jesse Robredo, [palakpakan] na hanggang ngayon po ay nagsisilbing inspirasyon para sa aming lahat;
Kay Senate President Frank Drilon at Speaker Sonny Belmonte: [palakpakan] na talagang nagbigay ng makabuluhang payo sa harap ng mga pinakakomplikadong hamon; kay Cong. Boyet Gonzales at Mel Sarmiento, [palakpakan] at sa iba pang naging katuwang natin sa pagtahak ng Daang Matuwid;
Sa lahat ng pinuno at kasapi ng unipormadong hanay, na buong tapang at kagitingang ipinagtatanggol ang ating mga Boss at nakikiambag sa seguridad, hindi lang sa Pilipinas, kundi maging sa ibang panig ng daigdig; [palakpakan] sa lahat ng nagtatrabaho sa iba’t ibang sangay ng gobyerno at tunay na naglilingkod sa kapwa Pilipino;
Sa mga negosyante, business federation, at iba pang kabalikat natin sa sektor ng industriya, na nakikiisa sa pagpapaganda ng ating ekonomiya;
Sa mga miyembro ng media na naging patas sa kanilang pagsipat; [palakpakan]
Sa lahat ng sinamahan tayo sa pagtahak ng Daang Matuwid; partikular ko na pong babanggitin si Deedee Sytangco na nagpahayag ng pagsuporta, lalo na sa panahong mabigat ang problema, [palakpakan] sina Alice Murphy at Yoly Ong, na naging bukal ng makabuluhang payo at inspirasyon nitong mga nakaraang taon; [palakpakan]
Sa grupo po nina Jun Reyes at Gigi Vistan na kasama na natin mula pa noong tumakbo ako para sa Kamara hanggang sa Senado. Jun at Gigi, buong pasensiya ninyo akong ginabayan sa tamang bihis, tindig, at pagsalita: Alam ninyong hindi ako tulad ni Kris na sanay sa kamera, at kahit biniro ko kayo na mukhang imposible ang trabaho, naging propesyonal at maaasahan kayo;
Sa aking mga tagapayong espirituwal na sina Father Catalino Arevalo, Sister Agnes, at Father Jett Villarin, [palakpakan] pati na kina Cardinal Chito Tagle, Cardinal Orlando Quevedo, Ka Eduardo Manalo, Bishop Soc Villegas, Bishop Jonel Milan, Brother Eddie Villanueva, at sa ating religious sector,  at sa lahat ng nagpapatuloy, nagdarasal para sa atin, maraming salamat po;
Sa mga tulad ni Joe America, isang blogger na di ko man kakilala ay isinulat: “If the President were in my foxhole, I’d watch his back. That’s because I trust that he is watching mine.” [Palakpakan] Salamat sa iyo at sa iba pang dayuhang nagpamalas ng pakikiisa sa ating agenda ng pagbabago;
Sa mga kabataang tulad ni Francesca Santiago, na sa murang edad pa lamang ay nagpapakita ng pagmamahal sa bayan;
Kay Noel Cabangon at iba pang kasapi ng sektor ng sining at kultura na ipinahiram ang kanilang talento upang ipahayag ang pagbabago; [palakpakan]
Sa aking Ate Ballsy, mga kapatid na sina Pinky, Viel, Kris, at sa aking mga bayaw at pamangkin; [palakpakan] panahon pa nina Mom at Dad, karamay ko na kayo. Nalalapit na ang araw kung kailan hindi ko na kayo kakailanganing idamay sa dagdag pang sakripisyo;
Special mention din po: Kina General Chito Dizon na dating pinuno ng Presidential Security Group, at sa kasalukuyang timon nito na si Commodore Raul Ubando, na dadalawang linggo pa lang sa puwesto ay nag-baptism of fire na sa krisis sa Zamboanga; [palakpakan] si Lt. Col. Francis Coronel na head ng aking close-in security, at sina SPO4 Lito Africano at PO3 Bong Fuyonan, na napakatagal na pong kasama at pinangangalagaan ang seguridad natin; [palakpakan] sa buong PSG, na ipinakita ang propesyonalismo sa pagprotekta hindi lang sa akin, kundi pati kina Pangulong Obama at Pope Francis: Huwag kayong mag-alala, may 21 world leaders pang darating para sa APEC. Karamay ko kayo sa hirap at ginhawa. Malamang, mamaya, bago kayo matulog, baka magkatanungan kayo kung bakit napakaraming hirap at kung nasaan ang ginhawa; parating na po tayo diyan.
Kay Asec. Susan Reyes, ang ating Social Secretary, [palakpakan] na nagpapatunay na di kailangang maging magarbo para itaas ang dignidad ng ating tanggapan; kay Paul Cabral, na laging sinisigurong maayos ang aking kasuotan, [palakpakan] tuloy akala nila mayroon akong fashion sense; at kay Cherry Reyes, na nag-aayos ng aking buhok [tawanan], at nagmimistulang economics practitioner dahil pinupunuan niya ang unlimited wants with very limited resources; [tawanan]
Sa mga kasapi ng aking Private Office sa Malacañang, lalong-lalo na kina Usec. Rochelle Ahorro at Asec. Jun Delantar, [palakpakan] na karamay ko sa stress sa maraming pagkakataon;
At gusto ko pong ipakilala sa inyo, sa mga hindi nakaaalala sa inyo, si Yolly Yebes, na namamahala sa aking tahanan. [Palakpakan] Sinisiguro mong nakakakain ako sa tamang oras, inaayos ang aking gamit tuwing may biyahe sa Pilipinas man o sa ibang bansa, at kung minsan pa nga ay pinagkakatiwalaan pa kitang humawak ng dokumento at nabibilinan para sa aking trabaho. Tunay mong ipinaparamdam ang iyong kalinga hindi lang sa akin, kundi pati sa mga katrabaho ko sa gobyerno. Kapag sinabi ko sa iyong, “may meeting tayo, pakihanda mo naman ang makakain,” hindi mo na ako tinatanong ng “kailan” o “ilan”; hindi mo na ako pinag-aalala, tinitiyak mo na lamang na lahat ng kailangan ay maasikaso. Yolly, minabuti kong personal mong mapanood ang SONAng ito, para masabi ko sa iyo: Maraming salamat sa pakikiambag mo. [Palakpakan]
Sa mga hindi nagdalawang-isip na tumulong sa repacking ng relief goods sa panahon ng sakuna; sa bawat Pilipinong naghandog ng anumang halaga at nagpaikot ng alkansiya para magdala ng pagbabago; sa lahat ng nagparamdam ng suporta, sa text man, liham, o personal; sa bawat batang yumakap sa aking binti at tiningala ako para ngitian; sa bawat estudyanteng nakipag-selfie; sa lahat ng nakisiksik para makipagkamay:
Mga Boss, baka nga po bahagi ng planong wala pa akong katuwang sa buhay o anak, kaya ang naging tutok ko lang ay ang taumbayan. Sa trabahong ito, para akong punching bag na tinapalan ng katakot-takot na duct tape. Pero hindi ako natinag dahil nasa likod ko kayo. Tunay ngang hindi ako nag-iisa. [Palakpakan] Ang kongklusyon ko nga po sa lahat ng ito: Talagang ginagabayan pa rin ako ng aking mga magulang; totoong mahal tayo ng Diyos. Sa inyong lahat: Maraming-maraming salamat. Napakalaking karangalan ang pamunuan po kayong lahat. [Palakpakan]
Ang pasasalamat pong ito, may kasamang panawagan. Ang mga naipunla sa Daang Matuwid, nagdadala na ngayon ng ani, at magdadala ng mas mayabong pang ani sa mga susunod na panahon. Pero mangyayari lang ito kung didiligan at babantayan pa natin ang pananim.
Ilang halimbawa po: Hindi puwedeng putulin na lang ang pagtutok sa modernisasyon ng AFP. Sa Pantawid Pamilya, kapag naitawid na ang bottom 20 percent tungo sa susunod na antas, kailangang siguruhing hindi sila basta-basta babalik sa kahirapan kung tamaan ng sakit o sakuna.
Sa disaster management: Dahil sa malasakit sa isa’t isa, at sa aktibong ugnayan sa mga local government units, naibangon agad natin ang Bohol at Cebu matapos ang lindol. Sa Zamboanga at Tacloban naman, agad nating tinugunan ang pangunahing pangangailangan. Mula sa agarang paghahatid ng pagkain at pagsigurong walang outbreak ng sakit; sa mabilisang pagbabalik ng kuryente, at pagbubukas ng mga kalsada; hanggang sa pabahay at programang pangkabuhayan, ibinuhos at ibinubuhos ng pambansang gobyerno ang lahat ng makakaya. [Palakpakan] Pero may mga natitira pa pong gawain: May mga komunidad pa rin tayong namumuhay sa peligrosong lugar na kakailanganing ilayo sa panganib. Para naman sa rebuilding, kailangang paigtingin ang ugnayan ng lokal at pambansang antas, para mapabilis ang mga tinatapos natin.
Sa ugnayang panlabas: Ginawa at ginagawa rin po natin ang lahat para maging responsableng miyembro ng pandaigdigang komunidad; sa bawat hakbang, ang hinihiling lang natin ay ang makatwiran at naaayon sa batas. Ang problema ng lahat, isinulong nating solusyonan ng lahat, at hindi ng iilang panig lamang. Alam din po ninyo, may hinaharap tayong hamon sa West Philippine Sea. Ang ating kabangga, di-hamak na mas lamang, sa impluwensiya man, ekonomiya, o puwersang militar. Pero sa batayan ng katwiran at pagmamahal sa bayan, hindi po tayo nahuhuli. Kaya gaya sa lahat ng iba pang suliranin, pagkakaisa po ang tanging susi para mapangalagaan ang ating karapatan.
Mga Boss, sa totoo lang, sa mga hinarap nating hamon, puwede namang nagbigay na lang tayo ng band-aid solution. Puwedeng nag-abot na lang tayo ng isang supot ng relief goods, o nakipagsiksikan sa mga photo-op. Pero alam naman nating sa Pilipinas, galit ang tao sa epal. Aanhin nga naman ang pogi points kung magpapamana lang din naman ako ng problema sa susunod na salinlahi? Sa bawat pagkakataon, hinahanap natin ang tunay na sanhi ng mga problema, at naglalatag ng malinaw at pangmatagalang estratehiya upang malutas ito. Ang mga hamon ng bansa, kung hindi man nalutas na, ay nasimulan na ang mga hakbang upang marating ang permanenteng solusyon.
Iyan nga ang napakalaking pagkakaiba. Dati, walang pag-asa. Ngayon, inaasahan, inaabangan, at madalas nga po ay minamadali pa natin ang gobyernong solusyonan ang mga problemang ating hinaharap.
Magbalik-tanaw po tayo: Sa dami ng mga maling kinailangan nating iwasto, hindi lang tayo nanggaling sa zero, sa negative pa tayo nagmula. Negative sa kasangkapang gumawa ng pagbabago. Negative sa pagkakataon. Negative sa pag-asa. Binuno natin ang lahat ng kakulangan; nagdala tayo ng positibong pagbabago, at lampas-lampas pa talaga sa ating inaasahan ang ating narating.
Pakinggan po natin ang ilan pang testimonya nito:
Sa 25 years na pagtrabaho ko dito sa PAGASA, nakita ko po kung paano nag-improve ang aming facilities especially ngayong term ng ating Presidente. 
Dati, bulag ‘yung PAGASA. Sa ngayon, dahil sa mga radar natin at sa mga observation stations na naidagdag, napakalaki ng improvement. Malaki ang pinagbago ng PAGASA. Kasi dati ‘pag taga-PAGASA ka, parang hindi kami acknowledged dahil siguro mababa ‘yung quality ng aming work. Pero ngayon dahil nga sa mga bagong mga equipment, accurate na ‘yung mga aming forecast. Pag taga-PAGASA ka, sikat ka na.

[Palakpakan]

[Parang wala kaming tiwala sa mga pulitiko noon. Marami silang mga pangako, tapos hindi naman ibinigay.]
‘Yung uri ng pamamahala ni Presidente PNoy, walang maliit, lahat ay mahalaga. Dapat hinahatid ‘yung serbisyo kahit hanggang sa pinakamalayong isla kagaya ng Dinagat. Malaki ang pagbabago. Tulad ‘yung mga sitio, ‘yung hindi maabot ng kuryente, binigyan ng mga generator. Tulad ‘yung mga kalsada natin.
[Malaki talaga ang paniniwala namin sa gobyerno natin ngayon. Kung hindi lang siguro si PNoy ang Presidente at hindi si Congresswoman, hindi rin namin alam kung magkaganito ba rin kami ngayon.]
Nagpapasalamat ako sa ganoong uri ng pamamahala na nagiging model ng pamamahala ng maraming leaders. ‘Yung paniniwala na kapag nagsabi tayo na serbisyo ng gobyerno, ‘yung serbisyong nakikita, ‘yung nararamdaman, ‘yung pagbibigay ng inspirasyon sa mga taong umasa, mangarap, na puwede pala akong magsikap, mayroon palang kahihinatnan ‘yung pangarap ko na ito na lahat ay importante, walang maliit.

[Palakpakan]
Mga Boss, kung hindi mapapatid ang transpormasyon, makatwiran nga pong sabihin: Tikim pa lamang itong nakamtan natin; parating pa lang ang tunay na ihahain. Ang sabi nga po natin: You ain’t seen nothing yet. [Palakpakan]
Nabanggit ko po kanina ang SWS survey na hindi masyadong naibalita: 8 out of 10 na mga Pilipino, naniniwalang developed o magiging developed country tayo sa hinaharap. Ito po, pananaw ng ating mga kababayan. Pero ang mga ekonomista po mismo ng NEDA, pinag-aralan ito sa siyentipikong paraan, at pareho ang kanilang kongklusyon.
Tingnan natin: Mula 2010 hanggang 2014, nagtala tayo ng average GDP growth na 6.2 percent; ito ang pinakamasiglang yugto ng ating ekonomiya sa loob ng 40 taon. [Palakpakan] Kung aabot po tayo sa 6.8 percent ngayong 2015, makakamtan natin ang pinakamataas na six-year average growth sa loob ng halos anim na dekada. [Palakpakan] Siyempre po, ang pag-angat ng ekonomiya, may katumbas na pag-angat ng kakayahan ng gobyernong kumalinga at magbigay-lakas sa mamamayan upang masagad ang mga bumubukas na pagkakataon.
Nakikita po ninyo, kung hindi tayo maaantala, kung magtutuloy ang Daang Matuwid, sa loob ng isang henerasyon, first world na raw po tayo. Kung magpapatuloy ang mga repormang bukal ng paglago ng ekonomiya, paglaon, ang tinitingala nating mga bansa, makakapantay na natin, kundi man malalampasan. [Palakpakan] Ito po ba, inambisyon ng kahit sino sa atin noong tayo’y nagsisimula?
Sa kabilang banda naman, kung tayo’y babalik sa baluktot, habambuhay tayong mag-aabang sa wala. Muli tayong mapapag-iwanan, at mababali ang pataas na trajectory ng ating ekonomiya.
Napakaganda na talaga ng ating naipunla, at nagbuhos na tayo ng matinding pagod at sakripisyo upang diligan ito. Sino ba namang nasa tamang isip ang bigla na lamang puputulin ang puno, kung kailan nagsisimula pa lang nating pitasin ang mga unang bunga nito?
May sentimyentong umiiral na sa tingin ko, mahuhuli ng isang tanong. Ang tanong po nila, “Lahat ba ng ating naipundar, lahat ba ng ating pinaghirapan, maglalaho dahil lang sa isang eleksiyon?” [Palakpakan at tawanan] Sa ganitong pananaw, ang susunod na halalan ay referendum po para sa Daang Matuwid. Kayo ang magdedesisyon kung ang pagbabago bang ating tinatamasa ay magiging permanente, o tatanawin lang bilang tsamba at panandaliang pagbangon sa isang mahabang kasaysayan ng pagkadapa.
Ang tanong: Tama ba itong landas na tinatahak natin? Kung sasabihin ninyong hindi, para na rin ninyong sinabing “Mas gusto ko sa dati; bumalik na lang tayo sa baluktot.” ‘Pag iyan po ang inyong itinugon, ako’y mananahimik na lang.
Pero kung ang tugon naman ninyo ay “Oo,” tulad ng lagi, ako naman po’y handang maging inyong dakilang alalay. Maski sa pagbaba sa puwesto, hanggang sa aking huling hininga, makakaasa kayo, gaya ng walang patid ninyong pananatili bilang aking lakas, hindi rin kayo mag-iisa; sasamahan ko kayo, tatabihan ko kayo, magkakapit-bisig nating isasabuhay ang Daang Matuwid. [Palakpakan]
Mga Boss, aaminin ko: Ni minsan po, hindi ko sinabing ako’y perpekto. Minsan, binigo tayo ng ilang inasahan nating alam dapat ang kanilang trabaho. Sa mga panahong tila gumana ang pagpapaduda, baka hindi rin namin nahanap agad at naibahagi ang impormasyon sa oras at sa paraang nais ninyo. Hinihingi ko po muli ang inyong pag-unawa sa mga bagay na ito.
Sa kabila nito, mahaharap ko ang sinoman at masasabing: Ginawa ko ang pinakamainam na desisyon batay sa kaalaman at kakayahang mayroon tayo sa panahong iyon. Kaisa-isang interes ko ang kapakanan ng aking Boss. Ginawa ko ang lahat upang iwanang mas makatarungan, mas maunlad, at tumatamasa ng makabuluhang pagbabago ang ating bansa. [Palakpakan] Hahayaan ko na pong kasaysayan ang humusga. Gaya nga po noong burol ng aking ina, bibigkasin ko ang Ikalawang Aklat ni Timoteo, Kabanata 4, Bersikulo 7: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.” [Palakpakan]
Mga Boss, nanggaling tayo sa sitwasyon kung saan tila nababalot ng kadiliman ang ating bansa; ni hindi natin masigurong may liwanag pang paparating. Binabati na tayo ng bukang-liwayway ng katarungan at pagkakataon.
Nakita naman ninyo ang mga naabot natin. Narinig ninyo ang kuwento ng kapwa natin Pilipinong pinatunayan ang kayang maabot gamit ang sariling lakas, ang pagbabayanihan, ang hindi pag-uunahan, ang pag-aambagan tungo sa katuparan ng kolektibo nating mga adhikain. Ngayon, taas-noo na tayong humaharap sa buong mundo at nasasabing, “Kaya ko. Kaya ng Pilipino. Simula pa lang ito.” [Palakpakan]
Opo, simula pa lang ito. Simula pa lang ng isang bansang hindi mapapayuko, bagkus ay nagiging huwaran ng paninindigan sa buong mundo. Simula pa lang ng ginhawang bunga ng kalayaan mula sa katiwalian. Simula pa lang ng lipunan kung saan ang bawat Pilipino, kung magbabanat ng buto, kung gagawin ang tama, ay tiyak na aasenso. Simula pa lang ito, at hinahamon tayo ng kasaysayang diligan ang transpormasyon, upang magbunga ito ng mas marami pang pagkakataon para sa mga susunod na salinlahi.
Simula pa lang ito. [Palakpakan] Nasa unang yugto pa lang tayo ng dakilang kuwento ng sambayanang Pilipino. Sa gabay ng Panginoong Maykapal, at sa patuloy nating pagtahak sa Daang Matuwid, lalo pang tatayog ang mga pangarap na maaabot natin. Lalo pang lalawak ang kaunlarang tinatamasa natin. Nasasainyo pong mga kamay ang direksiyon natin.
Magandang gabi po sa inyong lahat, maraming salamat sa inyong lahat po.
[Palakpakan]

STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS OF 
RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE 
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES 
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES 
SESSION HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 25, 2016]
 
Thank you. Please allow me a little bit of informality at the outset. You would realize that the three guys in the elevated portion of Congress are from Mindanao. So, wala na talaga kaming masabi. Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III, Members of the Senate, Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the Members of the House of Representatives, Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, President Fidel Valdez Ramos, President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno and the Justices of Supreme Court, His Excellency Papal Nuncio and members of the diplomatic corps. Well of course, I have also to greet the Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, the members of the Cabinet, fellow workers in government, my countrymen.
We cannot move forward if we allow the past to pull us back. Finger-pointing is not the way. That is why I will not waste precious time dwelling on the sins of the past or blaming those who are perceived to be responsible for the mess that we are in and suffering from.
Except maybe to extract a lesson or two from its errors, we will not tarry because it is the present that we are concerned with and the future that we should be prepared for.
Lest I be misunderstood, let me say clearly, that those who betrayed the people’s trust shall not go unpunished and they will have their day in Court. And if the evidence warrants, they will have their day of reckoning too.
When I decided to seek the presidency of this republic, I knew what the ills of our country were; I knew their causes; and I was briefed on those who caused the causes.
I heard the people on the streets complain that justice had become illusory; that equity and fairness and speedy disposition of cases had deteriorated into hollow concepts fit only for masteral dissertations. It was, and still is, very sad indeed.
As a former prosecutor, I know that there are ways of knowing how fast or how slow cases go. What I did was to look into the number of postponements and the time difference between each postponement and the next setting. It was simple as that. I will appreciate deeply if we all in government attend to this urgent need.
I was determined then as I am now determined and better now positioned, to wage war against those who make a mockery of our laws including those who make life for us all miserable.
I wish to assure everyone though that vindictiveness is not in my system. Just like you and I, all equal treatment and equal protection are what I ask for our people.
But we must have the courage to fight for what we believe in, undeterred by the fear of failing or losing. Indeed, courage knows no limits, cowardice does.






At this point, there are concerns few I wish to convey to all to the end that as I perorate on facts, figures, plans, programs, and solutions, these concerns will not dissipate or get lost along our way.
Thus to our religious, bishops, leaders, priests, pastors, preachers, imams let me assure you that while I am a stickler for the principle of separation between Church and State, I believe quite strongly that there should never be a separation between God and State.
During my inauguration last (June) 30, 2016, I said that the fight against criminality and illegal drugs and corruption will be relentless and sustained.
I reiterate that commitment today, and that is why I call on the Philippine National Police, the barangay chairmen, the Mayors, the Governors and all those occupying seats of power and authority, not to lower their guard. There will be no let-up in this campaign. Double your efforts. Triple them, if need be. We will not stop until the last drug lord, the last financier, and the last pusher have surrendered or put behind bars or below the ground, if they so wish.
To our police officers and other officials, do your job and you will have the unwavering support of the Office of the President. I will be with you all the way. Abuse your authority, and there will be a hell to pay, for you will have become worse than criminality itself.
I order the National Police Commission (NAPOLCOM) to hasten the conduct of investigation and adjudication of administrative cases against police officers involved in criminal activities and illegal activities and prescribe policies on lifestyle checks for PNP members. In this quest, I will put at stake my honor, my life, and the presidency itself.
The DILG is also directed to strictly monitor how LGUs perform their supervision functions over the police and those found not performing will be sanctioned including the loss of police deputation from the NAPOLCOM. Let me repeat my warning to all. I repeat my repeat, my repeat to all, do not do drugs because you will be the solution to the drug crisis that has engulfed, “malawak” the nation.
We will create an Inter-Agency Committee on Illegal Drugs that will integrate efforts and strengthen the partnership of all stakeholders.
The reservists will be mobilized for information campaign against drug use and the dissemination of information regarding drug rehabilitation programs being offered by the government. Let us also strengthen our ROTC Program to instill love of country and good citizenship.
We will also prioritize the rehabilitation of drug users. We will increase the number of residential treatment and rehabilitation facilities in all regions of the country. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will facilitate the preparations for the use of military camps and facilities for drug rehabilitation.
There can never be real, tangible and felt development without making our people feel secure. And it is our duty to uplift the people’s welfare.
With this, my administration shall be sensitive to the State’s obligations to promote and protect, and fulfil the rights of our citizens, especially the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable and






social justice shall be pursued, even as the rule of law shall at all times prevail.
My administration shall implement a human approach to development and governance, as we improve our people’s welfare in the areas of health, education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for culture.
Human rights must work to uplift human dignity. But human rights cannot be used as a shield or an excuse to destroy the country—your country and my country.
Meantime, since our country continues to be confronted with internal security threats aggravated by the existence and activities of the terrorist group Abu Sayyaf Group, the full force of the AFP will be applied to crush these criminals who operate under the guise of religious fervor. The AFP shall enhance its capability to search and engage these rogue and lawless elements.
We have to strengthen our coordination with Indonesia and Malaysia to suppress the kidnapping in the waters of our neighboring countries. We will strengthen our counter-terrorism programs by amending various laws on human terrorism, terrorism financing and cybercrime.
This is our answer to the challenges of the global developments on the non-traditional threats, transnational crimes and fanatical terrorism. Addressing global warming shall also be our top priority, but upon a fair and equitable equation. It must not stymie our industrialization.
We must also endeavor to develop and cultivate partnerships with nations sharing common interests and concerns with the Philippines; maintain and sustain bilateral and multilateral consultations and dialogues.
We will continue to expand cooperation on human assistance and disaster response, maritime security and counter terrorism. We shall deepen security dialogues with other nations to build greater understanding and cooperation.
With regard to the West Philippine Sea, otherwise known as China Sea, we strongly affirm and respect the outcome of the case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration as an important contribution to the ongoing efforts to pursue a peaceful resolution and management of our disputes.
On the aspect of our peace processes relating to our engagement with the international community, the Philippines shall remain committed to continue thorough working with our international partners achieving lasting peace and progress in the country.
We will vigorously address the grievances that have been time and again expressed, not only by the Bangsamoro, indigenous peoples and other groups for security, development, fair access to decision- making and acceptance of identities.
Enduring peace can only be attained only if we meet these fundamental needs of every man, woman and child.
To our Muslim brothers, the Moro country and the members of the CPP/NPA/NDF, let me say this:
All of us want peace, not the peace of the dead, but the peace of the living. We express our






willingness and readiness to go to the negotiating table, and yet we load our guns, fix our sights, pull the trigger. It is both ironic and tragic— and it is endless. While we extol the bravery and heroism of our soldiers, kayo, the rebels, do the same for your members and fighters. What I see instead are the widows and the orphans and I feel their pain and grieve, and no amount of cash assistance or the number of medals can compensate the loss of a human life. Sorrow cuts across every stratum of society. It cuts deeply and the pain lasts forever.
That is why I reach out to all of you today. To our Muslim brothers, let us find, let us end the centuries of mistrust and warfare. To the CPP/NPA/NDF, let us end these decades of ambuscades and skirmishes. We are going nowhere, and it is getting bloodier by the day.
To immediately stop violence on the ground, restore peace in the communities and provide an enabling environment conducive to the resumption of the peace talks. I am now announcing a unilateral ceasefire with the CPP/NPA/NDF effective immediately, and call on our Filipinos in the National Democratic Front and its forces to respond accordingly.
Let me make this appeal to you: “If we cannot, as yet, love one another, then in God’s name, let us not hate each other too much,” so it was said. I say the same to you today.
We will strive to have a permanent and lasting peace before my term ends. That is my goal. That is my dream.
On the macroeconomic management, my administration will continue and maintain current macroeconomic policies, and even do better.
We will achieve this through prudent fiscal and monetary policies that can help translate high growth into more and better job creation and poverty reduction. By the end of my term, I hope and pray to hand over an economy that is much stronger, characterized by solid growth, low and stable inflation, dollar reserves, and robust fiscal position.
On taxation, my administration will pursue tax reforms towards a simpler and more equitable and more efficient tax system that can foster investment and job creation. We will lower personal and corporate income tax rates and relax the Bank Secrecy Law. Eh nag-Presidente ako. Ayaw ko sanang makialam dito, sa mga ito. Alam mo na. Well anyway, may I continue.
At the household level, there must be sufficient income for all Filipinos to meet the basic food and non- food needs of their families. We shall continue to attract investments that will generate thousands of jobs each year — jobs that are suitable for the poor and less skilled members of the workforce.
Reforms to ensure competitiveness and promote ease of doing business will be mandatory.
Relaxing restrictions on the economy will be needed to make more investments to come and to develop labor-intensive industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and tourism shall be pursued.
We must also invest in human capital and ensure equal access to economic opportunities.
The implementation of the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law must be put into full force and effect so that couples, especially the poor, would have freedom of informed choice on the number and spacing of children they can adequately care and provide for,






eventually making them more productive members of the labor force.
When employment is not an option, for instance in extremely rural neighborhoods, entrepreneurship will be advocated.
We shall also enhance local business environment by addressing bottlenecks in business registration and processing, streamlining investment application process and integration of the services of various government offices.
Government Financial Institutions (GFIs) shall come up with out-of-the box financing packages to capacitate our small and medium entrepreneurs.
In the field of tourism, we shall construct more access roads and tourism gateways to service centers and tourist sites.
Road development projects shall complement with the thrust to provide modern agriculture infrastructure, expanding and improving the construction and rehabilitation of road and the irrigation and establishing modern harvest and post-harvest facilities to minimize losses.
We shall also conduct a nationwide soil analysis to determine areas most suitable for rice farming to optimize production with the use of effective soil rehabilitation and fertilization.
We shall strictly enforce fisheries laws, particularly on illegal fishing and promote aquaculture along river banks and in backyards.
On the other hand, we will accelerate infrastructure spending by improving national roads and bridges and implementing the Mindanao Logistics Infrastructure Network and other road network master plans. We shall pursue inter-island linkage projects.
We shall be implementing structural mitigation to address the perennial flooding in Metro Manila and neighboring areas. We shall put up new pumping stations in strategic places.
The revival of the operation of the Pasig River Ferry Service System is a viable option for the severe traffic congestion in Metro Manila. This serves as an alternative mode of transportation for passengers particularly those coming from the east side of Metro to reach specific destinations within the cities of Manila, Mandaluyong, Pasig, Taguig, Marikina and Quezon City.
Our anti-colorum campaign and out-of-line apprehension, including the removal of terminals will be intensified. And my God, it will be done immediately, immediately.
To address lack of road infrastructure in Metro Manila, usage of existing roads will be maximized. Thus, there is a need to cooperate and coordinate with LGUs to map out secondary routes and to consult with various stakeholders, including the public transport operators.
Many in government realistically opine, that I would have to agree, that the worsening traffic situation could be logically addressed, if Congress would also accord emergency powers to the agencies concerned.
Ayaw mo? Okay lang din. Pakita namin kung gusto ninyong madalian. Alam naman talaga ninyo sagad na lahat. Sagad na. Nasa inyo iyan. If you give it, fine. If you don’t give, we’ll take the longer route, slowly. And tanggapin ko iyong pagmumura ninyo, huwag lang sa malapit. Eh






ganoon talaga eh… it’s an urgent and immediate situation, solution. Gusto ninyo madali, okay. ‘Pag ayaw naman ninyo, because baka sabihin ninyo graft and corruption naman, ‘di okay rin.
I assure — wala ito sa script… I assure you, this will be a clean government. If that is the only worry that you have, and I can understand your misgiving.
Wala na ito sa… haba… wala na ito sa script. You know, ako makagarantiya, 101% it will be clean. Problem is I can only act through agencies and departments. That’s why I urge you na maski konting mali lang, wala akong ano doon… wala na akong politika, wala na. I’m through, after this. I just pass on to you the information that, you know, I act through Secretary and everything, I cannot guarantee their honesty and competence at all times. Cabinet members, yes. Pero iyong sa baba — procurement, iyong mag bidding diyan… but as far as I can relate… really malinis talaga ito.
Napag-usapan namin sa likod about the federal system.
You know, my advice to you is: maintain a federal system, a parliament, but be sure to have a President. Huwag, hindi na ako niyan, I’m disqualified and by that time I would no longer be here. But I can commit today, to the Republic of the Philippines and its people, if you hurry up the federal system of government and you can submit it to the Filipino people by the fourth, fifth year — kasi proseso ‘yan eh. You call for a referendum and after that call a presidential election, I will go. Sibat na ako. But you must have a president. You copy the France system. Huwag mong hayaan ‘yang puro na parliament, delikado yan. It takes time even for the—iyong kagaya ng England ‘no, because of this bomb on the double deck, took them time really because there is no one apparatus for the Commander-In-Chief down. You cannot be president, you can elect. Maybe Tito Sotto will be a lucky guy at the time. Oh ‘di, limitahan mo lang. Ceremonial powers, power to dissolve, power to offset the resolution or whatever. Mandating you this, do that… or ceremonial powers, except in times of need. If there’s a demand for action, you must have a president. Wala na ako niyon. I said if you can give me that document, I will urge you to conduct, to order a… call for an election the following day, following week. And even if there’s still two years, three years, I will go. Okay na ako. Do not worry about me. I am into… too that’s much ambitious. Eh nanalo pa eh. Hindi ko nga alam kung bakit ngayon, noon nandoon lang ako oh. Totoo man. Sino ba nagsuporta sa akin dito? Wala man. Not a single congressman, except for two provinces, governor. Iyon lang. Wala akong barangay captain, wala akong… wala lahat. Pero ngayon… [Applause]
Processing time in issuing permits and licenses shall be reduced to the barest minimum. In my city, it is always three days for local government. That will bind the Office of the President down to the last barangay. Three days, three days, local government. Business permit, clearances— hindi, teka lang. No follow up. Bigyan mo ng stub, be back next week, tignan mo iyong work load and I will require every department, iyong dito sa itaas, they must have a logbook. Huwag sa computer, okay, itong ganito na-i- erase ‘yan. Ilagay mo day, time, I accept the document of Rodrigo Duterte, then go to your computer. You must have an actuarial projection there. Look at the work load, napakabobo mo naman… oh ilan ang work load ninyo, tapos pag bumalik ka dito August 3, 3:00 o’clock, ibigay mo, ibigay mo.
Ngayon I will be establishing 8888 only for, dedicated to corruption. Pag may marinig ako sa Executive Department, even a whisper, even a whisper, hiwalay-hiwalay na tayo. Marami diyan sa, diyan sa gallery, marami diyan walang trabaho, nag-a-apply hanggang ngayon. Hindi naman lahat kasi mayayaman iyan eh, mga asawa ninyo ata iyan.






While the issuance and distribution of motor vehicle plates at point of sale or through motor vehicle dealers shall be considered. Wag na sa LTO kasi hanggang ngayon, panahon pa ni Hesukristo iyong first plate nila hanggang ngayon wala pa. Bayad na iyon, until now sa awa ng Diyos.
For the driver’s licenses, its effectiveness will be extended from the current 3-year period to 5 years.
To reduce queuing time at ticketing stations, tickets sa mga train will be made readily available and easily accessible to the riding public kung bilhin mo iyan sa malls, stalls and stores, ipinagbibili mo iyon sa… di diyan mo na ibigay, accredited. Wag doon banda sa Recto kasi sigurado pekein iyan ng mga ulol.
May I address again to the Filipino. Ako po ay doble ang pagod para sa inyo, para sa kapakanan ng bayan. Seryoso po ako. Kayong mga ganoon, tiket-tiket at magkaroon ng gulo, huwag ho ninyong gawain iyan. Ito na iyong warning ko, yun ang last. Wala ng iba, hindi ko na gagawin uli. Wag ninyong sirain iyong mga bagay-bagay na ginagawa namin para sa kapakanan ng tao. Mabuti iyang magkaintindihan tayo. Kaya wag ninyong gawin. Simple lang iyan eh. Para walang away sa gobyerno ‘yung mga bagay na illegal at masama at hindi tama, wag mong gawin at hindi kami mag-aaway dito. Pati iyong pari, pati si Pope tinamaan.
Let us be clear with each other, I am for the comfort and the welfare of the Filipinos. Kayo namang hindi pa bungog dyan, hindi pa pumasok iyang mga droga, kung ayaw ninyong mamatay, ayaw ninyong masaktan, wag kayong umasa diyan sa mga pari, pati human rights, hindi nakakapigil ‘yan ng kamatayan. So, wag ninyong gawin. Eh tapos nandiyan ka nakabulagta and you are portrayed in a broadsheet na parang Mother Mary cradling the dead cadaver of Jesus Christ.
Ayan ang mga yan eh. Magdadramahan pa tayo dito. Dito ako nakatingin kasi nandito iyong public eh. Alam mo ilang beses ko nang sinasabi yan, kunyari sa Davao, huwag mong gawin kasi magkakaproblema tayo.
He who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. Ikaw iyong nag-umpisa, you swallow—ulitin ko ha, he who is the cause of the cause is the cause of them all. Kami nagtatrabaho lang. We have a nation to guard. We have millions of people to see that they are healthy. It’s a question of drugs, it’s a question of public interest, public order. Kita mo lesser crimes, wala na kasing magnanakaw, wala na nag-holdap. Kasi para yan—bakit itatapon sabi nila eh maliliit lang iyan. Gamitin mo utak mo.
If you are able to contaminate, kagaya ng negosyo ng mga Chinese, wholesale yan sila. Maski konti- konti, kung the whole ng Tondo contaminated, pera yan. I am not saying…the Chinese the practice of itong wholesale/retail. They go wholesale, maski na kumita lang isang piso dyan, okay na iyan. Kasi paramihan eh. Yan ang ibig kong sabihin.
I hope the military and the police will not react on this…it’s part of the deep intelligence that we gathered. I am forced to come and in public kasi iyong mga pari nag-aano. Alam mo, kayong mga media, naghanap kayo ng, “Where is the big fish?” Saan iyong bilyonaryo na mayaman, iyong mga may kotse, may mga Mercedes. Ma’am nandoon yan sila sa labas, wala dito. Magdala ka ng isang battalion na police para hulihin natin doon, kung kaya natin. They direct the traffic of drugs sa kanila. Meron silang ganito, malaki, real time nakikinig sila ngayon dito. I






am 101 percent nakikinig sila dito. Saan doon? Doon lang. Isosoli nila sa Tondo, o itapon mo diyan, tapos umalis ka kunin sa tindahan yung bag o package. Di ba sabi mo nakikita ng media na… kayo lang ang nagba-brand niyan na drug lord eh. Those are not the drug lords, mga lieutenant, delivery boy yan. Kung baga LBC lang yan, pati DHL, Federal.
Pati iyong tawag nilang basura, iyon yung street ano—huwag kayong maghanap. Gusto ninyo sabihin ko sa inyo, puntahan natin. I will give you the names. I’ll show you the intelligence paper. Pero give me the guarantee na may gawain ka. Kasi I will give you the name, I’ll give you country, kung wala pa ring gagawa mag-shotgun tayo—kaya hindi lang kami ‘no. We do not get too personal about our work here. I am saying that I—dito oh, balik na tayo. Kasi iyong hindi nakakaintindi na mga Tagalog, ano na iyong, tagal naman nitong—
Passenger capacity congestion shall be addressed by increasing the number of running trains from the current 16 trains with a total of 48 cars per hour, to 20 trains with a total of 60 cars per hour; increase train speed from 40 (kph) to 60 (kph).
Ang problema nito, iyong mga railways—hindi na ito kasali diyan; huwag kayong maniwala dito. Two- thirds of this are mine, the other third is—korek iyong grammar ko. Ayaw lang nila.
Sixty kilometer per hour, problema nito, and you must agree with me that the rails are quite aged. Most of the rails maybe. Noon pa ‘yan sa panahon ni Marcos, Imelda. Nandiyan pa. Ngayon, sabi ni Tugade, “Sir, magbigay sa akin, sabihin ko 40 to 60 kilometers per hour.” Sabihin ko, “Art, sigurado ka maka- hold ang rail niyan? Baka maputol iyan, magdiretso yung tren sa Cavite. Dumiretso sa Cavite, maglipad, doon kay Tolentino, ‘Oh, bakit may tren dito sa Tagaytay?” It’s quite fast, quite fast, 60 kilometres per hour and you’re pulling something that is heavy. When it really moves … mawalan ng ano … it moves with the speed at a heavy thing at a great speed, mahirap mong … sumasadsad kasi mabigat eh. And reduce headway time from 5 minutes to 3 minutes. Mahina lang tayo ng—ang plano ni Tugade, mahina lang tayo ng one minute sa Hong Kong. Two minutes, kaniya three minutes eh. Art, ambisyoso ka. Kaya mo kaya ito?
Specifically for the LRT, the operating hours shall be extended from 9:30 to 10:30 PM. So marami pang mga bata ang uuwi niyan. And to absorb more passengers, delays in the procurement of additional trains shall be addressed soonest.
Now, iyan ang sinasabi ko. If you want to know me, fine. Wala akong problema. Sabihin ninyo na doon ang … we go the normal way. If you’re able to make purchases.
Ang maganda nito, I have signed the Executive Order sa aming FOI. Naunahan ko kayo. Yung inyo— nandoon na sa akin. Oo, tapos na ako kaya ilabas ko na. It will be out today. Alam ninyo, sabi ko, unahan ko ang Congress puro mayayabang ang ano diyan. We grab the… stealing one’s thunder. Unahan na natin.
So we shall also pursue rail projects in Metro Manila and the major key-points in the country including the Mindanao Rail Project. Hindi ako nagyayabang pero totoo talaga ito. We’re in the—depende sa federal but six years, lalabas talaga ito I assure you because it’s going to materialize. Rail projects, Davao Transit System, the Cebu Transit System, the North and South Luzon Railways and the Panay Railways project.
Panay! Eh taga-saan si ano, di Panay. Panay ang bigay natin para—sabihin naman ni Senator Drilon, bina-backbite ka dito. Lalagyan daw ang island ng train. May tawa pa. Bina-backbite ka






dito. Magsumbong man iyan. Tingnan mo, tan-awa diha.
Different approaches are also being considered to decongest NAIA including the possible transfer of general aviation.
Ang style ko kasi, ganito, hindi naman ako … I am not steeped into formalities. Itong trans- general aviation, alam n’yo kung sino ang tamaan niyan? Kayong mayayaman. Kayong may mga helicopter, pati eroplano, ilipat ko kayo. Alam mo iyong general aviation, iyong mga Lear Jet, iyong sa mga kumpaniya, ilagay ko kayo sa Batanes para wala masyadong air traffic. No. I’m offering Sangley Point. Kasi tayuan ko isang runway ‘yan. I can make a new runway there. Sabi ng mga aviation experts, but tumbok niyan is the Merville Subdivision. Maka isa pa akong runway dito sa Metro Manila. But if not there, it’s going to be Clark but on a condition that you have a fast rail. Sabi ko kay Art, it is something like thirty. One hour of travel, sabi ko kay Tugade, is not acceptable. Make a rail there, bago, marami pa. The bow of the day is bullet train. Ilagay mo iyan sa Pilipino na drayber, sa point ko, hilo. Maglampas kayo dito. The Clark Airport can be utilized to shift some operations of our domestic and international airlines.
Moreover, a one-stop shop will be established within the Clark civil aviation complex for the benefit of the Overseas Filipinos. Ito mangyari na ito. To fully utilize the Clark Airport, it is necessary to establish iyong mga … you have a rail to connect.
In the area of environment, the military is directed to intensify its –makinig kayo, sige gitawa diyan – its support role against illegal logging, illegal mining – andiyan pa naman si Gina Lopez – and other destructive practices that aggravate the devastation of our natural resources. I have to protect the country. Many are complaining against the appointment of Gina Lopez. But si Gina, pati ako, we share the same paradigm: the interest of the country must come first. But hindi ko naman sinasabi—there’s a law allowing mining. Gina Lopez and I are just telling you, follow government standards. Do not destroy the environment. Follow it to a T, wala tayong problema. Just pay the correct taxes; follow the standards.
Gina Lopez is just doing her job. You know she is really a crusader. Iyan ang … that is how I describe her persona: Crusader. Kaya sabi ko tama iyan. Bakit? Nandiyan ba si Ma’am Gina Lopez, Secretary Lopez?
Ganito iyan. Pumunta siya sa Davao, gabi na mga 1 o’clock, because on the early days of my … when I won but hindi pa ako nag-oath. Marami na nagpuntahan — solicitation, congratulations. Eh si Ma’am, pumunta twice. Every time, she shows me the degradation of … ito na nga. Tapos dalawang oras naman, mukhang hindi na matapos. Sabi ko, “Ma’am, do not be offended.” Totoo man, wag kang magagalit kay it’s the truth. So mag-a-alas tres na, “Rody, this one ‘no.” Tapos extemporaneous na, para ring congressman. Sabi ko, “Ma’am, mag-a-alas kuwatro, Ma’am. Ano kaya kung ikaw na lang ang DENR?” Bigla din siyang nag-sagot, “Totoo ka?” Sabi ko, “Umm…” Hindi yung, “oo.” Siya, siya, “I will ask the”…you know, “I’ll consult my family and ask my… ano nila.”
Following day, tawag siya kay, my aide, kay Bong. Sabi niya, “Bong, okay na tinanggap na. Sabi ng pamilya ko, okay na.” Sabi ko, “Haay, bantay ka sa … But you know, I would not be appointing somebody who is alien to my thinking. I would take in somebody who shares my horizons in life, especially iyong degradation …. Tama iyan, she’s a crusader and she will continue.
The DENR is likewise directed to review all permits granted to the mining, logging and other






environmental sensitive activities, ensure compliance with government standards and if warranted — ito na iyong pinakamaganda — amend, suspend or revoke permits. Go ahead.
I’d like to thank God that I had this opportunity, really. I never… wala namang ano, I never thought umabot ako dito. I’ve always had that crank sa isip ko mahirap itong ano.
Gaya itong Laguna Lake, naubos ng mga… wala na ang fishermen. Yun na lang the difference between one big fish pen to the other, iyon na lang ang sa mga tao. Makita mo… sa plane, every time I go to Davao and I pass by that place there. Every time, nakita ko talagang wala nang ano. And the fishermen are complaining about the loss. Talagang wala na sila. Kasi ang maliit na lugar, iyon lang ang kanila. So dito pinadaan ko lang in a diplomatic way that the Laguna Lake shall be transformed into a vibrant economic zone showcasing ecotourism by addressing the negative impact of a watershed destruction, land conversion and pollution. Ito ang nilagay ko. This is what I’m telling you — the poor fishermen will have priority in its entitlements.
Order to Gina is, “Ayusin mo, Ma’am.” Huwag mo namang ipitin, but they have to reduce the areas of occupation. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. Sila na iyong may pera, this must stop. Kung sakaling itanong sa iyo kung sino ang may ari niyan, simple lang — mga General, mga Mayor, Governor, baka Congressman. I mean, this is not personal. This is something which I feel that I must do, because it is the right thing to do.
To have adequate disposal facility for the Metro Manila garbage, the final closure and rehabilitation of the Carmona Sanitary Landfill shall be pursued while the adoption of appropriate waste-to-energy facilities will be explored. Marami iyan, the technology is coming and very fast. In the area of governance there is a need to strengthen our efforts along this line.
To better manage public information, a law should be passed, I’m addressing to Congress, to create the People’s Broadcasting Corporation, replacing PTV-4, the government-run TV station, which now aims to replicate international government broadcasting networks. Teams from these international news agencies – I’d like to mention that, those interested, BBC – are set to visit the country soon to train people from the government-run channels to observe – ito ang gusto ko, total pera naman ng tao – to observe editorial independence through innovative programs and intelligent treatment and analysis of news reports, as well as developments of national and international significance.
The government’s Bureau of Broadcast Services, better known as the Radyo ng Bayan, shall also undergo upgrading to make it financially viable and dependable for accurate, independent, and enlightening news and commentary. Radyo ng Bayan will be integrated with the PBC.
As we are presently setting up a Presidential Communications Satellite Office in Davao City, PBC will also put up broadcast hubs in the Visayas and Mindanao. Davao City will also be the first site of the first Muslim channel, called as Salaam Television, and the first Lumad channel.
The PCO shall coordinate with the Office of the Executive Secretary and the Presidential Legal Counsel in implementing the recently approved EO on the Freedom of Information. This Executive Order is out. As an example, on the part of our Executive Branch to make transparency and integrity as yardsticks in government performance, savings and expenses while engaging the public to a vigilant and to participate in government programs and projects.
The PCO, in coordination with the Office of the Executive Secretary, is drafting the






Administrative Order on the Presidential Task Force on media killings.
This government does not condone violence and repression of media. The bona fide media, bona fide media, sometime they pronounce it bona feed. But whatever that thing is, the bona fide media has always been our partner for change. Di medyo klaro yan. Hindi, anong gawin mo sa hindi bona fide media? Yan ang problema.
To address backlogs and low prosecutorial effectiveness and efficiency, the investigation and case management processes shall be streamlined, including those for illegal drugs and heinous crimes.
To eradicate the prevalent cultures of fear and silence that have hounded our justice system, I ask Congress, you, to enact the Whistleblower Protection Law while the present Witness Protection Program shall be strengthened.
Hirap maging Presidente, maski dito lang.
The number of lawyers and support staff in PAO, that is the Public Assistance [Attorney’s] Office, regional and district offices shall be increased to provide indigents more access to counsels.
At this stage, I also have directed the DILG to undertake nationwide information and campaign on federalism in partnerships with various alliances and with LGUs, civil society, grassroots and faith- based organizations.
Hinto muna ako dito, itong federalism.
Ewan ko kung tama ako. Alam mo itong bayan natin, if I may just repeat, I know that you know it. In 1521 or 1526 Magellan landed in Leyte—Kumare ko man ito, salamat mare ha.
Mindanao was already Islam by 100 years. So ano ito? It’s an imperialism thing. There is a historical injustice committed against the Moro people. We have to correct it, but it is, well, impossible now. Kaya kayong mga kapatid kong mga Moro, alam naman ninyo — ako I’m mixed, migrant ang tatay ko roon, so I’m mixed blood ako, Moro pati Christian. But you know, intindihin na lang natin ito: that we cannot return to you all iyong nakuha ng mga Amerikano, Espanol, pati iyong mga Filipino mga kapitalista, those who exploited Mindanao with that thing, sloganeering, “Go to Mindanao because it is a land of promise.” With the vast entry of so many people, basically coming from the Visayas, nagkaroon tayo ng… we cannot solve it the way you want it to be. You have to understand each other, then you have to live with each other, but we will try.
Ang sinasabi ko lang, babalik ako, dahil ako sa federalism, both Misuari, Sema and all – at least the politico leaders ng Mindanao will agree to it. We do not, remember that ako hindi ko dinidikdik yung masyadong Abu Sayyaf because it is really connected with the first talks between Misuari, the Presidents – subsequently, from President Marcos and now. Until now, until now. The only way they said that we can have this [is] iyong BBL ibigay na natin minus the things that you do not want, iyong mga constitutional issues tanggalin muna natin. Ibigay ko iyong area, nandiyan na iyan eh. So I ask you, pass it minus the constitutional issues that are contentious. Ibigay na natin at when the federal system comes, isali mo na sa package together with Misuari. That is the solution for Mindanao, nothing else. Believe me, nothing else will do. Please sleep on it, ponder on it, because that is the only way to proceed.






On the clamor of our citizens for timely issuance of Philippine passports, the government shall work towards amendment of the 1996 Passport Law to lengthen the validity of the passports from the current 5 years to 10 years. Tutal kayo naman ang maggagawa ng batas, you’re the ones who will pass the law, even if you make it good for 30 years, okay ako. Bahala kayo. Basta stretch a little bit because 5 years is just really simply on a regular basis. Matagal pa naman itong passport. Mag-apply ako ng mga 10 days—
Alam mo, I’d like to call the attention of Secretary Yasay. If you go to Davao, look back doon sa… look at the back, likod ng itong mall, ‘yung malaking mall. Sige, pangalanan na natin – SM. Doon, iyong mga tao nandyan sa pavement natutulog. For the many times nadaan ako na walang ulan, doon yan sila, because first come, first served. And the only outlet there, the outlet of your department is iyong sa SM. So iyong mga—maawa ka roon parang dito sa side ng Cotabato, lahat ng Cotabato doon sa Davao. Karamihan niyan walang mga bahay. You know, if you’re an applicant in Davao City, fine.
But you know kung walang—mahirap kasi ano. Maka-remind yan mga Moroanon, naghihiga sa mga pavement, nasasaktan talaga ako. Masakit eh. Buong gabi maghintay sila hanggang magbukas iyang SM, kasi first come first served. Kaya sabi ko—I’m addressing to all the Cabinet members: make use of the computer. I do not want to see people lining up under the heat of the sun. I do not want to people lining up under the rain na may mga ganun.
And I want itong Labor — wala na ito sa script. Iyong prompter natutulog na siguro ito, papindot- pindot diyan. Alam mo, nandiyan naman iyan. Sabi ko what I want is a journal. When the applicant presents the documents, give them a shopping list. Do not add or get anything away from it. Iyon na iyan, final. And when he complies with that, that is good. Huwag mo na siyang pabalikin. Kasi kung magtawag iyan ng 8888, my God, puntahan ko talaga kayo. ‘Yan ang bisyo ko nung mayor ako. It makes no difference kung mayor-presidente. Puntahan talaga kita at hiyain kita sa maraming tao. And I would publicly ask you what the hell happened to the procedure. Pupuntahan ko talaga kayo.
Local barangay, police, military, lahat, bigyan mo ng shopping list, ‘wag mo lang pabalikin. Because pag magtawag ng 8888 iyan, tapos makita ko na the grievance is valid, bahala ka. Anong walang panahon. Pupuntahan kita sa opisina mo and I would ask you, “bakit?”
Bigyan mo ng stub. You have to employ actuarial ability, that’s easy. Pero pagtanggap mo ng tao — I’m addressing myself, under me — journal, papirmahin mo siya, lagyan mo doon, tignan mo sa computer, magkonek ka doon sa actuarial… hindi naman kailangan ng bobo diyan eh. Kasi matatapos siguro iyan mga next month, tapos na. Projections lang naman. Balik ka dito August 15, 3 o’clock. Pagdating ibigay mo.
Now if he goes to Malacañang and open it up—for those who have valid reasons to complain about graft and corruption, the gates of Malacañang will be open. Doon ka. Magsumbong ka, at I will be briefed by my military or aide or yung si ano – itong nagbigay ng tubig, “Sir, dito marami kang…”
And the reason why I do not go out, I do not accept invitations — hindi ako tumatanggap — because every time I travel around Manila it causes a huge congestion of traffic. Kasi pati itong pag-uwi ko is… they also go by projection — paglabas ni presidente, ano yan picture taking, ganoon and they start to block the… iyong roads access to the… ganoon iyan every time ang President go out, ganoon iyan. So paparahin nila iyan, sabihin nila dadaan iyan by this time, in






the meantime sarado iyan, di paglabas ko kala mo Biyernes Santo, walang sasakyan diyan. Yun pala exponentially ang traffic, the tail-end of the traffic is somewhere, five kilo—and it would take about two to three hours to normalize. Kaya hindi ako tumatanggap nang—and I hate to travel. Kasi talagang lilinisin iyan eh. Ito namang—ang taas kasi ng entourage Presidente silan, dulo sa dulo may ambulansiya. Hindi lang entourage, parang cortege na. Sabi ko dalawa, tatlo tama na, sa gitna lang ako. Pero ang totoo mag-taxi lang ako dito sa likod, sunud lang ako. Eh takot ba sila na… ano ba ang makuha mo kung patayin mo ako? What for? May ambulansiya roon, dagdagan mo na lang punerarya.
I have also ordered the DFA to streamline documentary requirements for passport applications and open additional Consular Offices in strategic locations to decongest Metro Manila sites and avoid queues that have caused hardships and suffering to our passport applicants.
I have also ordered the newly-created DICT, Information and Communication Technology, to develop a National Broadband Plan to accelerate the deployment of fiber optic cables and wireless technologies to improve internet speed. Ito para ito sa… alam ko, Mahal kong mga kababayan maligayahan kayo nito. Pagpaano mo lang yung Tagalog ko, kasi… eh kayo hindi kayo marunong mag-Bisaya, eh di.
Wi-Fi access shall be provided at no charge in selected public places including plazas and parks, public libraries, schools, government hospitals, train stations, airports and seaports. Di ba. Happy lahat.
All government agencies are instructed to enable their clients to submit applications for coordination, other agencies combined. Taas mo, wala na iyan, ayaw mo magsalita. And national portal, yes because it’s our… parang website.
Ito: We shall intensify… mainit talaga ako dito. I place it in parity to drugs. We shall intensify our war against human traffickers and illegal recruiters that prey on our migrants.
To help ensure that the hard-earned money of our Overseas Filipinos are put into productive use, a mandatory financial education for all migrant and their communities shall be pursued along with incentives to encourage entrepreneurship among them.
I may now also ask on Congress to consider drawing up bills consolidating and merging agencies and offices all having to do with Overseas Filipinos to have a department that shall focus on and quickly respond to their problems and concerns.
Kailangan mo ng isa. Ngayon I have asked… I don’t know, Secretary Bello is here? Bebot. Wala? Absinero talaga iyan. Maski sa Cabinet absinero iyan. Gusto ko he will rent or will lease some buildings to be near sa… for overseas only. At lagyan ko na—I will direct all… BIR, lahat na. Lahat ng something to do with the clearances of the police, in one building, may booth lang. I said, “my God make use of the computer.” So doon lang siya mag-ikot sa isang building. Ang Filipino hindi na siya magpunta doon sa Statistics, hindi na magpunta doon sa ano, diyan, diyan sa office na iyan. Gamitin ninyo ang computer and you can get the results right after. Why do he has to travel to Malate, then has to cope with the traffic, he can only accomplish one document at one time.
NBI clearances is doon na ninyo ibigay. Lahat na doon na. At kung dapat… may awa itong si Bello, pakainin ninyo iyong mga tao doon, lalo na sa probinsya. ‘Pag tingin ninyo taga- probinsya, finish it right away. Make use of the computer. Kapag hindi ninyo ginamit iyan, tapon






na lang ninyo. Throw away your computers and I understand that. Make use, do the computers.
To help avoid squatter-like conditions in relocation sites, we urge utilities like Meralco and electric cooperatives to exercise their corporate social responsibility by making direct connections to relocation sites and depressed areas.
Alam mo kung bakit? Hindi na nila nilagyan diyan eh. That’s why I had to talk to you ganito. Bakit? It’s because walang kuryente pagka mahirap ka. You don’t own the land, the City Engineer will not—that is my experience 23 years as mayor. Hindi yan magbigay ng direct connection, kasi hindi ikaw may-ari ng lupa. But that squatter there has been there for 20 years. So mag-connect, connect sila. Pagka-connect- connect nila, ang gamitin nila iyong wire na… iyong pinakamura. So, it overheats because connect- connect na lang sila kung sinong… minsan magnakaw.
You know, we’ll have to make the adjustments. It is not for these people to make the corrections, because they are not in a position to do it. You have to adjust to the needs of our people. Tutal iyan namang… iyang namang squatter na iyan, as long as I sit here as President, there will be no demolitions without relocations. Hindi talaga ako papayag. Hindi naman aso iyan na—just like in Davao. I’d like to make a dialogue with the businessmen, “Sir, how much are you investing in this land, you have bought with the squatter?” So I bought it at about 60 million? Dagdagan mo ng 20 million, ako na ang bahala.
Sabihin ko doon sa mga tao, “bili tayo ng relocation site or I will provide.” Government will expropriate. I will make use of the expropriation powers. Gawa ko ganoon sa Davao eh. I have 20 hectares there. I will expropriate some land there, iyong malapit lang. Then sabihin ko, “this 20 million will help your journey to a new land.” And I will urge everybody, iyong mga bagong mga factories doon sila magtayo.
Magtiis-tiis lang muna kayo. In the meantime, to mitigate the hardships of these people – that’s the only way to do it. Pero instead of demolition, walang matirahan ang tao. Tutal you sat on your rights for many years, eh bakit ngayon pipilitin mo akong magkaproblema ng ganoon. May iba kasi hinahayaan nila for ten, twenty years they do nothing. And when the time comes na… ipagbili lang nila, eh tayo ngayon ang distorbohin. Oh ‘di gumastos ka para mas madali, just add a little bit more and there will be at least peace. ‘Pag hindi, wala iyan… fight na naman iyan between government and the… tawag nila squatters. Squatters naman talaga iyan. Masasaktan lang, mamatay for no reason at all. Eh kung mayaman ka, bigyan mo naman ng konting ano, provide a relocation and I will be glad to talk to the people and say, “go, it is not yours.”
I have directed the concerned regulatory agencies to prioritize the issuance of required permits for power development – Okay iyan sa akin. Ang problema… sandali lang ’to. Para ka diyan. Iyong mga environmentalist, mayroon tayong ano kasi… marami iyong coal, pati iyong—ito nga, itong energy emissions, wala naman akong problema diyan. But do not tell me na if you— ambassador ka tapos sabihin mo sa akin na medyo hanggang diyan kayo, kasi kami hanggang din dito lang kami. Ano? Kayo umabot diyan. You are now in the apex of your industrial might, but along the way you were the first — America, China, Europe. Kayo bongang-bonga, until now it contribute only something point zero.
So if you put so much restrictions doon sa treaty na iyan, the treaty which we are trying to… it’s still here in the Senate. Let us be very clear on this. We need to industrialize. We need the power, and therefore the emissions would also be considered. I just can’t say it. I established five economic zones here and you start to say that—you have spoken so much, carbon






footprints, mahirap iyan. I mean, it’s hard.
I cannot just agree on anything that will delay – I’m only good for six years. I intend to be something during my term. Now, I’m sure that the heavy machineries would come in and even the power. Cheapest is coal. So ito naman locally, you get into trouble with the Gina. So, we’ll just talk sa Cabinet na lang. Si Gina naman is a very fine lady. Huwag ka lang magsimangot sa harapan niya. Bigyan ka niya permit maski lima. Magsimangot ka, zero. All that she is today is just be gracious to her, that’s all. It’s a matter of talking and explaining with her. But if it is the— you are using the state-of-the-art technology, and I’ve seen it several times in the other power plants in this country, if it is really a good one, then we will consider. I said because we need the energy to power our industrialization.
To strengthen the delivery of social services, the government will intensify its social protection programs so it can use its resources and expertise to make a dent in the country’s poverty levels.
What we want is genuinely to reduce vulnerabilities of our people, build resiliency and empower individuals, families and communities.
The beneficiaries of 4Ps shall be made to become independent and self-reliant after they have graduated from the program. We aim to present them with other forms of assistance so that they can stand on their own two feet.
But now, I have decided to direct the DSWD to provide the rice subsidies to the poorest of the families – at least para makakain lang every month. Iyong sako na ano…
We are planning to increase spending for basic education and incorporate mandatory education about the evils of drugs.
We will also intensify and expand the Alternative Learning System programs. The government will also provide universal health insurance for all Filipinos benefits… Sali na lang natin sa PhilHealth.
The professional competence and operational capabilities of government hospitals and health facilities will be strengthened.
Consistent with our international obligations and in keeping with national mandates, this administration vows to protect women’s rights and human rights abuses against our women because it is unacceptable… mambugbog ka ng babae.
Thus, I order all agencies, oversight bodies and local government units down to the barangay level to fully implement the Magna Carta of Women. By doing so, we will ensure that man and woman will truly be partners in the pursuit of the country’s economic, social, cultural and political development.
To our Lumad brothers – and they are here, maybe outside. … outside I’m sure. I told the security to let them come in if they want. Sa kanila man ‘to. To our brothers I have this to say: The government has issued to you Certificates of Ancestral Domain Title covering vast tracts of land especially in the Island of Mindanao. You have the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples to protect and assist you.






The government has given you the legal tool to improve yourselves financially, economically and socially. Make use of your ancestral domain. Do not let it remain idle.
While the government is always ready to help you, you must first help yourself. We cannot legislate financial and economic progress for you. It is you and you alone who can do that. You can chart your fate, but do it within constitutional and legal means.
After being devastated by natural and man-made calamities these past few years, we are still to recover emotionally from the loss of our loved ones, and materially from the loss of our homes and income sources.
There are many among us whose emotional wounds are still fresh and painful to the touch. We cannot erase the images of death and destruction from our minds. We cannot wash away the stench of rotting flesh from our noses. And there are many of us who are still waiting for the help that was promised. The enormity of the problem of drug addiction has been made manifest by the number of surrenderees which grows by the hundreds each day that passes. Since July 1, we have already made 3,600 drug- related arrests. 120 (120,000) drug dependents have already surrendered and 70,000 (7,000) of them are pushers.
You think this is just a… it would take the entire resources of this government to fight this war. I have nothing but the interest of my country. But in its wake — because the PDEA say is that— it’s about— that was a statement made by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. Two years ago, PDEA came out with a statement that there are 3 million drug addicts in this country. That was two or three years ago. How do you think would the number, incrementally, if we count now. Give it a liberal addition, maybe… lagyan mo ng seven thousand. So, 3 million 7 hundred thousand. The number is quite staggering and scary. The drug lords that you desperately want to strangle are not here. Walang mga bilyonaryo dito. The ones that you catch, running after are just the lieutenants. They do it by technology. They’re cooking it in the international waters. Tinatapon nila iyan bulto, by the drums, dikitan nila ng GPS. So, makikita agad.
We are hard put sa intelligence, because they’ve invented this direct satellite. Hindi na magdadaan iyan ng… all they have to do is to triangulate where the… pag-ikot niyan. And there’s so many… and they’re in coves. If we do not help from our friends here in Asia and America and Europe, the sheer number and problem, believe me, will drown us as a republic.
Kayo, tignan ninyo ito. How I can I solve the problem now by arresting? Hinahanap ko… matagal na akong Presidente. Gusto kong patayin, ang problema pupunta pa ako doon, then I’ll ask the permission from this country that I will be on because I have to slaughter these idiots for destroying my country. Ganoon iyon eh. Hindi lang kasi naintin—ayaw pa naman bitawan, kasi ayaw naman kasi ng military, pati police.
But you know, I said, I’ll be talking in front of the Republic through its representatives, for the people. So I have to tell you how do we solve this problem? Tell me. Ako naman okay lang eh. Make it public, fine. Make it confidential, if you go to mayor, go to you, to your house, okay. But that is really the enormity of the problem. It’s so enormous that you are intimidated even just to make a move. Because you know you cannot stop it anyway.
Mabunggo mo isa dito, hinulog sa dagat eh marami namang nagluluto doon. It’s a free for all enterprise for the criminals at this time. Kung ako, if I had just the plane and time I could ang sinasabi ko—sabi ko roon sa military, ‘pag nakita ninyo, eh di pasabugin mo. Maski nag- surrender iyan, may white flag, pang-gyera lang iyan hindi iyan pang-kriminal, pasabugin mo.






Show no mercy to them, because they are not doing any mercy to us anyway. Bakit ako mag… iyan ang problema.
But we should not despair. Like someone wrote, it is when the night is darkest that dawn breaks.
We are imbued with resiliency that has been tested and proven more difficult times as in the past. We have to bond and act together. We have to help each other. For then and only then can we truly prevail.
And the Filipino, disciplined, informed and involved, shall rise from the rubbles of sorrow and pain so much so that all the mirrors in the world will reflect the face of a passion that have change this land.
DAGHANG SALAMAT!

STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS OF 
RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES 
SESSION HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 24, 2017]
 
Kindly sit down. Thank you for your courtesy.
When I was a member of Congress, I —- my seat was over there. The seat… The lady with a violent – — not violent but rather violet dress — seated. But I was always absent together with the Speaker and Tonyboy Floirendo, who is still absent until today. [laughter] And that started… Ay nandiyan ba? Sorry. But his propensity started almost 17 years ago when we were members of the 11th Congress.
Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III and the members of the Senate; Pantaleon Alvarez, the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, and former President Gloria Arroyo; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno of the Supreme Court and the members of courts; Archbishop Pinto and the distinguished guests of the diplomatic corps; Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; my fellow workers in government; my countrymen.
When I took my oath of office a year or so ago, I knew that our country was reeling from a multitude of problems. That day, there was euphoria in the air resulting from a successful campaign and the thought that dominated my being was to make good on my promise to the people to bring [about change] — change in government, not a change that is passing but a change that can survive the test of time.
Although I still had to know the magnitude and gravity of the problems, my feeling then was that, equipped with political will and braced by a concerned citizenry, those problems would eventually be bested by us. It was only a matter of determination and collective action. It was only a question of time.
For as I saw it then as I see it now, there is no problem in the world which can stop the march of a people with unflinching and tenacious determination. That was how euphoric — euphoric it has been.
Early on, I felt that if change was to be meaningful, it had to start with those occupying the highest positions in government because change that comes from below is more transitory than permanent. And I was aiming for permanence. Let change trickle down from [top to] bottom.
It has to be a change that is not confined merely to the replacement of people by people, but a change in the people‘s attitude, disposition and work ethic.
Sadly, although we knew years ago that what was needed or ought to do, we did not do [them] because our idea of government was parochial and we could not rise above family, ethnic and






clan loyalties as well as loyalty to friends and co-workers. No one wanted to be a snitch. That is why we are one in saying that genuine change is what this country truly needs.
I believed then, as I believe still, that progress and development will sputter if criminals, illegal drugs, illegal users of drugs are allowed to roam the streets freely, victimizing seeming with impunity, the innocent and the helpless. Worse yet, there were times in the past when the protectors of the people were themselves the perpetrators of the very crimes they were tasked to prevent or suppress. It is ironic as it is madness.
I have learned that economy surges only when there is peace and order prevailing in places where investors can pour [in] their capital and expertise. I have learned from my experience in Davao City that investor confidence [is] bolstered and fortified only if a potent force and mechanism for [the] protection of local and foreign investments are in place.
That is why, I have resolved that no matter how long it takes, the fight against illegal drugs will continue because that is the root cause of so much evil and so much suffering [applause] that weakens the social fabric and deters foreign investments from pouring in. The fight will be unremitting as it will be unrelenting.
Despite international and local pressures, the fight will not stop [applause] until those who deal in it understand that they have to cease, they have to stop because the alternatives are either jail or hell. [applause] And I will make sure, very sure that they will not have the luxury of enjoying the benefits of their greed and madness.
I do not intend to loosen the leash in the campaign or lose the fight against illegal drugs. Neither do I intend to preside over the destruction of the Filipino youth by being timid and tentative in my decisions and actions. [applause]
To the critics against this fight, your efforts will be better spent if you use the influence, moral authority and ascendancy of your organizations over your respective sectors to educate the people on the evils of illegal drugs instead of condemning the authorities and unjustly blaming for every killing that bloodies this country.
But don‘t get me wrong. I value human life the way I value mine. Each life that is snuffed out translates into future generations lost. It is like cracking the acorn from which an oak tree grows
– which, in turn, produce the seeds to complete the cycle of [life in] perpetuity.
There is a jungle out there. There are beasts and vultures preying on the helpless, the innocent [and] the unsuspecting. I will not allow the ruin of the youth, the disintegration of families and the retrogression of communities, forced by criminals whose greed for money is as insatiable as it is devoid of moral purpose. Neither will I be immobilized into inaction by the fear that I will commit an act that will expose me to public condemnation or legal prosecution. You harm the children in whose hands the future of this Republic is entrusted, and I will hound you to the very gates of hell. [applause]
That is why I ask you to join me in this fight against illegal drugs and all forms of criminality.
The government, equipped with legal authority, and you, with the moral ascendancy over the sector you represent, can do so much, and hopefully eradicate this social scourge that plagues us no end.






Look beyond your biases, your prejudices, your ambition [and] your political agenda. The search for change will begin and end only when we look into ourselves and find it within.
Today, a multitude of problems confront us. No sooner is one problem solved [when] another surges forth in its place. But we will not be disheartened; we will not be cowed; we will not be overwhelmed.
It is during trying times and troubled events that the resilience, perseverance and determination of the people are tested. The Filipino is no stranger or neophyte to situations like the one we face today. We can, and we will, overcome as we did countless times in the past, [but] only if we work together towards a common goal.
Sad to say, despite all efforts, peace, especially in the Island of Mindanao, continues to elude us. But of course, it is not the peace of the dead but the peace of the living that we seek. Peace flits away like a butterfly when you try to snatch it by the wings. And our pursuit of peace continues.
The red insurgency has been with us for decades; the Muslim issue, for centuries.
So much time has lapsed, so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has been wrought but peace eludes us still. Sometimes I am almost tempted to conclude that peace might not be able to come during our lifetime.
But believe me, it will not be for want of trying. And I will persist in our goal of attaining peace [up] to the last day of this administration and maybe even beyond although in a different capacity. [applause]
There is rebellion in Mindanao. The extremists have declared it their purpose to establish a caliphate within Philippine territory along the teachings and beliefs of [the] Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or otherwise known as ISIS. The battle of Marawi has dealt a terrible blow to our quest for peace especially now that an alien ideology and a radical shift in purpose have been injected into the local setting.
I declared Martial Law in Mindanao because I believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties. [applause] At the same time, the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to re-group in another place to fight another day, but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of Mindanao.
Martial Law and the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus enable the military to arrest, detain and question suspected members and sympathizers of the rebellion similar to what happened to the parents of the Maute brothers.
As president, I am reiterating my unwavering support and commitment to the soldiers of our Armed Forces and the members of our police force — [applause] those who are on the ground and in the battlefields and those who are risking their lives for our country and our democracy. I have your backs. To those who oppose and think that all these efforts are out of order, I hold myself — me and me alone should be responsible. [applause]






The people of Marawi need help. Caught in the crossfire between government troops and Muslim extremists, they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward.
If we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many, then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few.
At the vanguard of our struggle for peace and order are our Armed Forces and Police. They are the silent heroes who risk their lives everyday for our country‘s security. In recognition of their valor, we have crafted a program to provide them with comprehensive social assistance, including financial, should they meet harm in the performance of their duty. For the family left behind by those who fell or are rendered totally disabled in the line of duty, we shall provide shelter, health care assistance, education, and employment. That is my way of telling our troops: never fear, do your duty. I stand behind you. So does this government and all its agencies. [applause]
To decisively address insurgency and terrorism, we are working doubly hard towards [achieving] a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country. We continue to strengthen the defense capability of the AFP as a deterrence against terrorists, lawless elements, and other threats.
My fellow citizens, what I have said so far about the events in Marawi and its neighboring environs is only a part of a looming problem, which will cut across all classes and all sectors of society and eventually affect the entire country from north to south, from east to west, given the fact that Mindanao supplies a great part of our country‘s food requirements. I refer to climate change, which could bring drought and long dry spells affecting food production in Mindanao, given the fact that Mindanao is unusually warming. I ask all agencies involved in food production to look into this and act accordingly.
Also, I am appealing to all our legislators to immediately pass the National Land Use Act or NALUA [applause] to ensure the rational and sustainable use of our land and our physical resources, given the competing needs of food security, housing, businesses and environmental conservation.
Ours is a rich country. Wealth that this country is endowed with [is] a gift from God to be utilized for the [people‘s] welfare and the common good. I do not believe that this gift was given to us to be merely viewed or appreciated, but to be extracted from the earth and utilized to make life worth living.
That is why I say that it is not enough that we mine this wealth. What is more important is that we convert the raw material thereof into finished products for international and local purposes.[applause] That way, it will not only be the few who are the rich but also the poor who are many who will benefit therefrom.
Therefore, I call on our industrialists, investors [and] commercial barons to put up factories and manufacturing establishments right here in the Philippines to process our raw materials into finished products. [applause]
At this point in my administration, if possible, we shall put a stop to the extraction and exportation of our mineral resources to foreign nations [applause] for processing abroad and






importing them back to the Philippines in the form of consumer goods at prices twice or thrice the value of the original raw materials foreign corporations pay for them.
However, in the extraction and utilization of these resources, extreme care must be exercised [applause] that we do not recklessly and needlessly harm the environment. [applause] Responsible, regulated and sustainable development is what we advocate and require. The protection of the environment must be made a priority[applause] ahead of mining and all other activities that adversely affect one way or another. And this policy is non-negotiable.[applause]
I sternly warn… I am warning all mining operations and contractors to refrain from the unbridled and irresponsible destruction of our watersheds, forests, and aquatic resources. You have gained much from mining, we only get about 70 billion a year, but you have considerably neglected your responsibility to protect and preserve — and even the tax, it‘s about five percent
— environment for posterity.
I am holding all mining companies and its officials responsible for the full and quick clean-up, restoration [and] rehabilitation of all areas damaged by mining activities, and the extension of all necessary support to the communities that have suffered mining‘s disastrous effects on their health, [applause] livelihood, and environment, among others.
Ganito ̳yan eh. Medyo alis muna ako diyan sa… Sasakit ang mata ko diyan sa y*** na ̳yan. [laughter] Alam mo, you have the mining. I have to grant you a mining because you have complied with all the requirements of the law. And I cannot… I‘d be subject to a mandamus if everything is perfect and you have every right to mine. But in doing so, you destroy the rivers, you destroy the streams, from which the poor people fish — halwan or mudfish — and that is protein for the day for them.
Ngayon makita mo naman not only Gina Lopez gave you a clear picture of what was happening horrendously. Nakita mo kay Ted Failon — ̳yung kay Ted Failon, talagang nanood ako, dalawang beses. And I realized that I have to do something about it as a Filipino. [applause]
Alam mo, okay na ̳yung mining. Subsidiary ka lang ng isang another giant corporation or you‘re a sister company of a telecommunication, hindi kayo magugutom. But look at the picture shown to you. For once, they behaved correctly ang ABS-CBN. Tingnan mo ̳yung pelikula ni Ted Failon. I salute him for coming with it. [applause]
You see the palayan… Ang palayan tumuyo at ang soil nag-crack. So the farmers cannot eat anymore. They are reduced to the garbage of what you can get there, salvage anything and sell it to the scrap. Ganun ang nangyari sa Pilipino. Hindi ko kayo kalaban. As a matter of fact, you give government almost 70 billion. Pero actually maliit lang ̳yan.
Ngayon, nakikita ninyo itong mga palayan na tumutuyo and the rivers wala ng isda. The only source of protein. Hindi ka naman pwedeng mag-hunting. May makita kang eagle diyan, barilin mo, preso ka. Pakainin mo ̳yung… Saan mo ipa…?
Try to go out, sumama tayo — kayo sa akin. And try to see how hard it is for them to survive. Now ito ang… Gusto mo ganito ang pangyayari, tutal sobra-sobra naman ̳yang pera ninyo, adre, sa totoo lang. Mayor ako eh, I can look at your corporate earnings, your sister company, I can pierce the corporate identity, kayo rin pala. And even diyan sa mga newspaper. When you are not supposed






to… You know, ̳pag newspaper ka you are supposed to be 100 percent






Filipino. And yet when you start to pierce their identity, it is pala fully owned by Americans. Ganun ang nangyari eh. It‘s just a matter of piercing the…
So wala masyado ako… ABS, Rappler kayo ba ̳yan? Have you tried to pierce your identity and it will lead you to America? Do you know that? And yet the constitution requires you to be 100 percent — media — Filipino. Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up American ownership. Mayaman na kayo, mga mining companies. Ito ang deal ko sa inyo, either I will raise the taxes, ang kumikita niyan i-reserve ko to compensate for those who are suffering and in agony. [applause]
You have to come up with a substitute, either spend to restore the virginity of their source or I will tax you to death.[applause] Kasi ̳yung taxes makuha ko, talagang ibubuhos ko. Ngayon, if you can make an arrangement, an inventory of the — ̳yung nasira — ̳yung mga tao nagutom pati ̳yung river nila wala nang makuha because… You know guys, kayong mga taga-Davao we are not new to it, you want to see horror in your lifetime? Akong bahala. NPA huwag muna kayong magpagara-gara diyan, away-away kay magpunta kami samahan ko sila. You stop your
— puro hambog lang kayo diyan. Punta tayo doon sa Diwalwal, doon sa [inaudible] and I will show you the river. Up there at the source, it‘s so pristine. But doon sa — right at the start of the boundary where the millings are started, the water there is not clear, it is not brown, it is black. Your one peso will win one million from me if I am lying. Kung gusto mo isama ko kayo bukas doon. Ngayon, ̳pag tinarget tayo ng mga g***** NPA na ̳yan eh problema natin ̳yan lahat.
Sabay-sabay na lang tayo. Bakante ang presidency, bakante ang Senado pati ang congressman. Pero totoo ̳yan, you should visit the… Even the first spade, even the first spade full of earth that you extract and throw it away of no use. Itabi mo lang ̳yan diyan eh because it‘s an open pit, you dig and dig and dig, is already the first spade there is the decreasing of Mother Earth.
Alam mo ang isa pang galit sa mining? Si Speaker. He comes from a mining town but he hates mining. Ako naman kasi mga kaibigan ko ̳yung iba, ̳yung mga classmate ko mga vice president ng mining, magpunta sila dito… But it reduces into something — the damage that you have caused. It‘s not about our friendship. It‘s not about years of being in the same room. It‘s not about being fraternity brothers. But it is something that… [raises his right hand] Ganun ̳yan eh.
Alam mo ̳yung martial law, I am not so much endeavored diyan sabihin ninyo na hindi ninyo ibigay? Okay lang. Wala akong problema diyan. Maski sabihin ninyo na tama na? Okay lang. Then I will still fight. The way I will fight the war. If it is not acceptable to the normal of civilian conduct, then I am sorry because I am not fighting a civilian war, I am stopping violence and rebellion.[applause] Hindi talaga ako…
Ibigay man ninyo o hindi, para sa akin wala. Because ako, I do not intend to go beyond my term. As a matter of fact, mas gusto kong barilin ako doon sa likod. Eh hindi masyado ako itong bilib itong trabahong ito? Akala ko bilib ako. Pagdating ko ah l****, sakit ng ulo. [applause]
Totoo. Kayo nakikinig kayo. Wala akong pinirmahan ni isa, p**** i**** ̳yan na para pagkain. Pagkain- pagkain sa opisina, eh bayaran ninyo ̳yan. Maglabas ako. I do not collect anything. I do not remember. I do not sign anything there until now. Wala akong allowance wala akong tinatanggap lahat except my salary. Tapos dalawang pamilya pa ang maghati. Anong masama niyan? [applause and cheers] Sige kayo pakpak diyan. Lahat naman tayo. [laughter] I can count my… Not even the two hands, one hand lang na exempted sa rule na ̳yan. Dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima. Lokohin ninyo ako, ba‘t tayo pa ba ang maglokohan? Just because this is Congress it has






to be a secret, secret. Maniwala kayong mga ito? Pareho kaming lahat niyan. Ayaw pa tumawa kunwari. [laughter and applause]
So I will increase the taxes. Then I will think of something that will compensate or make up for the damage or at least the income restored. Otherwise, I‘ll have to stop mining. I will ask you to stop it. It‘s not good. We are a small group of islands, hindi naman marami. The coastal, marami
̳yan kasi marami paikot-ikot, but we are in a contiguous territory, maliit lang tayo.
You must remember that there are so many billions of the future generations waiting in this stratosphere. Ang gusto ninyo para hindi na kayo mandamay, huminto na kayo ng ano. Then let us go to… Because this will not end here. How about the billions and billions and billions of
Filipinos who will come after us? Kawawa naman. They‘ll have to scratch Mother Earth to eat. By
this time kung walang upheaval, no regeneration will occur, we are almost like talagang ginaganun natin ang — maliit na lang ang makuha nila. But maawa naman kayo. Makikita mo
̳yung apo mo kung ganun mo na lang… Kung ganun mo na lang ̳yung — embrace mo ̳yung apo mo sa pangalawang asawa. ̳Yung isa ganun rin. ̳Di ba? ̳Di ba, sir?[laughter] Suntukin kita diyan ngayon, liar ka.
Finally, let me make this appeal to those directly engaged in mining. Declare your correct income [and] pay your correct taxes. Believe me, your failure to do so will be your undoing and eventual ruin. [applause]
Hindi na ako makatakbo, matanda na ako. I don‘t think I‘ll even survive the five years. Pero pagka sinabi ko upakan kita, upakan talaga kita.
To our employees and officials of the LGUs tasked with monitoring these mining operations within their territorial jurisdictions, do your job without fear or favor. I [hold] you absolutely responsible for any misdeed or failure [by] the mining entities to comply — do not comply or comply with the guidelines, rules and regulations governing mining operations and activities within your area of responsibility. I mean it. Do not try to test my resolve. Absolutely I have nothing to lose except my life.
While we can control the acts of man, no one can control [or] stop the fury and rampage of weather gone wild. When nature fights back, it does so with a vengeance.
We have seen the terrible toll that Super typhoon Yolanda and the succeeding typhoons exacted in terms of human life and property. And we still have to recover from the beating that we got both during and in the aftermath of those mega-typhoons.
Aside from droughts, tempests and other problems taking shape which, according to DOST- PHIVOLCS — it is no longer just a distant possibility but a probability: Earthquakes.
The series of damaging quakes in Leyte, Surigao and nearby provinces and islands attest to this. We were told that it is no longer a question of ―ifǁ but a matter of ―when.ǁ
Thus, we need to act decisively and fast because the threat is huge, real and imminent.
Come to think of it really, they say that there is no perfect instrument or human acumen can really predict earthquake. I hope it will not come. Kasi kung magdating ̳yung sabi nila ̳yung ―Big Oneǁ, I






hope it will be just in the mountains and in the rural areas. Because if it‘s right — sabihin






nila tinatakot nila ang… Media kasi… Nandito eh in the speech, I reviewed it last night. I am calling [on] both houses of Congress to expeditiously craft a law establishing a new authority or department that is responsive to the prevailing 21st century conditions and empowered to best deliver [an] enhanced disaster resiliency and quick disaster response.
While the law is [being] crafted with extreme urgency, we need to undertake immediate action to ensure disaster resiliency and effective response in the greater [Metro] Manila area, which is our country‘s seat of governance, center of business, commerce, and the academe. Disaster resiliency of Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces is a matter of urgent [national ] concern.
Iyon nandito ̳yan, tinatakot nila dito because of the high-rise buildings and… Ilang tao ang nakatira diyan? Kung… Kaya kaya ito sa isang sinkhole? I mean if it cracks and it goes down, can we still manage to go up? God, huwag ngayon ha kay nandito ako. Hintayin mo lang ̳yan sila na lang sila dito nag-aaway. [laughter]
I am directing the Cabinet Cluster on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management to immediately work hand in hand with the concerned LGUs, the private sector and the affected communities themselves, in undertaking disaster [resiliency] measures, antidotes.
We all need to act fast.
With all the foregoing said, what then is the state of the nation today?
I will mince no words and neither will I window-dress the situation [that] we are in. Let me answer in two brief sentences. We are in — for trouble — because we live in troubled and uncertain times. And I fear that things might get worse before they become better. But like I said I hope we will cope, we hope and pray.
The West Philippine Sea issue and Federalism are matters that we have to tackle sooner or later.
On the other hand, despite our recent gains in improving the peace and order situation in the country, there is still so much to be desired and if we are to completely eradicate the menace of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption, we must do it.
I therefore ask Congress to act on all pending legislations to reimpose the death penalty on heinous crimes — especially on the trafficking of illegal drugs.
There is a shortage… No, no, no. There is a short clip of CNN about people in Massachusetts, was it there? Iyong clip nila ang ipinakita. Tiningnan… Pakitingin lang… It‘s repeated for almost every week yata ̳yang mga short clips. Tingnan mo ̳yung mga tao doon na hinayaan nilang mag… They are there, they live under the bridge, they are getting thin, they are doing nothing. Nakaganun lang sila tapos po-pose ng ano… And they are aplenty there. They do not work, wala.
Tapos sabi ng UN… Is he here? Are you there iyong UN representative? Na sinabi mo na shabu will not affect the brain? Are you here? Raise your right hand, if you‘re here. Do not worry. I will just… Do not — the word ―deludeǁ as into you… Iyong mga ano ninyo na — but we






know everyday that one family raped, dalawa and all are dead. Then you trivialize it with human rights and due process. Okay ako niyan. When you go into an anger, when you burst with rage, okay ̳yan. But with so many killings as brutal and as cruel as what happened, if you add human rights and due process, you stink and your mouth smells. If you want to criticize, criticize, condemn the act, stop there. But do not give the excuse or do not make it trivial by saying human rights at least we‘ll be protected… Iyan ang pinakab***** na magawa ng isang tao. When you criticize, stick on one topic. Then you find an event where you can talk about human rights and due process, but do not talk about it in the same time when there is a carnage and you begin to blabber, talk about human rights. Lalong nagagalit ang tao. Eh p****** i** mo. May namatay na diyan, akala mo kung sino ka. [applause] What have you done in the name of human rights? Seventy-seven — you have the records. You can summon the police. Seventy- seven before I became president. All drug- related, 77,000. And you trivialize that with a conference… At tsaka pumunta dito ang tatanungin ̳yung nasa presuhan na pinireso dahil nag –
— just imagine…
I challenge you, you want a debate in public? Okay, we‘ll have it. I will challenge you how also you trivialize the thing by — ̳yung binibigyan niyo ng importansiya si De Lima. You all know, you were all here. You conducted the investigation. You heard the witnesses. You saw the videos. Is she a credible woman? Can she be a moral person? [applause] Puro kayo drama diyan sa…
When you talk about an incident, talk about it, then condemn, condemn the police. But do not connect it with due process and human rights. Mag-mukha kang g*** sa harap ng Pilipino. You know why I get this rating? I could not be brighter than you and my work is not more important or your vocation is not less than mine. But when you talk in public carry the proper message. Kaya mag-82 kayo or kaya binobombahan niyo kasi ako ng ganun. Sasabihin naman ng mga tao, ―Eh tama ̳yan. Tama ̳yan si Duterte.ǁ Kasi nangyayari eh. Eh kayo man ang front sa pa- ganun-ganun, eh ̳pag may namatay diyan na maraming massacre, ni-rape mga babae, bata, hindi kayo umiimik. [applause] Maya-maya pagdating ng mga — [applause and cheers] pagdating nitong mga Western expert kuno, you give them so much premium and importance. Saan ba ang utak ninyo? Bakit kayo bilib diyan sa puti? Tingnan mo ang puti, panahon ni Obama, una ̳yung spokesman ng State Department. Akala mo kung sino. Akala nila mas bright pa sila sa akin. Then the staff of the President, then Obama. ―I would like to remind Mr. Duterte that the policy of…ǁ Eh ̳di yari ako. Pagdating ni Trump, ―Oh yes, Mr. President, I‘ve been expecting your call. You are doing it all right… And this G*******…ǁ [applause] Uwi na ako. T**** i*** ̳yan.
So? That‘s the value of the country that you value. Ambivalent. Parang electric fan. Okay dito o hindi na okay, it‘s vacillating. Tapos kayong mga — bilib kayo. Hindi ko talaga maintindihan ang Pilipino. It takes for an American to say that I‘m a son of a b****. And it takes for an American to say, ―Oh you‘re great. You‘re a hero in your country.ǁ O saan ako pumunta dito ngayon? [laughter]
It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect our people from these crimes that have victimized… You know, huwag ninyo akong takot-takutin niyang preso ̳yung international court of justice. S***, I am willing to go to prison for the rest of my life. Ang importante sa akin ginagaw ko ̳yung gusto ko. [applause]
Alam mo kasi in this country it is a rule of majority. I did it for the 50 plus one because in a vote of 100, I get 51, 50 plus one. Fifty is one-half, one, that is majority of one, I win. ̳Yung 49, ̳yon ̳yung mga… I do not have to make them happy. But when the time comes, eh kung malasin






ako, pupunta ako sa presuhan, do not worry about me. I can take it. Noong maliit pa ako, labas- pasok ako sa… Wala pa ̳yang law ni Pangilinan. Labas-pasok na ako sa presuhan. Kunin ninyo
̳yung record sa pulis doon sa Davao. Takutin na, ―He will be prosecuted.ǁ Hoy, abogado ako
because I will…
Sabi ko nga, everybody is entitled to come here and question me, but I have to question you also. At para magaling, let us make it official. We go to court and we tell the judge that we are hearing by an international body, can we have it judicially recorded? And I will place them under oath. Mahuli ko man talaga ̳yan sila. May pinatay ako, tama ̳yan. When I was mayor, a little over… For 23 years ako mayor ng Davao eh. Makita mo ang Davao ngayon, you have been LGUs before. What city is now hitting nine growth percent? Eh nandoon pa kami sa Mindanao, binobomba pa kami sa Davao. Davao is nine growth. Tapos sabihin ninyo… Ngayon, paano ngayon i-nine mo ̳yung — palabas mo itong nine we are about to hit six or so, sabi nila. Pero
̳pag hayaan mo lang ako, mag-abot ito ng 21, the highest in the world. [applause] Kayo lang ang taga-pigil eh.
It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect… Tapos na ̳yan. Kindly… For so long… We have to act decisively on this contentious issue.
Capital punishment is not only about deterrence. It is also about retribution. Make no mistake about that.
Iba kasi ako eh. Let us understand each other including the international community. Ang aming
— our criminal system uses the Revised Penal Code. That is a law that was given to us by the Spaniards, the original Revised Penal Code. Though it was translated into English and in this two books, three books, there are the definition of crimes and the penalties and everything. And the thrust of that Revised Penal Code, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of retribution. That is why you have penalties. There is also the word ―positivist theoryǁ that you can nurture a criminal into goodness provided he goes to prison for two years, three years, he‘s released, he‘s a sex offender. When he goes out, he rapes again, kidnaps another girl and makes her a hostage for so many years. Ganun kayo eh. Admit it, ganun kayo. You are so too lenient about this son of a b****, a human being that has a virulent brain and his enemy is society.
And many at times, there were sex offenders in America released only to rape and kidnap again and kill in just a few months after release. In the Philippines, it is really an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You took a life then you must pay for life. That is the only way to even. You cannot place a premium on the human mind that he will go straight. Nobody can. Not even your best scientist. No one has ever fathomed how a person would react especially in committing crimes. That‘s the only way to do it to instill fear, that if you do it, you will die. That‘s the advantage of criminals and rebels and terrorists because they think that you are afraid to die.
That‘s why when I went to Marawi, I was asked by the media, ―Why are you here?ǁ ―I am here because my soldiers are here and I came here to die also.ǁ [applause] Because any battle, any fierce encounter, you have to be of equal equanimity. Gusto siyang mamatay, eh ̳di gusto ko ring mamatay.
They say that they use the name of God, and the Christians say, ―we have the same thing.ǁ I read the Ecclesiastes 3. What does it say? Even during elections, there is a time to be great and a time for defeat. A time to be in the skies, emblazoned there and a time to be [inaudible] somebody. A time to have money, a time to be hard up. A time to just walk so many kilometers






to school and a time for graduation and being a lawyer. A time to be… I don‘t know what I am now. There ̳s always a time. [laughter and applause]
Ganun ̳yan eh. So I‘ll match you. ̳Pag sinabi mong, ―Gusto kong mamatay.ǁ Anak ka ng… Dalawa tayo. This bully, you know I had dinner with them sa Bayan. Itong NDF because I used to be friends really with the NDF. I was crossing the ideological borders before. Ako ̳yung nakakapasok sa teritoryo and we were friends really. But times have changed because God placed me here and I take care of a Republic. Sabi nila doon ―bullyǁ daw ako. T******* pala kayo, talagang bully ako. [laughter and applause] P***** i**. Talagang bully ako especially to the enemies of the state, talagang bully ako. [applause]
Ito pa, sabi ko sa mga sundalo, ̳yung mga human rights na ano, you are flying everywhere, anywhere ̳yung mga utak ninyo. I said, ―Take no prisoners.ǁ Which is [garbled] — ―kill themǁ. Which is correct? But you don‘t listen to my speech. This media — lalo na itong ABS — kunin lang ̳yang, ―kill them.ǁ [laughter]
̳Yan ang problema ninyo kaya minura ko kayo. Walang Presidente na p*******i** kayo because you are not behaving. Now you‘re asking me for talks… [applause and cheers] When you publish in the newspaper or quote us in media, itong mga reporters would only quote ―kill them.ǁ
I said, ―Kill them in a fight. If you have to shoot them, shoot them at the heart or the head.ǁ Sabi ko. Why? Because they will be detained here in Marawi, wala tayong presuhan. [laughter] ngayon, and the courts will always insist that they will be — that‘s the law — that they will be tried and detained in the place where they committed the crime. Kaya huwag kayong mag — patayin talaga ninyo, kasi ilagay natin ̳yan diyan sa barracks natin diyan, sa ating Mechanized Division. Pag-eskapo niyan, dalhin ̳yung kanyon natin, ipaputok pa sa atin. [laughter] Marami. How many jail — [anong tawag dito?] — jailbreaks in Mindanao, in Cotabato alone? Six.
Cotabato City, four. Ang jail doon, nire-raid tapos pinapalabas.
Alam ba ninyo ̳yan? Because you do not publish. Or itong mga taga-Maynila… Hindi kayo, mga bright kayo, bilib ako. Mga g****g****. Sabi na ―Why do you…?ǁ Why? What happened last April in Davao? It was bombed. How many were killed? Twenty-seven. Few years ago, the church was bombed twice. How many died? Fifty-nine. The airport just as the people were coming out of the departure — ah arrival — it was bombed. How many died? Thirty-two. In the war, three nuns were lining up there. I had to scoop the brain of the nun to put it in a can because the face was shattered. Zamboanga. And you say that the violation is only in Marawi? Torpe. Talaga kayong… Mag-usap tayo ngayon. Dalhin ko kayo doon sa mga biyuda. Kailan lang ̳yun?
Huwag niyong sabihin na ―It‘s only in Marawi.ǁ Rebellion has been going on in Mindanao. Walang sinasanto doon. Hindi lang ninyo binabasa nang husto. What‘s the… It‘s very porous. Kung separate islands ̳yan, maybe. Kung separate ̳yan — very porous, they can go… And Mindanao – — this is not to… The Moro has nothing to do with it, pareho tayo. Pareho tayong Maranao, so just shut up. Huwag kayong ma… Ito ang totoo.
Maraming Muslim sa Mindanao. Lahat… Eh sa Abra, meron eh. In this fight… Well, where do you think the Moro would side? Kung patayan na. They will side with government? Kung ako ngayon, kung nakatira ako, hindi kami umalis ng — hindi ako dinala ng nanay ko sa labas. I‘ll be a resident of Marawi, what do you think will be my sentiment? Sulu. Davao, puro Muslim enclaves ̳yan, there are enclaves, parang baryo-baryo. Kapag sentimiyento ang putukan, magputok ̳yan sabay-sabay.






On another thing, I‘ll talk it about in the conference. Sumobra itong Left eh. Maggawa ka ng bahay — nakawin. Ang sabi ko sa sundalo, ―Do not force the issue. I will just build yours. Ibigay mo na lang.ǁ
May project ngayon, gusto na naman nilang kuhanin. Do not commit that mistake. Here and now, I will tell you, including the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines: You do anarchy, I will order the soldiers and the police to shoot. Even if I have to bury thousand of Filipinos.
Huwag ninyo akong ganunin.
Either you‘re… Either… Let us understand this beginning today, either we have laws in this country or we do not. We enforce the laws against the miners and the rich, but I will also enforce laws against anarchy, disturbance, and create trouble. Kayo rin, natatakot din eh. [applause]
Takutin ninyo ako na occupy the streets? Anak ng jueteng. You stay there, you ask for two days, I will give you six months. Huwag kayong umalis diyan. Kainin ninyo pati ̳yung dumi ninyo diyan.
Takut-takutin mo ang gobyerno. I‘m sorry I‘ve exceeded my time, but… Eh kailangan kong sabihin eh. Para maintindihan din nila. Tutal nandito na lang rin ako sa media. Nakikinig pati lahat. Kayong mga Left, I will not talk to you. Why should I? [applause] Huwag mo na akong pilitin na magpatayo kayo mga pro-poor, shut up. Wait for two years, because I have…
You know, this is my proposal. I may be totally wrong and I will accept it, but this is mine. From now on, I will save money for the Armed Forces of the Philippines. We have lost so much soldiers.[applause] And there are thousands already incapacitated to fight. Pati ̳yung police ko, araw-araw ninyong ina-ambush. Pati ang convoy ko, kasi doon ako mag-sakay, in-aambush nila.
Pati akong — g***. P*****i**, pati ako, patayin nila. Sabagay, malayo ako doon. Pero convoy ko kasi ̳yun eh. Waiting lang ako doon sa ano… Alam mo ginamitan niyo ng machine gun. Kaya lang armorized.
Kayong mga congressman, senador na ayaw ninyong — baka may kalaban kayo. Asawa ba ninyo ̳yung katira ninyo ngayon?[laughter] O inagaw ninyo? Pa-armorize ninyo. Totoo. Proven, M60.[applause] Si… Si Senator Drilon, M60, sir. Hindi talaga ̳to maalis. Kasi binara na nila.
Nasira na lang ̳yung — ̳di talaga nila. And the soldiers inside were all there all the time, mina- machine gun na, hindi tatalab.
Mga g***, pati ̳yung convoy ko, ambushin. Hindi nila alam na nakasibat na ako. [applause] Kaya gusto niyo kong mag-usap tayo, no, sumobra kayo. Ikaw, Sison, tang … Mag-inom ka ng Tang
̳yung orange. [laughter] Matanda ka na. Kayong Pilipinas, makinig, buong Pilipinas. Kayong mga bata, kayong mga Lumad natives, itong matatanda na ito, Sison is sick. May colon cancer. Ang
gastos ng Norway, sumurender na siya. Kasi naging isyu sa pulitika eh. This government who sponsored those — who provided the good offices. Matatalo sa eleksyon dahil sa issue diyan. Kasi pabalik-balik ang mga b****, kala mo mga turista. Wala namang pinag-uusapan.
Pagdating dito, gusto ng ganito, gusto ng ganyan, ah l*** mo.[laughter] Huwag mong sabihin ̳yung meaning doon sa mga bisita. Napura na ako ba. Talagang ano ako, sir. Masyadong demanding, ni hindi naman kayo nanalo ng elections ni minsan. You cannot even hang on into a






barangay. And you keep on killing people, hindi lang ̳yung mga pulis, pati ̳yung mga civilians na ayaw magsali sa kanila.
Kaya sabi ko ano — sabi ko talaga, ―buang ka.ǁ And sinabi ko talaga. Pardon pa si…. Pi****** i** ko talaga siya the other day sa Davao. Sinong tinatakot ninyo? Katanda-tanda na ninyo eh. At lahat tayo mamatay. Kayong mga naiwan diyan sa kalsada, mabuti pa umuwi kayo. Wala kayong makuha diyan sa komunista.[applause]
Do you think that if the ISIS prevails in this country that you will have a place in their society? You must be awfully stupid, as stupid. [applause] Wala kayong makuha. Lahat tayo damay. Thank you for allowing the exhaust dito.
In our sustained effort to achieve just and lasting peace[laughter and applause]… Class, be courteous. Do not make a noise. The visitors are listening. [laughter] Just and lasting peace for a [unified] nation, we are pursuing an inclusive peace process, promoting the participation of all stakeholders, including those conflict-affected areas.
We took steps to promote inclusiveness in the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) by expanding its membership through Executive Order Number 8 which I signed in November last year.
By giving representation to indigenous peoples, women, children, and sultanates, and key stakeholders in the drafting of the Bangsa[moro] Basic Law, we ensure a Bangsamoro government that truly reflects the aspirations of our Muslim brothers and sisters as well as our indigenous brethren. [applause]
We have embarked on various initiatives to advance our national interest in the global community. We pursue good relations with all nations anchored on an independent — on an independent foreign policy [applause] — and the basic tenets of sovereign equality, mutual respect and non-interference. [applause]
As an independent nation, we will uphold and promote our national interests in the international community. We will strengthen and seek partnership with those who share our values. We will engage nations with full respect for the rule of law, sovereign equality, and again, non- interference. These are the principles that we are upholding as we advance to this year for the meeting as the Chair of the ASEAN.
We have cultivated warmer relations with China through bilateral dialogues and other mechanisms, leading to easing of tensions between the two countries and improved negotiating environment on the West Philippine Sea.
At this point, allow me to take a step back in time, in 1901. In 1901, there was known as Balangiga, and that is Eastern Samar. It was the time for Philippine-American War.
A combined group of Filipino villagers and guerrillas, in an effort to defend Samar Island from the alien invaders, attacked and overwhelmed a U.S. — a United States infantry garrison. Forty- eight American officers and men were slain in the attack. On the Filipino side, the casualty count was twenty-eight killed and twenty-two wounded.






In retaliation, U.S. gunboats and patrols were sent to Balangiga, Samar with the order to
―…make a desert of Balangigaǁ and to reduce Samar Island into an island of ―howling wilderness,ǁ where every male citizen from the age of ten and above, and capable of bearing arms, would be put to death. The Church bells of Balangiga were seized by the Americans as spoils of war.
Those bells are reminders of the gallantry and heroism of our forebears who resisted the American colonizers and sacrificed their lives in the process. Krag against bolo — krag was the standard rifle issued to the American troops. And that is how the historians describe.
[Nauna ka, pababa mo. Hindi, baba mo, tumataas ̳yan.][laughter] Mahirap talag kung director ka, ikaw pa ang speech.[laughter] Many historians describe — [sige] the Philippine-American war. That is why I say today; give us back those Balangiga bells. [applause] They are ours.
They belong to the Philippines. [applause] They are part of our national heritage. [applause]
Isauli naman ninyo. Masakit ̳yun sa amin.
We now talk about our Overseas Filipinos. They are our heroes. They and their families have sacrificed much to the — for the country. We all know how a large part of our economic — economy comes from their remittances. That is why to ensure that their rights are protected, I ordered the increase of our assistance to the OFW from 400 million pesos to more than 1 billion. [applause]
We have been hard at work in securing the rights and welfare of our OFWs.
A year ago, I also warned government officials and employees that I will never tolerate corruption in my administration, not even a whiff of it. Let the dismissal of several high-ranking officials — whom I myself appointed — serve as a warning to all that I will never back down on my commitment to cleanse this government and corporation. [applause]
In order to bring government services closer to the people, we established hotlines [and] government centers that receive public concerns, one of which is the Hotline 911, which allowed us to receive and immediately respond to emergencies.
We also launched Hot — launched Hotline 8888, the Citizen‘s Complaint Hotline. This is a public hotline facility that receives feedbacks or concerns on government services.
Since we launched this hotline, we have received numerous complaints from the public on government — slow government processing, unclear or changing procedures and requirements, centralized issuances of clearances and permits in Metro Manila and discourteous government employees, among others.
Ganito ̳yan. Time and again, ̳yung — ̳yung pag-transact ng ordinaryo — no, the ordinary people who contract business in government. In the last ASEAN Ministerial Conference, I don‘t know why Malacañang has to — my office has to do some work for — or the others, like itong mga barong. It‘s always the — that outfit takes care of the attires that will be given to the ministerials, this time, to the heads of state.
Alam mo, I‘d like to address this myself to government. Iyan bang bayaran, pabalik-balikin ninyo ang tao. Alam… I know that because I‘ve been mayor for 23 years, I never allowed it in my city.






But dito, alam mo ̳yang mga sastre diyan sa Parañaque hanggang Cavite — ̳yung mga tailoring diyan — ang negosyo lang niyan involve boy scout, teachers‘ uniform, girl scouts, naghahabol ̳yan sila ng mga kontrata.
And they are just the — the stores that you find along the way until Cavite. They group together during times of ganito, may ASEAN. And they look for a person to represent them.
This is not — no offense intended but — usually, they look for beautiful women, young, who would do the talking, arrangement. You know, because it‘s the… Well, it‘s the reality of life, that the beautiful women get the attention always.
Tapos, ̳pag na-deliver na nila, nasukatan na, pabalik-balikin ninyo. And right there in Malacañan, it happened. So, I will fire the lady, whoever was connected with her, as I have fired everybody else. A Cabinet member for buying an 18-million truck in Austria. That was not our contract. It was a contract of the previous administration. Fourteen of those 18 million were already delivered.
This Cabinet member was… I was informed about and I said the legal — his legal office — to stop
it. You know what? He went just right ahead, traveled there, signed something for the — another tranche of delivery. So right there at the meeting — right in the Cabinet meeting I said,
―Were you able to read the opinion of your law — your own law office?ǁ He said, ―No.ǁ But Sonny Dominguez was already passing to me the — ̳yung sa iPhone. So I was reading it while I was talking to him. Sabi ko, ―P***** i** mo, you‘re fired. You‘re lying.ǁ And so I fired him, ―Go out of this office. I do not want to see your face again.ǁ Ganon ako ka-istrikto.
So ̳yung — the Cabinet members — and they are here — they‘re only given, noon, one year, two years — one month. The directors, makinig kayo sa gobyerno, bantay kayo. Directors, you‘re only given 15 days. And I do not want directors out of their office, you eat your lunch there, lahat kayong taga-gobyerno, so that you can resume to work immediately. [applause]
Now, ito ang deal ko sa public. There is the 8888. I cannot stop corruption and wrongdoings if you do not cooperate. You text me. Libre ̳yan — 8888. You name the public official, name his sins in that bulletin, and I will take it from there. Do not be afraid about libel, I will take care of that. [applause]
Iyon ang gawain ninyo. I have to have your help. Kung hindi kasi kayo mag-ano, wala eh. Lahat. Pulis, military, lahat, pati ako. If you think that some of — may nagawa ako na masama, sabihin ninyo. Do not be afraid.
We are all workers of government, kayo ̳yung employer namin. [applause] We get the money from your pocket to our pockets. Kami — kailan pa… Since when have you heard me talk about government and officials? I always address everybody, ―workers of government.ǁ
I seldom mention ―Malacañan Palaceǁ. It is not a palace, it is just a house of wood. So, why should I call it a palace? Maybe something like the European-style. I just call it office. Palace, palace ka diyan eh. [laughter] And besides, all the rats of Pasig are there. [laughter]
It‘s just beside Pasig River. So ̳yung lahat ng mga daga diyan kung saan-saan, doon nagla- landing. It has a wild field, and they are not killed because they are Presidential mouse. [laughter]






Iyon ang sabi ng — iyan o sundalo. ―Sir, ̳di daw ipagbaril kay Presidential mouse.ǁ P***** i**, mabuti pa ang mouse dito kay hindi pa pinapatay, ̳yung tao kinakatay ninyo.
The people‘s patience is wearing thin, so is mine.
I am reiterating my directive to all government agencies [with] frontline services to our people — from womb to tomb — to further streamline their respective services to make these truly efficient and people-friendly.
We want to ensure that our people receive the quality services that they surely deserve minus the delays by the bureaucratic red tape. I expect speedy reforms along this line.
We‘ll rightsize the national government. Let us trim the excess fat and add more muscle through the expeditious passage of ―The Act Rightsizing the National Government to Improve Public Service Institute.ǁ [applause]
I therefore urge Congress to pass this at the soonest.
For the Government Owned and Controlled Corporations — isa pa kayo — the implementation of the existing Salary Standardization Law pending review in the Compensation and Position Classification System. Excessive, extravagant, and unconscionable salaries and allowances, incentives, benefits and bonuses across the Government Owned or Controlled Corporations at this time, in crisis.
You‘ll have to pass by my office and I am not inclined to increase your allowances, bonuses, and salaries at this time. Wala ̳yan. [applause]
You cannot do it on your own. You have to direct it to the Executive Secretary. And I‘ll just tell you, I am not inclined to give increases right now. Maybe seven years from now, when Drilon makes it to the presidency.
I also appeal to the Supreme Court to seriously consider the national interest and our development goals before issuing TROs and injunctions on critical government projects and cases involving government assets.
I am just a co-worker also, ladies and gentlemen. May I be allowed to be also just as frank? Tutal wala naman akong ina-ano, eh. I do not need to offend you.
But I cite, for example, the Supreme Court TRO that prevents the Department of Health from distributing subdermal implants, which caused a wastage of P350-million worth of taxpayers‘ money. I also note that since its issuance two years ago, this TRO has impaired the government‘s ability to fully implement responsible planning — family planning methods in the RH Law.
It is time that we put an end to the practice of some parties of resorting to technicalities in our laws to prevent the government from fulfilling its mandate.
Ganito ̳yan, ma‘am, eh. Tutal, this is as good as any other time to talk to you. And may I be understood by you — I am sorry to say this, really, I am — I do not intend to do it. But if we have






to talk about government and our sins, which I am not an exception, all our — you know — delays, lahat naman tayo nagkakamali.
Ganito ̳yan, two things. Wala na talaga akong panahon. I‘ll just stay… I don‘t know if I can make another SONA again in the future. It‘s — it‘s not for me to tell.
Itong TRO has been the bane of projects. And even Consunji, ̳yang mga Ayala, nag-aaway
̳yan. Just to make you understand na hindi lang kayo. Tapos, ̳yang TRO na ̳yan would delay the projects. Now God — and I‘m asking Congress, find me a law na kung may bidding naman at it was regular, dapat ang korte or somebody else should not be messing it up.
Because it can delay the projects, which has been the case in the provinces. Alam mo, mag-file
̳yan ng kaso — either it is really the truth and the COA will find out or makihati siya — ―I will withdraw the case and dissolve the TRO of course. But just give me a few — 10 percent.ǁ
Ganun ang ugali ng Pilipino. Kaya ̳yang TRO na ̳yan is the bane of our efficiency, and I really do not know whether… I will not attribute anything, ma‘am, sa Supreme Court.
Maybe I am at fault so I am sorry if I misquote or I did not have the complete facts. But itong Congress na ito passed the Reproduction Law. It was already a law na dapat i-implement because we are really going into a family planning. I am not for abortion. I am not for birth control. But certainly, I am for the giving of the freedom to a Filipino family the size ng pamilya niya. [applause]
How many children would he be able to support and send to school? Ang nangyari nitong TRO , sir, ma‘am, may nag-file doon sa inyo — Supreme Court — tapos nag-issue kayo ng TRO two years ago. In the meantime, ̳yung — ang gobyerno, nagbili ng medisina — ito subdermal pati itong mga pills worth 360. It was not really a reckless purchase. It was in preparation for the implementation of the law.
Hindi naman akalain na mag-TRO and it has been two years. The medicines will expire next month. I told Ubial, the Health Secretary, to find out if there is a nation who — which would allow it and i- donate na lang rather than go to waste.
Iyan ho ang nangyari. I do not blame you. You might have been very busy or something. Wala. Ako, I ̳m just… I am below you, actually. Pero sinasabi ko lang. May isa pa.
Huwag na lang itong speech, walang kwenta, walang makukuha diyan. [laughter] The bane — isa pa itong — the Congress and tayo sa gobyerno, including the judges and justices, should understand that by this time, ̳yung lowest bid, ̳yun ang nagpo-promote ng graft and corruption sa ating bayan. [applause]
COA, you are here. Malaman na lang ninyo na may violation ako. Doon sa military, I do not allow them to bid and just to buy the weapons from everywhere, because almost all countries are making arms. Tawag nila, small arms industry. We‘re just fighting a rebellion. True, we do not need the armaments.
But diyan sa Marawi, you have to hit hard because they are prepositioned inside buildings. And until now, we cannot proceed fast because there are 300 hostages. Sabi ko, ―Do not assault. If necessary, we‘ll just have to wait. Wait it out.ǁ






But we have to give food. You do not — I do not care if they are Moro or Christians. It‘s not… We do not have that luxury. Kasi ̳pag — there is a distinct possibility that we attack, they will just behead everybody.
So, find a way to do it. If you cannot find a way to do it then just I said, ―Wait it out.ǁ Sila ang nakatagal. Baka sabihin hindi marunong itong sundalo. Ako ̳yung pipigil. Initially, sabi ko bomba. ―Eh, sir, hindi talaga madala, sir.ǁ Every window is occupied, ̳yung high-rise. And we were losing because of the snipers. And in there, they hurry, I said, ―Slow down.ǁ
When I was — hindi ako nagyayabang — when I was in the camp sa Ranao, while I was briefing — I was being briefed by the military and was giving the instructions, I heard about 16 pumutok at tsaka ̳yung bala na, ―Weng, weng, weng!ǁ Iyong mga reporter nandoon sa likod ng stage kasi semento ̳yun eh. We will ano… Sabi ko, ―If this is how we should wait, then we‘ll wait. Unless you can find a solution — somebody here who has a good, even a horse sense to negotiate for the release of…ǁ
Ayan itong isa. Babalik ko ̳yung lowest bid. Alam mo ganun ̳yan adre eh. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid, ̳yung walang pera. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid, sasabihin niya doon sa ano, ―Magbibigay po ako sa inyo.ǁ Kung sinu-sino ̳yang mga opisyal. So, lowest bid papanaluhin siya. So, with no capital, bibigay siya ng pera. Tapos ibigay, lahat bigyan niya, connected — lahat. Pagkatapos niyan, if it is a 100-million project, he has to pay so many guys, ang naiwan niya 100 — – out of the 100, 40 million lang, so that is the cost of the project.
So, when I was campaigning for the Presidency, I was all over the Philippines. My God, I could see a — the appropriation, pero ang airport nila, three meters long. So ginawa na lang basketball court. [laughter]
And there is a province here. Hindi kayo, not you. If you look into the records back in time na puro na complex ang roads diyan. Talagang daan dito, daan doon. Pero ̳pag pumunta ka, isang daan lang. It‘s only one highway. That is how corruption destroys the nation.
Ngayon, last. I have to say this. Kailangan ko siya sabihin, sir, eh. I was elected June 30, nag- oath ako. So, July nagpunta na ako sa Davao — sa AFP Medical Center. Nakwento ko na ba ito sa inyo, hindi pa? Tapos sabi ko — it‘s quite familiar, kasi I signed a letter nung mayor ako. Sabi ko, ―May MR(I) ba kayo?ǁ Sabi nila, ―Wala, sir.ǁ Sabi ko, ―May state-of-the-art ba kayo na X- ray?ǁ Sabi, ―Wala, sir.ǁ Sabi ko, ―May hyperbaric ba kayo?ǁ That‘s the chamber where you are placed inside if you suffer the bends, ̳yung nagdi-deep dive ka. But it is also high-pressured that can arrest gangrene, especially those who are extracted from the field of battle about two days na, gangrene sets in. So, they are placed there. And it can work miracles for a wounded soldier. So, in one upuan, in one sitting, you did this…
Then, I saw the building and I went inside. Iyong drainage nila, bumabalik. So I said, ―You know, I am really surprised. You‘re military men, why would you allow that kind of…ǁ The dirt is going back to… How do you expect the sailors to — the soldiers to get well?
Tapos, that‘s the only building. The old — the oldest. I said, ―Okay, you rehabilitate it. I‘ll give you a new one in the meantime.ǁ But last month I went to the back of my office, doon sa barracks ng Presidential guards. So, we were groundbreaking for the hospitals of the soldiers. And I asked the soldiers who were there also from V. Luna, ―Are you now using the equipment?ǁ






Alam mo ang sinagot sa akin, ―Sir, tayo-tayo na lang ang mag-usap huwag na ̳yan sila. T**** i**, wala pa. Hindi pa na-deliver.ǁ Sus.
Sinabi ko, ―If this is the way how you treat our soldiers and they are dying now and that machine was ordered a year ago, and then a coup d‘état, a mutiny is not a surprise to me.ǁ
Kaya sabi ko kay Ubial, hindi niya kasalanan it‘s because of the procurement. Pero ganun… Is Secretary Ubial here? Are you here Secretary? Change the procedure because I will change you.[laughter]
Talagang mag-coup d‘état ̳yan. Marami ng… We are losing about… By this time meron, every –
— everyday we lose about 10? Everyday. Sometimes I say it‘s a useless war. There is a rebellion. Sabi ko maski kung ako ang sundalo niyo and there is a machine already ordered it could have save my leg, tapos wala ma‘am, ay p**** i**, mag-coup d‘état ako.
And let us get the machine by ourselves. I will not be surprised if it‘s already in their minds. Ako, I am only be too willing to step down.
But as a long-term solution, I urge Congress to thoroughly review our existing procurement laws and come up with legislation that will ensure the prompt delivery of quality goods and services to the people, especially medicines and hospital equipment. [applause] Kasi itong military ang sabi ko do not mind COA about I will answer for that. Since COA is here I limit it to three places where the military can buy the equipment. Because I‘m sure that we will work and they can kill the enemies and make even our forces stronger or in parity with what they have on the other side.
Itong armas sabi ko huwag mong sundin ̳yan. I will explain to COA why. Huwag mo akong pabibilhin diyan sa mga lugar ng South America at lahat diyan sa mid-European —–Eastern European countries are also… There are good ones but I limited them to —- especially
equipment in listening kasi kung magbili ka doon sa iba, nakikinig rin sila, sabay na kayo. Tatlo na kayong nagko-communicate. Tawag sa Bisaya, ―brin.ǁ
Our laws should support, and not impede, national development in a speedy and sustainable manner.
In our bid to accelerate human capital development, we seek to ensure lifelong opportunities by enhancing the quality of and access to education and training programs.
We have sustained investments in higher education and committed to the full implementation of the K to 12 Basic Education Program. We have widened the reach of skills training and increased the number of out-of-school children and youth who have availed of the Alternative Learning System.
To ensure that Filipinos are given equitable access to quality and affordable health services, we expanded health insurance coverage and benefits. The destitute and the indigents, or those who just could not afford hospitalization, can now be provided with free services by government- operated, public hospitals as we have strengthened the implementation of the No Balance Billing Policy. [applause] Kayong mga Pilipino na nakikinig sa akin ngayon magpa- hospital kayo ako ang magbayad tutal hindi naman nila ako mademanda. Pasok lang kayo doon occupy the hospital sabihin mo lang — totoo ————————- pasok kayo ng hospital sabihin ninyo na sabi ni Mayor






Duterte pagamot daw kami siya daw ang bahala magbayad. [applause] Marami tayong tresurero dito. [Ah huwag na ̳yan iba naman sa taas na.]
I have signed Executive Order No. 26 imposing a ban on smoking in public places to mitigate its consequences. [applause] We want to minimize access to tobacco products, and provide a more supportive environment for those who are attempting to quit tobacco use.
Alam mo bakit? Tinamaan ako ng … ̳Di ba ito, I have been very frank with you. I have a Barrett and I have a Buerger‘s disease, caused by smoking. So ang problema niyan — in a survey in the Philippines and all over the world, why is it that the women force — workforce in an office and the men have acquired in equal, almost in parity in numbers sick of cancer.
And it was found out because the poor girl has also to — inhale your smoke. Kaya [inaudible] ko sa Davao… In Davao you cannot see a person there walking with a cigarette. Foreigners, they are very – — they can argue with you, say that, ―This is my money not your money.ǁ Sabi ko,
―Then, okay. Eat your money or I will shoot your b****.ǁ [laughter]
Investing in the health sector is never a cost to be endured but an opportunity to be explored.
If we are to embrace the vision of a prosperous Philippines, we have to start putting value to our people‘s well-being – because the success of every Filipino‘s pursuit in life, liberty and happiness directly mirrors the fulfilment of our aspirations as a Filipino.
I would like to reiterate my personal and this administration‘s commitment to fully implement the Magna Carta of Women to the barangay level tapos na ito. [applause] To this effect, an executive order will be issued to local government units institutionalizing gender and development programs and services.
We are targeting to increase Government spending on infrastructure from 5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 7 percent of GDP by 2022, amounting to a total of 8 to 9 trillion pesos or 160 [applause] to 180 billion dollars in infrastructure projects. We will make the next few years the ―Golden Age of Infrastructureǁ in the Philippines to enhance our mobility and connectivity, and thereby spur equitable growth and development in the country. In other words, we are going to Build, Build and Build.
To improve our sea connectivity, we launched 15 brand new RORO vessels to ply major nautical routes all over the country. We also opened an ASEAN Ro-Ro Shipping Route connecting the ports of Davao and General Santos, Philippines to Bitung, Indonesia.
To address the congestion in our sea ports, we modernized the Ports of Iloilo, General Santos and Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga. We shall complete strategic road and bridge projects and some of the road sections shall be widened and improved to address the worsening traffic.
Alam mo si Ma‘am Grace, you are pushing for… You know, when I became President, EDSA was already horrendous as it was a horror of the other administrations.
Now, I brought in Tugade because Tugade to me is a bright boy. He‘s a billionaire. He was my classmate. Ewan ko kung nandito siya. He was our valedictorian in the law class. Talagang mahusay.






But we needed money and we tried to get your help to raise money. Ayaw naman ibigay. Eh ̳di hanggang ngayon nandiyan pa ̳yung EDSA. Okay lang, at least gumanda lahat mag-iwan naman tayo ng pangit. We will not make it all smooth in the Philippines. We leave a little alley known as EDSA as the road to perdition.
But anyway since I could not get any funding. I traveled to China and make friends with them, and the ambassador is here, Ambassador Zhao, thank you for the help. And as a matter of fact [applause] willing… He said, ―If your Congress has no money, we will give you the money.ǁ And China has committed to build two bridges to span Pasig River, free of charge. [applause] So that you will be comfortable in crossing Pasig.
Anyway, all of these strategic road and transport projects shall go to naught if we cannot free our streets, which continue to be obstructed by illegally parked vehicles, ̳yang EDSA na ̳yan traffic obstructionists or undisciplined drivers who stop in the middle of the road, and unsanctioned barriers in some areas.
I am directing the MMDA and the LGUs of Metro Manila, as well as the LGUs of Metro Cebu and of all our regional centers, to ensure the free flow of traffic, and immediately clear our roads and thoroughfares of all unnecessary obstruction, including vehicles parked on the streets and barriers — [applause] [not] sanctioned by the Government, and penalize all traffic obstructionists regardless of stature…
Sometimes hindi mo maano diyan because the police, it‘s a Cabinet member. Pero may I have not – — authorized my Cabinet member to utilize the low plate. Is it not for us to, you just use an ordinary plate, para walang masabi ̳yung tao. I do not want you parking there when there‘s no parking. Please remove…
Airports, we are building new airports. We might get some money also from China and will have new airports in the coming days.
We are now accelerating the implementation of the Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management System project, which will result to on-time arrivals and departures, better managed air traffic, reduced flight operating costs, and safer and more convenient travel experience.
Revenues are the lifeblood of the government, which enable us to provide for the people‘s needs.
Last May 31, 2017, we achieved the first step towards more equitable taxes to fund better services for the people. I commend the House of Representatives [applause] for heeding my urgent certification of the tax reform by passing the first of five packages of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program with an overwhelming 246 votes, representing almost [90] percent of the Filipino people.
The fate of the tax reform is now in the hands of the Senate. Ano bang gustong ninyong gawain, mag-luhod ako niyan? Well, really I‘ll leave it up to you. We are all Filipinos. If you think that‘s a waste, fine. If you think it‘s not good, it‘s okay with me. I can survive.






[Next] I call on the Senate to support my tax reform in full and to pass it without haste [applause]. Ayaw man magpakpak — ah pati si ano wala, they are not clapping so. Si Angara ayaw rin mag- clap. [laughter] Bantay ka lang sa election tingnan mo. [laughter]
These reforms are designed to be pro-poor, especially when the people understand how the revenues will be spent.
The passage of the Tax Reform Law is needed to fund the proposed 2018 budget which I am submitting here and today.
The poor and vulnerable [applause] are at the heart of my tax reform. Your full support will ensure that the benefits of the tax reform can be felt immediately by them.
In the meantime, the Department of Finance and Bureau of Internal Revenue are strengthening and running after tax evaders. [applause]
I have directed the Department of Finance and the BIR to accept Mighty Corporation‘s offer of P25 billion to settle its tax liabilities. [applause] After the settlement, Mighty will no longer engage in the tobacco business.
This will be the biggest tax settlement on record. [applause] It will produce a windfall for government, which is significant, since we face the unexpected costs of rebuilding Marawi and Ormoc.
The acceptance of the tax settlement offer does not preclude other criminal charges against the company that the BIR may decide to file. A settlement will allow government to avoid a long [court] battle that, as we saw in previous cases, could take years to resolve.
Let this be a lesson to others. This administration will spare no one found cheating the government of its due.
We view Information and Communications Technology or ICT as an effective medium to implement positive and meaningful changes in our society.
To this end, my Cabinet approved the National Broadband Plan of 2017 to begin the work of bringing affordable Internet access to every community and improving broadband connectivity in the country.
We have also installed free Wi-Fi Internet in almost 400 public places around the country. [applause] We hope that the public will use them to access important information and services.
The National Government Portal, which we launched recently, will allow faster and easier delivery of public services and reduce the number of visits of the public to agencies for government transactions.
The Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Migration Plan has also been launched. The switch to digital from analog transmission will not only give a better TV viewing experience but also provide effective and reliable information to Filipinos in times of calamities.






The government-owned Salaam Digital TV, the first Muslim TV in the Philippines, is now already on test broadcasting. [applause]
There are some of the things we have done for the past twelve months. A more detailed narrative is contained in my Report to the People, will be released soon. Whether or not my first year of administration was a year of gains or a year of setbacks is not for me to say but for the people to judge. I defer to the people‘s judgment [applause].
My fellow citizens, much remains to be done. Corruption persists like a fishbone stuck in the throat. It pains and it is disconcerting. We need to pry corruption from the government corpus [where it] is deeply embedded. We also need to put an end to squabbles and bickerings within agencies [and] focus fully on the speedy provision of quality public services to our people.
Believe me, it is easier to build from scratch than to dismantle the rotten and rebuild upon its rubble.
Nevertheless, let us work together and lay a new foundation upon which a better Philippines can be reconstructed. Help me build a better tomorrow.
Let me end… Gusto ninyo uwi na tayo? O gusto ninyo ng kwento? Marami pa akong ikwento sa inyo.
Let me end by wishing everyone in the language of the old: ―May God keep us forever sheltered in the hollow of His hand.ǁ
Salamat. [applause] — END —

STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS OF 
RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE 
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 23 July 2018]
Kindly sit down. Thank you for your courtesy.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the members of the Senate; House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo; His Excellency Gabriele Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio and the justices of the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga kababayan.
About two years ago, I solemnly took my oath as a worker of the national government. I was as inspired to institute real changes for the greater good of the Filipino people, as I was greatly overwhelmed then by the daunting challenges that lay ahead.
Two years later, my solid commitment to directly and decisively address our nation’s collective challenges remains. It has not wavered. In truth, it has even gotten stronger through adversity and the desire to give the people the most we can, within my term in this government.
Let me begin by putting it bluntly: the war against illegal drugs is far from over. Where before, the war resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs worth millions of pesos, today, they run [into] billions in peso value. I can only shudder at the harm that those drugs could have caused had they reached the streets of every province, city, municipality, barangay and community throughout the country.
This is why the illegal drugs war will not be sidelined. Instead, it will be as relentless and chilling, if you will, as on the day it began. These drug dealers know fully well that their business is against the law. They know the consequences of their criminal acts, especially when caught in flagrante delicto and they violently resist arrest. They know that illegal drugs waste away lives, dysfunctionalize families, and ruin relationships. They know that once hooked, addicts will die slowly — slow deaths. And yet, they persist in doing what they do, oblivious to the terrible harm that they cause to the people and communities.
And when illegal drug operations turn nasty and bloody, advocates of human rights lash at—and pillory—our law enforcers and this administration to no end. Sadly, I have yet to hear really howls of protest from the human rights advocates and church leaders against drug-lordism, drug dealing and drug pushing as forceful and vociferous as the ones directed against the alleged errant [law] enforcers in the fight against this social scourge.
If you think that I can be dissuaded from continuing this fight because of [your] demonstrations, your protests, which I find, by the way, misdirected, then you got it all wrong. [applause]
Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives. [applause] The lives of our youth are being wasted and families are destroyed, and all because of the chemicals called shabu, cocaine, cannabis, and heroine.
Human rights to me means giving Filipinos, especially those at the society’s fringes, a decent and dignified future through the social and physical infrastructures necessary to better their lives.






The lives and freedoms and the hard-earned property of every Filipino whose condition we wish to improve shall be protected from criminals, terrorists, corrupt officials, and traffickers [of] contrabands.
You worry about the present; I am concerned [about] both the present and the future. [applause] I worry about the future because I know what crimes can do to the youth of this country. If not stopped, crimes can make human cesspools of succeeding generations. I will not allow it to happen. Not during my term.[applause]
Time and again, I have stressed that corruption must stop. [applause] Corruption is like a leech that it bleeds the government of funds programmed for its infrastructure and other social development projects. It saps the morale or the morale of dedicated and honest government workers.
Corruption destroys those who succumb to its temptation and eventually it is the innocent who will suffer and bear its horrible consequences.
The love of money is corrosive. And sadly, the desire to make the easy kind by being imaginative and manipulative, corrupts absolutely. Stolen wealth does not make the thief respectable. Neither will the trappings of wealth mask [nor] cap the stink that thievery exudes. One day, justice will catch up with those who steal government funds. And when that day comes, it will be the public who will have its retribution.
While we run after those who steal the people’s money, we are also enhancing the government’s delivery of frontline services. I thank Congress for the swift passage of the Ease of Doing Business [Act], [applause] which is a significant fight against corruption and improving service delivery. We need to sustain our momentum. And I hereby direct all [local] government units — makinig sana kayo — and government agencies to faithfully implement this law and simply simplify the process. Hinihingi ko ho ‘yan sa lahat nasa gobyerno under my control and supervision. Huwag ho kayong magkamali.
I particularly call the attention of the agencies with the [most] number of red tape-related reports from the public, make your services truly customer-friendly. Our people deserve efficient, effective, and responsive government services. They deserve nothing less. [applause] Kayo lang ang ayaw eh. Gusto ng tao kayo ‘yung binabayaran, make your living from the pockets of the people, and you have a lousy and corrupt bureaucracy.






I have friends and political supporters whom I appointed to public office and then dismissed or caused to resign. I need not mention their names or recount the circumstances surrounding their removal or resignation. Media has more than amply reported that.
I value friendship, make no mistake about it. But it has its limits.
This is a lonely place I am hemmed in. Do not make it lonelier by forcing me to end our friendship because you gave me the reason to end it. It pains me to end — the loss of friendships. And that is why I appeal to you to help me in my cause so that our friendship will endure.
For as long as I can remember, the bulk of the income generated in Mindanao used to be remitted to what we, in Mindanao, refer [to] as the “Imperial Manila” to fund national projects primarily in the Metro Manila area, leaving a pittance to Mindanao as its share thereof. Mindanao was dubbed as “The Land of Promise,” and Mindanaoans say in derision that this is so because what it got from the government through the years were promises, promises and more promises.
We aim to rectify that derisive observation and, as a matter of fact, we are now in the process of fulfilling that promise through significant increases in the budget for Mindanao. At the end of my term, I hope to see the promise of Mindanao fulfilled, or at the very least, approaching fulfillment.
Be that as it may, Mindanao pauses at the crossroads of history. One road leads to harmony and peace; the other, to war and human suffering.
Despite all that has been said [for] or against the Bangsamoro Organic Law by all sectoral groups, I make this solemn commitment that this administration will never deny our Muslim brothers and sisters the basic legal tools to chart their own destiny within the Constitutional framework of our country.
When the approved version is transmitted and received by my office… The law has been passed actually and I intend to… Give me 48 hours to sign it and ratify the law. [applause] Babasahin ko pa bago ko pipirmahan. Baka may isiningit kayo diyan na hindi maganda para sa — para sa ibang tao.
We will need loads of understanding and patience to endure and overcome the birth pangs or pains of the new beginning. To me, war is not an option. We have been through the catastrophe in Marawi. We have seen the horror, the devastation, and the human toll and the displacement of both Christians and Muslims alike.
I have made a pledge that ISIS terrorists or groups or its allies will never gain foothold in our country. Yet, when what remained of the decimated Maute-ISIS group in Marawi finally saw the error of their ways and expressed their desire to be reintegrated into society, we welcomed them with open arms and embarked on genuine efforts to embrace a peaceful, productive life for them. We owe it to our fallen soldiers and police officers in Marawi and elsewhere to put an end to the bloodshed and seek the path of true peace—a peace that will last beyond this lifetime, and whose dividends our children will reap.






On international relations, we shall continue to assert and pursue an independent foreign policy. Our long-term national development and national security goals come first.
We shall continue to reach out to all nations regardless of their prevailing political persuasions or proximity to or distance from our shores so long as these nations wish us well.
Our stronger bonds with our ASEAN friends have made possible our trilateral border patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia, which has since then put out of business sea pirates, piracy and other terrorists who used to infest our shared seas. This is a testament to the readiness of our country and our good neighbors to make regional peace and security our shared responsibility.
We have successfully hosted the 50th ASEAN Anniversary and the 31st ASEAN Summit last November 2017. We have shown the world what we are capable of when we work together. The ASEAN events showcased not only the world-renowned Filipino hospitality and organizational capabilities but also our artistic talent. I would like to commend the [ASEAN National] Organizing Council led by no less than my Executive Secretary, Salvador Medialdea. [applause]
Our re-energized relations with China has also led to an unprecedented level of cooperation between our nations on the war against transnational crimes. Our shared intelligence led to the discovery and dismantling of the clandestine shabu laboratories and the arrest of Chinese chemists [connected] with the Dragon organization called Wu Syndicate.
Our improved relationship with China, however, does not mean that we will waver in our commitment to defend our interests in the West Philippine Sea.[applause] This is why we engage China through bilateral and multilateral platforms such as the ASEAN-China and the Philippines- China Bilateral Consultation Mechanism.
Opening lines of communication and amicably managing differences have led to positive developments that include renewed access of Filipino fishermen in the areas in dispute in the Philippines — West Philippine Sea.
Participation in the ASEAN-China dialogue has also resulted to the draft framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea which intends to resolve disputes by peaceful means.
We admire our Filipino migrant workers for their selflessness and courage in enduring the hardships of living away from home to provide for their families. You epitomize the innate resilience of the nation. You have shown your willingness to toil and sacrifice day-in and day-out, for the long-term good of your family and loved ones. You have also contributed greatly to the national economy, even as you help in small and big ways to the economies of our international partners.
This is why we strongly condemn the deaths and abuses experienced by Filipino migrant workers in the hands of their foreign employers. I have said this before and I say it again: I am a worker of government, and it is my vow to make sure that your well-being remains our foremost foreign policy concern. [applause]






It is for this reason that we are continuing to work with the host nations to ensure the welfare of our countrymen. I appeal to all host governments to help us, as true and dependable partners, in this endeavor.
I have always believed that no matter how well-intentioned a leader is, no matter how well- conceived may be his mission, if he lacks the political will to do what needs to be done, then he can only end up a failure and a hopeless dreamer.
As a worker of government, I promised to do whatever it would take to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, fighting powerful interests and making sacrifices. My obligation is to promote and uphold the greatest good, for the greatest number. [applause]
Our campaign against Endo has resulted in the regularization of more than 300,000 workers as of early this month. On May 1 of this year, I signed Executive Order 51, which sought to protect the workers right to security of tenure.
Read my lips, I understand that this does not satisfy all sectors. I share their sentiment; I truly do. Much as I would like to do the impossible, that power is not vested upon me by the Constitution. And neither will I make both ends meet even if I violate the laws to achieve that purpose. Simply, it is not part of my territory.
That is why I add mine to their voices in asking Congress to pass legislation ending the practice of contractualization once and for all. [applause]
Our farmers, especially our coconut farmers, form a significant part of the basic sectors of society. It is from the toil of their hands that we put food on the table. It is my hope that we finally see this through. I urge you Congress to convene the [bicameral] conference committee and pass at the soonest possible time the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund. [applause] I pray that you will do it.
My administration remains firm in its resolve to ensure that the country’s telecommunications services are reliable, inexpensive and secure. A draft Terms of Reference for the entry of a new, major industry player is at hand. The terms will be fair, reasonable and comprehensive. It will be inclusive so it will be open to all interested private parties, both foreign and local. The only condition is that the chosen entity must provide the best possible services at reasonably accessible prices.
However, our efforts to usher in a new major player shall be rendered futile if we do not improve its odds of success in an industry that has long been dominated by a well-entrenched duopoly.
We shall, therefore, lower interconnection rates between all industry players. Not only to lessen the cost to the consumers as it will also lower the costs [for the] incoming player to access existing networks, [thereby creating] a market environment that is more conducive to competition. This is a policy which is crucial to ensure that our solution to our telecommunication problems will be both meaningful and lasting.






In the last 2 years, experience has taught me that lack of consultation or insufficiency of information can, at times, lead to rash judgments. If and when I am unsure on the most appropriate course of action to take given the problem, it’s factual milieu and the desired end, I never fail to consult to discuss options with persons whom I trust and whose advice I value.
When I decided to establish Malasakit Centers in Cebu, Tacloban and Iloilo, my long-time aide, Bong Go and his team became instrumental in arriving at the right decision through proper consultations. [applause]
Deliberations with the proper agencies also made me decide to push for, and eventually approve, both the [free] Tertiary Education Act and the increase in the salary of our men in uniform, our soldiers and our policemen. [applause]
Boracay Island, widely regarded as one of our country’s treasures and admired worldwide for its natural beauty, has sadly become the representation of the government’s negligence, including mine.
I could not allow this decay to continue; decisive action has long been overdue. Recognizing that we are mere stewards of our natural resources, and I said enough is enough.
We intend to restore its environmental integrity, alongside measures to alleviate those whose livelihood were momentarily affected. Environmental protection and ensuring the health of our people cannot be overemphasized; thus, our actions in Boracay mark the beginning of a new national effort.
This is just [the beginning]. For the other tourist destinations needing urgent rehabilitation and enforcement of environmental and other laws shall soon follow. I urge our local government units to proactively enforce our laws and not wait for us to swoop down on your areas just to do your duty and work. [applause] At some other time, I would have to discuss sa local government units.
What has happened to Boracay is just an indication of the long-overdue need to rationalize, in a holistic and sustainable manner, the utilization, management, and development of our lands. I therefore urge the Senate to urgently pass the National Land Use Act [applause] to put in place a national land use policy that will address our competing land requirements for food, housing, businesses, and environmental conservation. We need to do this now.
To help safeguard the present and the future generations, we have to earnestly undertake initiatives to reduce our vulnerabilities to natural hazards, and bolster our resilience to the impact of natural disasters and climate change.
As I had stated last year, we must learn from the experiences from the Super-typhoon Yolanda, and other mega disasters, and from global best practices. We need a truly empowered department characterized by a unity of command, science-based approach and full-time focus on natural hazards and disasters, and the wherewithal to take charge of the disaster risk reduction; preparedness and response; with better recovery and faster rehabilitation.






Hence, we, in the Cabinet, have approved for immediate endorsement to Congress the passage of a law creating the “Department of Disaster Management,”[applause] an inter- agency — just like FEMA. Well, I don’t know if it’s — it’s an effective agency in the United’s government.
An inter-agency crafted and a high-priority measure aimed at genuinely strengthening our country’s capacity for [resilience] to natural disasters. I fervently appeal to Congress to pass this bill with utmost urgency. Our people’s safety requirements cannot wait.
Ours is a rich and beautiful country, indeed. Add to that a great number of people equipped with technical expertise and professionalism, and you have a country poised to soar and take its place among the world’s economic and financial eagles. God willing. Inshallah.
Nature endowed us with this wealth to be tapped for the benefit of all generations. My policy in the utilization of these resources is non-negotiable: the protection of the environment must be top priority [applause] and extracted resources must be used for the benefit of the Filipino people, [applause] not just a select few. Do not just give me taxes. I can get it from other sources. Give me what needs to be given to my countrymen. [applause]
To the mining industry, I say this once again and maybe for the last time, do not destroy the environment or compromise our resources; repair what you have mismanaged. Try to change [your] management radically because this time you will have restrictive policies. The prohibition of open pit mining is one. [applause]It is destroying my country. It is destroying the environment. It will destroy the world of tomorrow for our children. [applause]
Again, I warn irresponsible miners, along with their patrons, to stop destroying our watersheds, recharge areas, forests, and aquatic resources. You can no longer fish in our rivers. It’s all contaminated. And the color is not even brown or white, it’s black. You want to see it? I will invite you. We can go to Diwalwal and the other mining areas. And I’m sure you will puke with what is happening to this country. Expect reforms, radical ones. I do not intend to quarrel with anybody, with the moneyed, but for as long as I am here I said: you will just have to contend with me.
I expect you to do your part in ensuring our nation’s sustainable development, starting now.
I exhort all concerned agencies and local government units to uphold the concept of inter- generational responsibility in [the exploration] and utilization of our mineral wealth, the protection and preservation of our biodiversity, anchored on the right to a balanced and healthy ecology.
I applaud Congress for the timely passage of the TRAIN law. You have made funds available to build better roads and bridges, and improve health and education, and strengthen our safety and security. Some have incorrectly blamed our efforts toward a fairer tax system for all the price increases in the past months, and some irresponsibly suggesting to stop TRAIN’s implementation. We cannot and should not. We need this for sustainable growth that leaves no Filipino left behind.






TRAIN is already helping poor families and senior citizens cope up with rising prices. We have distributed unconditional cash transfers to 4 million people, and we will help 6 million more this year.
Following the one-peso discount per liter in gas stations, we have also started releasing fuel vouchers to public utility jeeps and other valid franchises. Further, we have fast-tracked the distribution of NFA rice to provide affordable rice for all. [Excuse me.]
This year, we are giving 149 billion pesos worth of subsidies to the poor and vulnerable. Next year, the amount will be increased to 169 billion pesos.
But no amount of subsidy can help the poor if some businesses take advantage of the situation to make more money. I ask businesses to cooperate with us in charging a fair price.
To help stabilize rice prices, we also need to address the issue of artificial rice shortage. I now ask all the rice hoarders, cartels and their protectors, you know that I know who you are: stop messing with the people. I hate to… Power sometimes is not a good thing. But I hope I will not have to use it against you.
Consider yourselves warned; mend your ways now or the full force of the State shall be brought to bear upon you. I am directing all intelligence agencies to unmask the perpetrators of this economic sabotage and our law enforcement agencies to bring them to justice.
We are also working on long-term solutions. On top of this agenda to lower the price of rice. We need to switch from the current quota system in importing rice to a tariff system where rice can be imported more freely. This will give us additional resources for our farmers, reduce the price of rice by up to 7 pesos per kilo, and lower inflation significantly. I ask Congress to prioritize this crucial reform, which I have certified as urgent today.
Alam mo, ako humihingi talaga ng tulong. Business is really for profit I understand that. But the Philippines has always been a playground for, you know, scoundrels and those who do it without really considering the plight of the others. It’s all conscience.
When I ran for public office, I promised to do whatever it takes to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, even if it means fighting powerful interests. I am committed to a comprehensive tax reform, and I ask Congress to continue the job.
Package 2 will lower corporate income taxes, especially for our small businesses. Lower taxes mean they will have more money to invest and create more jobs. More than 99 percent of our businesses are micro, small, or medium enterprises (MSME) and employ around 65 percent of our workers. The enactment of the Package 2 is what stands between today and millions of jobs in the near future.
Congressmen Cua, Gonzales, Abu, and Garin and Batocabe, as well as the Suansing family, filed versions of Package 2 last March 2018. Salamat po [applause] and I support their push to shepherd the bill. I hope the Senate will follow suit, maybe tomorrow, sir.






This matter is urgent. Do not be part of the problem by ignoring it. I hope to sign Package 2 before the year ends. I urge Congress to pass it in a form that satisfies our goals and serves [applause] the interests of the many, not just the wealthy few.
By the end of July 2018, all 5 packages of my tax reform would have been submitted to Congress. Apart from TRAIN, rice tariffication, and Package 2, they include the mining, alcohol, and tobacco tax increase, reform in property valuation, reform in capital income and financial taxes, and an amnesty program.
I urge Congress to take them seriously and pass them in succession, for there is no chance that we can deliver our promises without an equitable tax system.
One of the most important thrusts of this administration’s medium-term development plan is to cover all Filipinos against financial health risks. That is why I have directed concerned agencies to streamline the various sources of financial assistance for people with health-related needs.
We are currently institutionalizing the unified implementation of the “No Balance Billing Policy” [applause] through which the government and our private healthcare providers can work out a system that will provide an order of charging of medical expenses.
Much needs to be done to improve our healthcare system, which remains highly fragmented, resulting in disparity in health outcomes between the rich and the poor in the urban areas and rural. While investments in health have increased over the years, several policy and operational bottlenecks have constrained universal health care for this country.
We shall pool all our resources for health services under the [PhilHealth]; institutionalize primary care as a prerequisite to access higher level of healthcare; and supplement human resource gaps of the LGUs through a National Health Workforce Support System.
These will ensure that every Filipino [family] gets the appropriate, affordable, and quality health services in appropriate facilities and will be protected from financial burden due to sickness.
To this end, I urge the speedy passage of the Universal Health Care Bill authored by Former Representative Harry Roque. [applause] Strong political determination, not political ambition, is the guiding light. [applause]
I have no illusions of occupying this office one day longer than what the Constitution under which I was elected permits; or under whatever Constitution there might be.
Four administrations before me have tried to amend the Constitution to be able to introduce amendments and reservations to the charter — revisions rather to the charter. But none of them has successfully done for one reason or another.






I therefore consider it a distinct honor and privilege to have received earlier from the Consultative Committee that I created, the draft Federal Constitution that will truly embody the ideals and aspirations of all the Filipino people. [applause]
I thank all the members of the Committee, especially those who came out from their retirement, for their valuable services in crafting this draft Federal Constitution. I would like to extend my particular gratitude to Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno [applause] and Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.[applause]
I am confident that the Filipino people will stand behind us as we introduce this new fundamental law that will not only strengthen our democratic institutions, but will also create an environment where every Filipino—regardless of social status, religion, or ideology—will have an equal opportunity to grow and create a future that he or she can proudly bequeath to the succeeding generations.
My countrymen, I will not bore you with a litany of this administration’s projects completed otherwise in the process. That would be too self-serving. I have instead caused to be prepared a written report on what has — what was and what has been done in the months and probably in the years to come. The reports shall be made available within the next few days.
I was informed that satellite facilities were set up by the Presidential Communications Operations Office in certain far flung barangays so as of today the residents of these communities can watch the State of the Nation and for the first time see you on TV. I hope you have enjoyed the experience. [applause]
In ending, may I quote — I have always quoted but — in my previous talks. One American that I salute, the great Abraham Lincoln. And this has been — I’ve been in government for the last… If I completed my… If I complete my term, Inshallah, God willing, I would have served government for 40 years.
And I came across this statement which has been with me since I was a fiscal in the 70s. And he said: If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop, the presidency, might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is — what has been said against me won’t amount to anything. But if the end brings me out wrong, ten angels of God swearing that I was right would make no difference.
Daghang salamat ka ninyong tanan. [applause]

STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS OF 
RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 22 July 2019]
 
Thank you. Kindly sit down. Kumusta po kayo?
Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, magandang hapon po sa inyo — sa iyo, ma’am, [applause] kung nasaan ka; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito, [applause] Macapagal- Arroyo [applause]; His Excellency Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the other members of the Cabinet; Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga mahal kong kababayan.
Let me begin by extending my hand in gratitude to all who kept faith with me in our most trying times. Numbers speak a thousand words and tell a hundred tales. But the landslide victory of the Administration candidates as well as the latest survey results shows that my disapproval rating is 3%. [applause] I hope that the members of Congress — sana hindi kayo included sa 3% [laughter] — inspires me with determination to pursue relentlessly what we have started at the start of my administration.
Few men imbued with the will and the courage to do what he believes is right and just and whatever be the opposition in terms of numbers and noise, makes a majority. For it is not the eagle in the fight but the fight in the eagle that matters. [applause] Believe me, I will end my term fighting.
It has been three years since I took my oath of office, and it pains me to say that we have not learned our lesson. The illegal drug problem persists. Corruption continues and emasculates the courage we need to sustain our moral recovery initiatives.
Years ago, we saw the terrible devastation caused by illegal drugs. On May 23, 2017, our law enforcers launched an operation to serve a warrant and to neutralize terrorists. A group of armed men with sophisticated weaponry and aided by locals radicalized by extremist dogma and teachings fought our troops for weeks. During that Marawi Siege, tons of shabu worth millions and millions of pesos. Drug money killed 175 and wounded [2,101] of my soldiers and policemen in that five-month battle.






I am aware that we still have a long way to go in our fight against this social menace. Let the reason why I advocate the imposition of the death penalty for crimes related to illegal drugs. Our citizens have begun to do their part in the war against drugs, and through the barangay formation of anti-drug councils, and also actually surrendering bricks of cocaine found floating in the sea into our islands. I call this responsibility. However, the drugs will not be crushed unless we continue to eliminate corruption that allows this social monster to survive.
I respectfully request Congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes [applause] related to drugs, as well as plunder.
My countrymen, it is a sad commentary that we cannot distinguish our need from our greed, our principles from our prejudices, the real from the fake, and the truth from a lie. The reason is because that many of us, what matters above all is the “self.” It is selfishness [at] its worst for no purpose other than personal aggrandizement.
To borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have not risen above and beyond the parochial interests. Our warped loyalty to family, friends and tribal kin continue to exact a heavy toll on our programs designed to uplift the poor and reassure our investors, our foreign investors local, and the business sector in this country.
The recent uncovering of the massive fraud perpetrated against the public health insurance system proves that corruption is pervasive. Huge amounts of medical funds were released to cover padded medical claims and imaginary treatment of ghost patients. I am grossly disappointed. The government is conned of millions of pesos which could be used to treat illnesses and possibly save the lives of many. Thus I ordered the NBI to arrest and cause the prosecution of those liable. I appointed a new PhilHealth President, whom I know is a man of integrity, a military man, a former military officer, and gave him marching orders to prioritize ridding the agency of corruption.






By the way, I commend the Bureau of Investigation for its handling of high profile cases resulting in the arrest and prosecution of criminals. These culprits will have their day of reckoning in court. I hope it happens during the last three years of my term.
Concerning the unscrupulous persons manning our ports and scalawags in uniform, we have been unyielding in our reforms to weed them out of public service.
I have fired or caused the resignation of more than a hundred officials and appointees of government without regard to relationship, friendship and alliance. There is no sacred cow, as the saying goes, in my Administration.
Institutions that are the stewards of our resources and agents of development have long been a major source of public frustration. Drastic reforms within these agencies have yielded results. Our government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), infamous for high salaries and bonuses being paid their executives and employees, have started to shape up. As of July 9, 2019, we collected more than P61 billion from GOCCs or government corporations, 32% of which, or P16 billion, from PAGCOR. [applause] This is more than the P36 billion collected in 2017. My salute to Andrea Domingo. [applause] Magpasugal ka pa, ma’am, nang marami. [laughter] Bureau of Customs, though corruption-ridden, managed to collect Five Hundred Eighty Five Billion Pesos (P585,000,000,000) in 2018. Imagine how much more could have been collected had the BOC been clean and less corrupt.
May I cut and just — magsalita lang ako kung anong sa isip ko. I went to the Bureau of Customs two weeks ago and found out that there were about 63 of them facing charges, criminal charges, and 61 of them under investigation. I hope that I can have the cooperation of Congress if we cannot abolish their position. And if I cannot dismiss them for the reason that there is a security of tenure, I will just allow them to have their plantilla positions but they have to report to Congress everyday to help me in the huge paperwork that we have to do everyday. All of them will go out from the premises of the Customs area. [applause] I do not want them back.
We, in government, talk too much, act too little, and too slow. I recall saying that before the Congressional hearing when I was Mayor of Davao City. I say that again to emphasize how little we have changed since then. We are long on rhetorics but short on accomplishments. It’s either you Congress or — even the Executive department and maybe me. So I am here to rectify my own error.






That is why, I implore those who occupy positions of power and authority, to let your deeds and accomplishments do the talking. Lead by example. Words ring hollow when not followed by positive and prioritized action.
Time and again, I have emphasized that like my fellow workers in government, trabahante lang po ako ng Pilipino.
Last year, I assign — I signed the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, a significant piece of legislation to improve service delivery and fight corruption, still until now.
However, much [has] to be done in ensuring our responsiveness to the people’s needs. Based on complaints received by the Contact Center [ng] Bayan, Contact Center [ng] Bayan – — that’s in my office — the LTO, SSS, BIR, LRA, and PAG-IBIG are the top five agencies that need to drastically improve their service.
I reiterate my government — my directive to the government and instrumentalities, including the LGUs and the government corporations: simplify. May I… Nandito ba kayo? Simplify. Just like the others. You can do it electronically. You do not have to go to the office.
I’ve been asking that from you since three years ago. ‘Pag hindi pa ninyo nagawa ‘yan ngayon, papatayin ko talaga kayo. [applause] Nabubwisit na…
Simplify and make your services responsive to — client-friendly. Your client is the Filipino, our employer — from where the money in our pockets come from, from our salaries.
Thanks to Executive Secretary Medialdea, we have increased the number of lines [for] Hotline 8888 to make it more responsive to the public. Our ultimate goal is for our people to be freed from using these hotlines because government service and response have markedly improved.
Again, I will… Ang problema kasi ng Fili — I’m addressing now to the Filipino. Kayo rin kasi sinasabi ko na sa inyo, be assertive. At ‘pag kayo o ikaw hiningian more than the required payment by government at humingi pa sa iyo, I’ve been telling you mag-eskandalo kayo sa opisina. Make a scene. Sampalin mo ‘yang p***** i** na ‘yan. [laughter] Kasi aabot rin sa akin ‘yan. [applause]






And I have done that. Ako mag-prangka ako sa inyo, ako lang ang Presidente na hanggang ngayon nagbubugbog talaga ng tao diyan sa loob ng Malacañan.
Pinapakain ko ng pera ‘yang mga y*** na ‘yan. Eh galit na ako sa inyo eh. Kindly be assertive. Pagka hiningian ka, sabihin mo, “T*** *** mo. Sabi ni Duterte, the President told us, that if you extort money from me, I will slap you.”
At sampalin talaga ninyo. Hindi na bale magkaaway. I will defend you. At kung maaari and this is what I’ve been doing all along. There’s an [8888]. Be sure that it is true. Though you are not liable for libel pero huwag naman ‘yang makasakit ka ng kapwa-tao na wala namang kasalanan. [8888], then place “To President Duterte, re: abuses by the director asking for money.” Text mo, lalabas ‘yan diyan. And that is for the public to view.
At kung totoo, Malacañan, I said, is open 24 hours — 24 hours basta corruption. And that is why that fiasco about the frigate ni Trillanes was because ‘yung Koreano na napagbili ng barko, who sold the ship to the Philippine government, wala pa hong delivery. And it was there already ready.
And that is why that Korean went to Malacañan just to complain why is it that there is no request for delivery. So I told Bong, “Bong, ayusin mo ‘yan.” He went to Lorenzana and Lorenzana nagsulat siya. May nakakuha because sa Malacañan, every administration may tao ‘yan diyan. Every administration leaves some of the men because they are appointed on plantilla position.
Eh kinuha nila then it was brought here, before the Congress. And so Bong was called to testify. And he said, he was assured it will be a closed-door. I told Bong, “No, ask for an open and public hearing.”
Sabi ko, “Sabihin mo sa lahat — wala — you have nothing. Just say the truth.” Sabi ko, pagkatapos niya testify, sabi ko, “Bong, maniwala ka hindi, you will be a senator.” [applause] Totoo ‘yan. That is the story of how convoluted politics and corruption here in our country works.
Equipped with political will, the government ordered the closure of Boracay Island for six months to prevent its further deterioration. We cleaned and rehabilitated the island and I allowed it to heal naturally. I am proud to say that it has been restored close to its original pristine state. Boracay Inter- Agency Task Force led by Secretary Cimatu, and fully supported by Secretaries Año, Romulo-Puyat — Oh what’s her name? Puro surname ito,






Romulo-Puyat. What’s her name? Ah si — ah Berna. Ah, Berna Romulo-Puyat, Bello and Villar, and then TESDA Chief Mamondiong for this huge success. Kudos are also due to the PMS for integrating the six-month Rehabilitation Plan, and the NEDA for the recently-approved [Medium]-term Boracay Action Plan. [applause]
Boracay Island is just the beginning. And the girls there, the foreigners are waiting for you gentlemen to visit the place. They are all on the beach sunbathing. You are invited to — I have not been there.
Alam mo, nung naayos ‘yan, day before we were told that there’s gonna be an opening tomorrow. So on the TV on that day, Magandang Hapon, showed a lot of buntings and banners, “Salamat Duterte.” So when I saw it, I called the military and the police, “Remove the buntings. I am not going there.” No need to really arbi — ah advertise. I am paid for what I’m doing. Nakokornihan ako. Too much adulation, bordering pretentions. I can always smell it a mile away.
And I never went there until now. What I did was I went to the other side of the island and asked the DAR, “What is the status of the land behind the beach of Boracay?” And they are still categorized as forestal and agriculture. “Not…” I said, “Not commercial?” “No, sir.”
So I told the Agrarian Reform, “Go to the place, have it inspected because I will declare the whole of the island a land reform program.” And I gave the islands piece by piece to the Atis, the natives of the place para walang masabi. Marami kasi ginawa ko raw [applause] para linisan ko, ibigay ko sa mga kaibigan ko.
Wala akong kaibigang mayaman. Ayaw kong kaibigan ng mayaman because pagka mayaman ka, tatabi ka lang sa akin, pati ako napahiran na ng kung ano-ano ang hingiin mo sa gobyerno.
There are those who violate environmental rules. I am giving due notice to the LGUs and other stakeholders, kayo po, of tourist destinations to take extra steps in the enforcement of our laws and the protection of our environment.
On January 27, 2019, we officially started the Manila Bay rehabilitation. Though we have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the test results of the waters near Padre Faura. We will relocate informal settlers — I hope it can happen during my time — along the waterways and shut down establishments that continue to pollute and poison our waters.






Make a choice. I’m going to the… [Malaki ba ‘yung building diyan?] I’m going to dismantle your burning — ah building — or just simply burn it down so that we can have a new set-up of environmental friendly, whatever that means.
Through the Build, Build, Build Program in emerging economic hubs outside Metro Manila. This will swiftly gain ground, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Team led by Secretary Dominguez. Hard at work in the interconnection of our islands and cities by air, land, and sea are Secretaries Tugade and Villar.
Alam naman ninyo. Magaganda na ang airport ninyo. Inuna ko nga kayo eh. Everybody’s complaining about the Davao airport and I said, “Davao will be the last.” Kung hindi na maabutan, sabi ko mga taga-Davao, pasensya na kayo. Para walang masabi ang Congress sa atin, baka nga 3% sila doon sa kabila.
We also paved the way for the entry of third telecommunications provider. Do not worry about this. There is no corruption at all. I guarantee you, upon the grave of my father. I do not allow — I do not talk to them. I just say: Just do your work. And kung maaari, according to what the specifications are required by this government.
I challenge this new player to fulfill its commitment to provide fast and reliable telecommunication services to our people, especially in the underserved areas. DICT Secretary Honasan will be the lead man in this endeavor. I hope he is here. [applause]
However, developmental gains will not be felt by our people in the countryside if we cannot maintain law and order. ‘Yang peace and security, wala ‘yan. We need to enforce the law.
After almost two decades of peace negotiation, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was finally passed and ratified.
For decades, our Muslim brothers in the ARMM have been mired in poverty. My late Muslim brother, MinDA Chair Abdul Khayr Alonto, envisioned a progressive, peaceful, and united Mindanao during our lifetime. It is my hope that the Bangsamoro Transition will fast-track the establishment of regional government that will secure and comfortable life for Muslim brothers and sisters, and all indigenous communities in the Bangsamoro Regions.






Additionally, I have taken the helm of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict and have assigned a Cabinet member to each region to harmonize government efforts in attaining national development [and] security.
Through the exceptional leadership of Secretary Briones and the DepEd, I am proud to say that this year more Filipino learners are receiving basic education, with over 27 million enrollees from Kinder to Senior High School. [applause]
And because we have still a little to spare, the fastest population growth, one of the — is the Philippines. We are so industrious that we are producing more people than… [laughter] I do not want to quarrel with the religious but…
More than [823,000] — sorry my eyes is not good — for the… Isinusuot ko lang ‘to ‘pag mag — paminsan-minsan eh. Out-of-school youth and adult learners were able to access non-formal education through the Alternative Learning System. For our national sports development, I support the proposed measure to create the National Academy of Sports for High School students. [applause]
Almost 86,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises or the MSMEs have received over P3 billion worth of loans since 2017, thanks to the efforts of Secretary Lopez and the DTI.
Additional benefits for solo parents, [applause] the assignment of health workers in all barangays, and the expansion of the Malasakit Centers, are what we also hope to achieve through the bills filed by the original concept of Bong Go. [applause] Para manalo sa kampanya, ‘yon ang mantra niya. Totohanin mo lang, Bong, mapahiya tayong lahat. [laughter]
I also implore Congress… You — look. You have to study this very carefully. Congress has to postpone the May 2020 elections and ‘yung Barangay, Sangguniang Kabataan to October 2022. Because if you read it, this… [applause] To rectify the truncated terms. Paiba-iba na eh. The truncated terms of sitting barangays but also provide them with the ample time to finish their programs and projects. I suggest Congress should also enact the Magna Carta for Barangays. [applause]






This Administration’s malasakit at serbisyo program has, of course, reached the Filipinos who labor in foreign lands. The milestone signing of the Bilateral Labor Agreement with Kuwait in 2018 is a testament of my commitment to stop abuses inflicted on our overseas Filipinos. To ensure their welfare, protection and their access to government services, the establishment of the Department of Overseas Filipinos will sufficiently address this particular need. [applause]
Our accomplishments for the past three years and the plans for the next three are discussed in detail in my mid-term report to the people, copies of which shall be made available before the day ends.
Let me repeat what I said many times before. Honestly, I have identified the enemy who dumped us into this quagmire we are in. I have met the enemy face-to-face and sadly, the enemy is “us.” We are our own tormentors — addressing the Filipino people — we are our own demons; we are as rapacious predators preying on the helpless, the weak and the voiceless. We find corruption everywhere in government with every malefactor watching his cohort’s back in blatant disregard of his oath when he assumed public office. Even the language has evolved to soften the wickedness of the criminal act. “For the Boys”, “sponsoring an event” or what-else-have-you. No amount of euphemism can trivialize or normalize betrayal of public trust or any other criminal offense. It is an injury laced with insult. It is both a national embarrassment and a national shame.
For every transaction, a commission; for every action, extortion; and a request that goes on and on – endlessly and shamelessly.
Catharsis is what we, individually and collectively, need to do today – not tomorrow but today. Self-purgation followed by the resolve to do what is right and proper, is good for the nation’s health.
Let me ask you: When will corruption end? Kailan ba talaga ‘to? Hanggang kailan? Well, I don’t know. I’ve been in — with government for almost 35 years now. I am not singling out myself. It’s the entire gamut of our system.
Corruption exasperates. It frustrates. It is also exasperating that there are times when I think that perhaps it is blood that we need to cleanse and rinse away the dirt and the muck that stick to the flesh like leeches.
Of course, it is only a thought. I am simply thinking aloud. To dispel any controversy that my statements in this regard will create something else. Words of Pedro Guerrero who said, “Sometimes they write what I say and they write — and they write what I say and not what I mean.” So ‘yung mga pa-purga-purga lang diyan. I use similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and other figures of speech every now and then, to prove or stress a point. I am as human as anybody else.






On the matter of the Philippine — West Philippine Sea. The avoidance of conflict — armed conflict and protection of our territorial waters and natural resources compel us to perform a delicate balancing act. A shooting war is grief and misery multiplier. War leaves widows and orphans in its wake. I am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction, more widows and more orphans, should war, even on a limited scale, breaks out. More and better results can be reached in the privacy of a conference room than in a squabble in public. That is why I will do in the peaceful way, mindful of the fact that it is our national pride and territorial integrity that are at stake.
Short of expressly advocating a call to arms, there are those who say that we should stand up and stop those who fish in our economic zone. Of course we will do in due time. There is…
Alam mo ganito ‘yan eh. Noong — when I became President and when the M16 rifles were cancelled by America upon the prodding of the US Congress, I found myself in a quandary because reports were already very ripe na there was the passing of arms in Marawi.
And because of the arms were already — mostly in the hands of the police, hands-me-down from the army were quite old and sometimes the bolt that pushes the bullet flies out and the barrel has really become lose, and there are no more launch and planes to push it into a circular trajectory to maintain its accuracy.
So I was forced to go to China. Eh mabuti’t na lang nasabi ko sa inyo ‘to. Then in China, we had a bilateral. I brought along the military man — Año, the chief of staff then, and all of them, Lorenzana, Esperon, National Security.
In that meeting, I said — Cabinet members were there — “I want to go to my territory to dig oil.” That was the word, “I dig.” Because that is ours. Ang sabi ni President Xi, “Well, you know there is a conflict there. Do you think, rather than go there and have a confrontation — not necessarily the grey ships, war ships. But you know a squabble there could lead to something else.” Sabi niya, we just became friends. And perhaps we can talk about this. But not an outright precipitate move because… He said it softly, “It can mean trouble.”






If the trouble comes out from the mouth of a president of a republic, anong magawa ko? So what did I answer? “Well then maybe, sir, we can talk about this at some other time.” But definitely, before I go, we must talk about the West Philippine Sea. We cannot you know, have our cake and eat it too.
You know, I cannot go there even to bring the Coast Guard to drive them away. China also claims the property and he is in possession. ‘Yan ang problema. Sila ‘yung in possession and claiming all the resources there as an owner. We are claiming the same but we are not in the position because of that fiasco noong dalawang nag-standoff doon during the time of my predecessor si Albert, ambassador. If I’m correct. I do not know his real name. Tayo ang umatras. Pagsabi niya umatras, that was a kind of a compromise. Tayo ang umatras. Noong umatras tayo, pumasok sila. Marami na.
That day, we lost the Spratly and the Panganiban Island. Iyan ang totoo. Walang bolahan ‘yan. Ngayon, may arbitral ruling. I… I said, I could not even ask for the oil claiming the entire resources of the…
Anong sabihin ko sa kanila? Kaya sinabi ko, “Let us do this mutually.” Of course, when Xi says, “I will fish,” who can prevent him? And sabi ko naman, “We will fish because we claim it.”
And sabi ko, “Please allow because…” Before that, they were driving away our fishermen. ‘Di ba inaabog nila? Kaya sabi ko, “Do not drive them away because the Filipinos are of the belief that they are also — they claim it.”
Now, if you deprive — deprive the Filipinos of — there, magkagulo talaga ‘yan. And it could lead to ano — not really war, and I said, “we have to…”
Kaya ang sabi ko… When I said, “I allowed,” that was on the premise that I own the property. Pero hindi tayo in control of the property. Ayan magsabi sila, “Of course, I will allow you.” Kaya pinabalik.
Eh ‘yung disgrasya, ‘yung pagsabi “a mere incident — legal, marine incident,” ‘yan ang ginagamit sa batas ‘yan, “a marine incident happened.” Hindi naman sinasabi na “marine accident.”






It was just nabanggan, wala naman. So they wanted to talk, tapos ayaw dito. And so, “So sige, we will investigate and you investigate, and when you are ready, we should meet and compare notes, and let us determine who pays for what damage.”
Ganun lang. Ipadala ko ‘yung marines ko to drive away the Chinese fishermen. I guarantee you, not one of them will come home alive.
Kung ipadala ko ‘yung limang — pati ‘yung frigate ko na bago, ‘yung pinagkaguluhan nila ni Trillanes diyan sa — that made Bong a Senator, ubos ‘yan because there are already guided missiles in that island.
And the fastest that they have installed there can reach Manila in seven minutes. You want war? Alam mo, asaran ‘yan eh. Supladuhan ‘yan. Kung supladuhan lang, murahin, “P***** i** mo, l**** ka. Umalis ka diyan.”
Kung ganunan lang, bright ako diyan. Hanggang bunganga lang. Pero kung bunutan na ng baril, ah pwede siguro basta dalawa lang. But the problem is, there — whether we do it in a diplomatic way, there will be heated arguments, sigurado ‘yan.
We do it in a confrontation doon. We try to drive them away, it could lead to a violence. Any way ‘yan. By the way the President answered when I said “I will dig my oil” the first time I went to China.
Nakita ko ‘yung tao eh. So you can, more or less, draw a profile of his, “Please do not do that because there will be trouble.” Ano… Anong magagawa ko?
I go there, I said, “The fisheries who were…” And besides, I was invoking ‘yung traditional fishing rights. It is in that arbitral ruling. Ayaw lang ninyong gustong tignan.
It is mentioned there that even before countries were in existence, people around an ocean or a lake had already been fishing there for generations. And that is why fishing rights are allowed in the so many cases between Finland and Germany, decided by UNCLOS — UNCLOS and the International Law of the Seas.
UNCLOS is a product of a treaty. That treaty is also a part of our land because we are a signatory. Eh kung basahin lang ninyo ‘yan nang husto, it is there. You might just…






China and everybody recognizes traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments. That law is a humane law.
So I’m sorry I have to… I promised you 40 minutes. My God, I… You want me to stop? We can go home now. [laughter] I have exceeded my… There is the, you know, there is a time for everything.
Do not believe the others because they are not my friends. They are my political enemies. They said I do not believe in God. Who says? I am a believer of a universal mind there.
But [applause] I do not believe that a God so perfect would create hell for his creation. What kind of God is he? He is not my God. There is a time to — for everything. A time to negotiate and a time to quarrel with your enemy, with your political opponents or with your wife.
That is why some lives here are… And a time to antagonize and a time to make peace and a time to go to war, and a time to live and a time to die. That’s Ecclesiastes 3.
Our ownership of the Philippine — West Philippine Sea is internationally recognized. However, both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arbitral Award in the case of People — “Republic of the Philippines vs. People’s Republic of China” recognize instances where another state may utilize the resources found within the coastal state’s Exclusive Economic Zone.
The arbitral ruling even states, the one that they are charging me for violating the Constitution…. Sino gani ‘yon? Suntukin lang kita diyan ngayon mabuti pa. Nandito eh. The arbitral ruling even states that the Philippines may enter into fishing agreements with other states, provided certain conditions and requisites in the UNCLOS are met.
So ‘yung akin, sabi niya, “Let’s go fish.” Sabi ko, “You have to act…” You know, they have been there fishing since time immemorial. I think it was Adam who got the first Lapu-Lapu there.
Let me assure you, that national honor and territorial integrity shall not — shall be foremost in our mind, and when we may take the next steps in this






smoldering controversy over the lines of arbitral ruling, the West Philippine Sea is ours.




There is no ifs and buts. It is ours. But we have been acting, [applause] along that legal truth and line. But we have to temper it with the times and the realities that we face today.
Poverty incidence fell from 27.6 percent in the first half of 2015 to 21 percent in the first half of 2018. The most important number, though, is the six million Filipinos we need to pull out from poverty. Kindly help me on this.[applause]
And you know, as I said, corruption is everywhere. You are free to investigate. I don’t take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime.
You do not have to call me. Call the idiots, expose them, and send them to jail. You are helping me. Do not be… I am not… I’ve been a prosecutor. I know how it works. Feel free. Feel free to expose anything that is not in accordance with law.
We have pursued tax reforms to fund our poverty reduction programs. I therefore implore Congress to immediately pass Package 2 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, or the TRABAHO Bill, which shall gradually lower the income — corporate income tax, and rationalize and improve fiscal incentives.
It will energize our MSMEs and encourage them to expand their business and hopefully generate, hopefully — I’m missing the word hopefully para sabihin na “you’re all talk” — hopefully [1.4] million jobs in the coming years. The MSMC — MSMEs hold the promise of raising a lot of the Filipinos.
I therefore believe that it is now time for Congress to approve a new version of the Salary Standardization Law. Ngayon na. [applause] And to the teachers, alam mo dito who toil and work tirelessly to educate our young.
Kasali na po dito ‘yung hinihingi ninyo. Hindi naman masyadong malaki, pero it will tide you over during these hard times. A little bit bigger than before. [applause] This is intended to increase the salaries of national government workers, including teachers and nurses. Nurses, correct. [applause]






I am also asking Congress to pass the remaining packages of my Administration’s Tax Reform Program, and the bills that would further raise excise taxes on — very good, let us do it — tobacco and alcohol.
Sinong naninigarilyo dito? They should be exterminated from the face of the earth. [laughter] They are the ones… You know, I… I’m… I do not hide my-
— what’s wrong with me. I acquired Buerger’s disease because I smoke.
But I made it a national policy because you know when I was new mayor, I went around to see the discos and night clubs. I could hardly see the faces of the people inside. You have to wade into a thick smoke to just recognizeone.
So that’s when I decided. But I was still smoking. But I decided because I knew, I already had it. So it’s time to — sabi ko. And a national law, para lahat na, that at 12 o’ clock, everything closes.
I am not trying to pull a chair here. Mine was that two o’clock noon sa Davao, it was two then I reduced it to one. When that boxing mayor there became mayor, she reduced it to six. Walang order, no orders in advance.
Kasi we have ordered already, so you can close but we have to drink. Itong ngayon, at 12, everything closes down. Nobody works. So I… I think that we should adopt it. Most of the states, in many states, in many countries, ganun man. Alas dose, sarado na talaga.
We have to stop drinking. And jukebox, they’re only good up to eight, nine. Eight, maganda ‘yan. It’s a… It’s there in every corner, store. Blares out noise and the children who will go to school and the working class, and you are there with your store.
I have prohibited it in Davao. And at 12, as you see, Davao is quiet because everybody is resting already. Be it in the memorial parks, cemetery, or inthe comfort of their homes.
The valuation system has also to be improved local government units and rationalize capital income [taxation]. I urge Congress to review and pass the Government Rightsizing Bill to reconfigure the existing Metro Manila-centric bureaucracy; streamline government systems in order to deliver services without delay and within a short timeline.






These reforms would be for naught if we cannot avert of a “new poor” every time a disaster strikes. The Philippine experience has shown that natural disasters and — are poverty creators.
That is why, we need to hasten the establishment of a Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) so that these department focus on the natural hazards and climate change. I urge Congress to fast-track the passage of the Administration of this bill — Administration version rather. In 2017, I reminded all of you of the probable consequence of a catastrophic earthquake in Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces. Since then, I have established the Project Management Office for the Earthquake Resilience and the Greater Manila Area to implement two-pronged strategy on earthquake resilience and mitigation efforts.
I just heard, it’s not in my speech. I just heard that from a psychic that the first crack when the “Big One” hits, will be right here in the center of
this… [laughter and applause]
‘Yan man ang sabi nila. “Philippines is so corrupt, it’s so lousy that if you kill all congressmen, senators and the president, we will have a new
day.” [laughter] So I pray that if the earthquake comes, it comes now. This moment. [laughter] Kumpleto na tayo. May madamay pa tayo doon sa harap. [laughter]
We weathered one damaging effect of climate change this year. The El Niño were wreaked havoc in the agricultural sector and caused water shortage in the greater Metro Manila area. We need to pass bill creating the Department of Water Resources and Water Regulatory Commission. [applause]
Alam mo, the agencies and the guys there handling the — the entire water works system — you have to change it immediately.
You know what, there was this three-day no water. I was in Davao. So everybody was complaining and I was even afraid to come here because what if my girlfriend will not be able to – — to take a bath. [laughter] She will smell like hell. So I said, I’ll wait for the water to wash her.
Alam mo kung hindi ako nagmura, kung hindi ko sinabi, “p**** i**, papatayin ko kayo, p**** i** niyo.” And then when I arrived in the morning, there was water. And my girlfriend was fresh. [laughter]
I also call on Congress to pass a law mandating a Fire Protection Modernization Program. Diyan tayo nagka-ano. If you go to Davao, you’ll






find the best. The best of everything, 911, all the cameras, all the screens. We did that if you can find it.
Alam mo — alam mo sabi ni… Is there… Sonny is here? Secretary Dominguez? Ah Sonny. Siya man ang magyayabang. Sabi niya, “marami tayong pera”. Pero ‘pag tanungin namin siya doon sa Cabinet meeting, “tsk tsk tsk tsk, walang pera, walang pera”. [laughter] Si Diokno ganun rin kaya gi-tapon ko sa Central Bank. [laughter]
Every time sabihin mo, you know we discussed projects, we plan and we submit it to Congress, it’s final imprimatur. Eh ‘di kami ang, “May pera ba tayo diyan, sir? “Wala.” “Magkano?” “Four billion.” “Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk that is not the tsk tsk practice. No money, no money.” P***. Saan pala ang pera natin dito? Sa bulsa ninyo? [laughter] Karaming collection natin dito. But Sonny says that we can fund. This one we have to answer.
Now, I would like to remind… Pagbigyan na lang ninyo ako tutal para naman ito sa lahat. Alas- sais pa nga ginugutom na kayo. Hindi pala kayo nag- merienda?
Alam mo, ever since na-integrate ‘yan you would notice in your cities and provinces the deterioration of the service itself. Wala ng mga truck, luma na. And would you believe it in Davao City, I’ll show it to you, we have a
1934 Studebaker fire truck. Maganda pa.
So we have to — we have to do better than this. There are other cities which are utterly — – utterly without the tools to respond the challenges of fire. We have to come up with something that is really good.
I mean at this age, it would be a shame if you cannot put up a fire in two days, three days, my God. We have to set aside.
Sonny, you have the money? [laughter] Oh yes. Oh see. Basta sa maraming tao mahiya man mag-deny. [laughter] Totoo ‘yan. Totoo ‘yan. We have the money so maybe Sonny can give you a figure that we can set aside.
Nakakahiya talaga itong ano natin. Ang Davao, meron. Davao has a very good 911. Hindi ako nagyayabang. And we have cameras in every corners that’s why we can solve crimes immediately. And meron kaming 911. “What is your emergency?” That’s the standard. So it’s fire, they call the fire department.






Sabi ko, “911.” “Yes.” “What’s your emergency?” “I — I seemed to lost my –
— to have lost my girlfriend.” “We know you, Mayor. You go back to Manila there are plenty left there. Go.” [laughter]
This will equip the fire — Bureau of Fire Protection with tools to respond to the challenges. I further ask Congress to urgently pass the Na — ito — the National Land Use Act or NALUA within this year. [applause] Paki lang po. So that we can proceed with the new… Well, we can meet the — the demands of the new investors coming in. Ang lupa natin ang problema eh.
A science-based national land use plan would serve as basis for the LGUs in crafting respective development plans, and help disperse economic activities to the countryside.
The dispersion of economic and business activities to Visayas and Mindanao is not just a campaign promise. It is an economic imperative and a key to our country’s sustainable and equitable development. We will encourage investments that would develop the rural areas and Metro Manila and other mega urban areas.
Let me cut here, tutal maliit na lang. I would just like to remind everybody. No offense intended to the mayors and governors to the local government. Pero ‘yang style ninyo na it takes about three days, four days for the employees of a certain company, store, or whatever to go back and forth, back and forth.
When they go back, you have a new regulation. He gets it, he secures it and when he goes back, oh there’s still you have to follow — you have to get this paper.
I will tell you now. Hindi ako nagyayabang. In Davao, it’s one hour unless there is a need for ocular inspection. I am directing you publicly mayors — mayors. I am directing also the DILG, Secretary Año of the local government to see to it that this is honored. All clearances, permits emanating from your office that would need also your approval, must be out at the very least within three days. [applause]
You do not do that. I am directing si Secretary Año, is he here, sir? Nandito ka? Oh Secretary Año, he is the former chief of staff, he’s also a military man.






I want three days, unless there is an exceptional reason, three days, para hindi na magpa- balik-balik kasi diyan ang perahan eh. Pagdating doon meron na naman hingin, pagdating doon may hingin.
Kaya I said the Filipinos if it is done to you, I’m telling you, slap the guy, create a scene, create a scandal because that incident however little will reach me. And if it does, you can be sure, if I do not call you and the idiot, I will go there myself. That is a promise, that is a pledge. [applause]
Make it a part of my oath of office. Lahat kayo diyan pati ‘yang tsk — easement. Well, under Villar, okay na. Pero ‘yang easement billion dollar — ah billion pesos. Well, if it’s a foreign company, it’s a billion dollar thing.
Ganun ‘yan. Pabalik-balik at hindi binabayaran. That’s why nagpatong… If all moneys and revenues due government are collected in good faith, marami tayong pera. I’m telling you as President. Marami tayong pera para extra money to uplift the — the mass of Filipinos who are suffering. Maski ospital lang and housing.
Jobs, it’s the economy that runs it. If the economy is good, more jobs. At the meantime, itong hospitalization, education, the basic things at saka itong relocation. Kaawa talaga.
Kung makolekta lang lahat hindi ma-corrupt ang pera, marami tayong pera. Kaya ako nagsabi. That’s why I — I resi…
You know, I will make it public. I was at the Nayong Pilipino. I gave it to a group of people. Tapos nagpa-bidding sila. Ang nagbidding nila is to allow a gambling casino to be erected there inside the Nayong Pilipino.
Kaya ko nagsabi t*** i** ninyo. Anong kahulugan ng Nayong Pilino kung lagyan mo ng sugalan and without a bidding? You know, nandiyan na ‘yung mga generals, they are there, chief of staff. Kasi pag galing doon pumunta ako sa command conference. Pagdating ko sa command conference, may ipinasa si Sonny ghost delivery sa AFP hospital. Eh galing pa ako doon sa…
When I was facing the military and police, sabi ko, “Look, I thought I had my back covered by you? If I cannot trust you, you better tell me now. Because if you the commanders of the Air Force, Army pati Albayalde and the Navy, I






will step down now. I am resigning, I’ll go back to Davao. You do the explaining to the people why.”
Ginanun ko talaga. And in one of the Cabinet meetings ganun rin. There was this two-year, pabalik-balik na ‘yung — back and forth, back and forth, for two years it was sitting on their ass, the papers.
So when they were explaining to me the revised plan and with so many requirements, clearances from NBI, I stood up with the Cabinet members, lahat kami. In a Cabinet meeting I said, “Stop. That idiotic matrix is not for me. That is intended for the next — maybe the president after the next.” Lumabas ako sabi ko, “Inyo na ‘yang gobyerno ninyo.”
Sabi ko wala ako… I — I’m tired. I’m tired and I am… Talagang gusto ko na rin mag-resign. Sabi ko I am not happy anymore. Sabi ko anytime — ah the military said, if you want to go out? If you want to take over coup d’etat, go ahead. Do not bring your armors. Do not bring your weapons here. Just call me and we’ll have coffee.
I do not believe. I think Marcos and Estrada were correct that they did not allow the… Kasi ‘yung guwardiya mo, guwardiya dito, pareho ‘yan. Lahat sila dadaan ‘yan sa presidential command. All of them will be assigned. Nag- iikot ‘yan sila lahat. A taste of everything. Hanggang Mindanao kaya kilala ko ‘yan sila lahat dumaan ng Mindanao eh.
Sabi ko talaga, “Inyo na. Ayaw ko na.” Sabi ko, “Sige, sinong gusto? Raise your right hands. I…” “I…” “Duly appointed member of the junta, will now make the SONA next month.”
Ah bahala kayo diyan. You threatened about… If you think that you can run the country better than the elected one, go ahead. That’s not my — it’s the problem of the Filipino people.
Talaga sa Cabinet na — na tsk… Kaya abutan ako ng topak, magbaba dito ako ngayon. Bahala na kayo diyan. I’m going home.






One ese — one estimate pegs economic losses at P3.5 billion a day due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila. So meantime, I reiterate my directive, my request, my pleadings to the MMDA and all concerned local officials in Metro Manila, and all other cities, to undertake immediate action to ensure the speedy and smooth flow of vehicular traffic. Reclaim all public roads that are being used for private ends. Marami diyan. [applause]
And again, I asked Secretary Año to see to it that this is enforced. If there is a mayor or a governor, or kung ano kang — sino kang demonyo ka, i- suspend mo Sir Año. Give him time and if he cannot — if he is not up to it, then pagpahingain mo na lang. Suspend mo na. Wala talagang — wala tayong magawa.
They just keep on pleasing their own constituents just because they are constituents — a leader. Ganun kayo eh. The only way to do it… Anyway, me, I have no problem. Me, I am an inutil official. Me, I cannot run anymore. Me, after six years I might lose my head. Wala na ako. I… No more challenges in politics. No more mountains to climb. I will just do my duty.
And most of my Cabinet members are actually military men. You know why? Gusto ninyong malaman? Do not be embarrassed. Atin-atin na lang ito.
Huwag mo na silang pansinin, ‘yang mga ano diyan. Parang nag meeting- meeting lang tayo dito. [laughter] ‘Yung parang nagpulung-pulong lang. Do not mind them. Eh kung tignan kasi ninyo mahiya kayo.
Kasi ganito ‘yan, my penchant for military men. I want to ingratiate myself to them? What? I was elected by the people, not by the military, not by the police. But to — why do I have this I said — this predisposed of… Kasi utusan sila madali. Kasi ‘pag sinabi mong walang corruption, walang corruption. Kaya lang ang military and just like any organization, ‘pag ang top diyan general o ang commander-in-chief corrupt, ku-corrupt ‘yan lahat.
Pero kung sabihin mo na matino ka, they will follow. So Boracay I
sent Cimatu. Sabi ko, “Puntahan mo nga doon.” Is General Cimatu here, si Roy? Ah yeah.
Itong si Roy nakilala ko ito sa Mindanao. Hindi ko man ‘yan kilala. Mindanao… Na-mayor kasi ako 23 years. So all of them passed by Mindanao, kilala ko. ‘Pag inutusan mo, kaagad. And they know that I will not






give illegal orders for them to implement. Alam nila abugado ako. Sabi ko sundin lang ako ninyo.
Kaya I was surprised when I ordered Cimatu to go there — to Boracay, Sir Frank. Alam mo ang ginawa niya? The next day lumabas siya roon sa Daily Mirror. Naglalakad siya doon sa beach, naka-t-shirt ng blue at ‘yung mata niya nandoon sa dalawang Caucasian na nag… [laughter]
“G****** it, Cimatu. Akala ko ba inutusan kita?” “Yes, sir.” “O bakit ka nagpalakad-lakad diyan sa beach tinitignan mo ‘yung naka-bikini na dalawang puti?” “Sir, napadaan lang ako sir.” Sabi ko, “Trabahuin mo ‘yan ha.” And they did it in six months’ time. Of course with a… [applause] I like Cimatu because he mixed his pleasure with
work. [laughter] That is the way how to do it. [laughter]
I give you until the last week of the year ‘yung sa — September na to do this. Clean the
LGUs. Walang mangyari dito.
We shall continue to invest in the countryside through agricultural programs that will increase the productivity and income of our small farmers and fisherfolk. We shall ensure the full implementation of the Rice Tariffication Law, including the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund. This will safeguard the livelihood of small farmers through the provisions of modern farm equipment and machineries, seeds and credit, and extension services.
I also have not forgotten my commitment to uplift the lives — ito — coconut farmers and further develop the coconut industry until the urgent —
– ah through the urgent utilization of the Coconut Levy Fund. That is 100 million. [applause] Kaya ako very careful until now wala akong nakuha. Look, it is really hard to look for an
honest man. I must admit it. Baka ako hindi ko rin kaya. I do not have that well…
Itong coco fund na ito, ito ‘yung naiwan sa — noong kay Marcos na levy fund. This is sacred money. This money was taken out of the pockets of the Filipinos arbitrarily. Wala kang magawa noon eh martial law. Ito na ‘yan.
Kaya itong coco levy fund, kung sabihin mo lang, tama ang Supreme Court. Hindi mo pwedeng maibigay — sabi mo sino. You can no longer trace the truthful owner of the land.






Ang plano ko, kung gusto ninyo, you save the money. You invest the money. Siguro mag-abot ‘yan ng mga more than 100 billion. Ilagay na lang ninyo ng ano trust fund for the government. It’s about mga 5 billion. Ayon na lang ang gastusin ninyo to reserve the money. Rather than do it parang sprinkle na ibigay mo sa mga tao. You cannot — sabi ng Supreme Court tama sila —
– you can no longer trace the genealogy of the owners — the original owners. And
sometimes it would fail.
I will not act on that until I find the money. Wala pa akong nakuha. I have yet — I have yet to look for the money. Hanggang ngayon naghahanap ako. Wala akong makita. Kasi malaki ito and this will — this will, you know, if you assign a corrupt idiot there. Kaya gusto — ang gusto ko o baka nagustuhan rin ninyo, i-deposito ko na lang. Let it remain as a remembrance to the people who lost their ah — at that time. Tapos ‘yung 5 billion, ‘yon ‘yung to improve the econo — the improvement sa replanting sa coconut.
Five billion, that’s a big money. Pero kung ibigay mo, let it sprinkler, walang mangyayari. ‘Yung taga-bigay kukuha ‘yan — ‘yung pupunta. That’s why itong Land Bank na ito, ‘pag hindi ito na… You know, you are called Land Bank but you are now the number one commercial bank in the Philippines.
What the heck is happening to you? You are supposed to finance agricultural enterprises and endeavors. Bakit wala? [applause] Bakit — why can’t you just buy a few wagons or whatever? Go to the countryside and ask the people if there are cooperatives, tulungan ninyo to form one. [applause]
‘Pag wala, eh tignan ninyo na maibigay ninyo for replanting of the coconut —
– to revive the coconut industry. Pahiramin ninyo ng pera plus the money — ‘nung sabi ko of the coconut levy. That is sacred money. Land Bank should go back to land. Why are you mired in so many commercial transactions?
Bumalik kayo where you were created for and that is to help the farmers. Ilang administration na wala? [applause] You better decide on that, I will give you until the end of July to give me a plan or else I will ask Congress to reconfigure you what-not. Wala eh, wala kayong… [applause]
I’m asking now Congress, ‘pag wala sila — if there is no viable plan for that for the farmers and it is just all commercial transactions, might as well abolish it and give the money to the congressmen for their development






funds. [laughter] O mas makatulong pa. Diretso eh. Ayaw
ninyo? [laughter] O ayaw daw nila, Sir Frank. Huwag mo na lang galawin.
I once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a more responsive version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund to ensure the accelerated utilization of coco levy funds for the well-being and empowerment of the coconut farmers. [applause]
We recognize the urgent need to ensure the sustainability and availability of resources and the development of alternative ones. In this regard, I trust that Secretary Cusi shall fast-track also the development of renewable energy sources, and reduce dependence on the traditional energy sources such as coal.
Finally, sustaining our gains entails a national security posture capable of defending the country from external and internal security threats. Defense Secretary Lorenzana, together with the gallant men and women of the armed forces, is at the forefront of this fight.
We expect support for legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening defense- related systems such as the proposed National Defense Act, the Unified Military and Uniformed Personnel Separation, Retirement, and Pension Bill, and the revival of the mandatory ROTC in Grades 11 and 12. [applause]
Very important. Alam mo ‘pag mag giyera-giyera, 10 out of 10 hindi marunong maghawak ng baril to defend even his father and mother and brothers and sisters. Itong mga bata ngayon, they are bereft of the patriotism and the love of country. Balik sila dito.
I think a military training would be good for everybody. Kung hindi sige lang
— sa shabu, mamaya namatay, krrrkkk. “Duterte: Extrajudicial killing. Report to the ICC.” Ah okay. If you can provide me with a good comfortable cell, heated during winter time, I want to go — and an air-conditioned during hot weather. And a conjugal visits, unlimited, [laughter] para we can understand each other.






We are aware of the fact that there are times in AFP and PNP personnel, while in the performance of their duties, get unjustly sued. Providing them with free legal assistance to help and boost their morale.
My fellow citizens, to borrow the words of Churchill — akin ‘to, this is mine: We are now entering a period of consequences. The consequences of what we did and did not do but should have done during my first half of my term. I assume full responsibility for that. As President, I cannot pass it — the blame to anybody. So it’s on me.
Though we cannot change the past, we will not squander the future. I will push harder in the pursuit of programs that we have started, but always within the parameters of the law. I will not merely coast along or while away my time during the remaining years of my administration. It ain’t my style. [applause] But I will not stop until I reach the finish line. Then and only then shall I call it a day. [applause]
Our goal for the next three years is clear: a comfortable life for everybody, all Filipinos. We have made significant strides and accomplished signal milestones as a nation in the past three years. This momentum must continue with greater fervor in the next three years and beyond.
I dream of glowing days ahead for every Filipino. I dream of a Philippines better than the one I grew up with.
This is my pledge and commitment for just three years, if I can. If I cannot, I’m sorry. But I shall continue to comply with my constitutional duty to serve and protect the Filipino, until the last day of my term.
God Bless the Filipino. God Bless the Philippines. Thank you very much! [applause]

5TH STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS OF
RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 27 July 2020]
Kindly…
Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and the justices of the Supreme Court; His Excellency Munther Mafoodh Salim Al-Mantheri and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; mga mahal kong kababayan.
We live in a troubled time. Our dream of prosperity for our country was suddenly snuffed by a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease.
But let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives will itself be laid to rest.
In the meantime, let us express the nation‘s gratitude to those who courageously and willingly put their lives on the line to serve the people and country. We share the griefs of their families and no amount of tears can compensate their great losses.
My countrymen, it is sad that while government focuses its attention and resources to battle the coronavirus, there are those who take advantage of a pre-occupied government.
One of them is Senator Frank Drilon. In an interview, he arrogantly mentioned among others that oligarchs need not be rich. Then he linked the anti-dynasty system with oligarchy and the topic was my daughter and son. This happened after the Committee on Franchise voted 70-11 to deny the






grant of franchise to ABS-CBN. Obviously, he was defending the Lopezes that they are not oligarchs.
Great wealth enables economic elites and corporations to influence public policy to their advantage. Media is a powerful tool in the hands of oligarchs like the Lopezes who used their media outlets in their battles with political figures. I am a casualty of the Lopezes during the 2016 election.
The dealers and purveyors of illegal drugs, hiding in the shadow of COVID- 19, have stepped up their activities. The amount of shabu valued at millions of pesos seized during police operations speak volumes of the enormity and weight of the problem that we bear.
The corrupt, the grafters and the influence peddlers also take advantage of the fear and confusion that the coronavirus generates. The financial and material assistance of the government to the unemployed, the sick and the destitute running into billions of pesos, are not spared from corruption and ineptitude. Even the donations from well-meaning private persons are skimmed before reaching their intended beneficiaries. It is like snatching food from the mouths of babes.
The profiteers, over-pricers and corrupt felons must be laughing while they stash their dirty monies. But not for long. They cannot outrun the long arm of the law.
In this regard, the words of former President Ramon Magsaysay ring fresh and relevant today as on the day they were said decades ago. He said:
―We need men of integrity and faith like Rizal and del Pilar, men of action like Bonifacio, men of inflexible patriotism like Mabini. We need their zeal, their self-reliance, their capacity for work, their devotion to service, their ability to lose themselves in the common cause of building a nation.‖
If we allow greed, self-interest and ambition to rule us, then as stated by one prominent physician, we will ―be left with nothing better than the lesser evil instead of the greater good.‖
In my inaugural address four years ago, I said that no leader can succeed at anything of national importance [or] significance unless he has the cooperation and support of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve.






The efforts and resources which we poured out produced the momentum needed to bring our country closer to our goals. Suffice it to state, we made significant strides over time.
Over 4.3 million poor families benefitted from the Pantawid Pamilya; over 9.2 million beneficiaries received subsidies under the Unconditional Cash Transfer program; we also made available [free] tertiary education and universal health care. Public utility drivers were given assistance through the Pantawid Pasada Program. There are complaints that some drivers did not receive any assistance at all. I have directed the DSWD and DILG to look into this.
I welcome the passage of the law postponing the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections. The postponement saved much-needed government funds and ensured implementation of projects under the current barangay officials. In hindsight, it also saved us from holding the polls while we dealt and continue to deal with the pandemic.
The Malasakit Centers Act has proven to be of great help to our less fortunate citizens needing medical services through a one-stop platform in government hospitals. We commend the initiative and work of Senator Bong Go in this regard as well as other significant pieces of legislation. As of today, there are 75 Malasakit Centers serving Filipinos all over the country. These centers will be of great help in ensuring that our people remain healthy and resilient during these challenging times.
The Salary Standardization Law of 2019 increases the salary of civilian government workers. I hope that this law will inspire our government workers to perform better and encourage young, brilliant citizens to join public service.
I appreciate the law establishing the National Academy of Sports. We can now give our deserving student-athletes the training and support they need to excel in their chosen field of endeavors.
With the commitment of key members of Congress and the Executive Department, the PHISGOC, Philippine Sports Commission, and the Philippine Olympic Committee were bound together with one vision to host the
30th Southeast Asian Games. Our athletes prevailed. More than that, we fostered pride, patriotism, genuine sportsmanship, and camaraderie in our South East Asian brothers and sisters. Indeed, we won as one.






To our business community and the general public, we assure you that the landmark Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act has been gaining momentum. We are closer to eliminating overregulation in government services.
Frontline processes, including consular services, processing of building and business permits, and services for overseas Filipinos and seafarers were streamlined. Passports and drivers‘ license validity were lengthened to ease the burden of the public.
We received a BBB plus credit rating despite a sea of credit rating downgrades and negative outlook revisions worldwide. [applause] The Japan Credit Rating Agency upgraded us from BBB plus to A minus last month.
Meanwhile, Moody‘s has affirmed and maintained the country‘s ratings at B2 — Baa2 rather. [Understand. Because of the light I have … My eyesight is not as good as new.] Our fiscal position is strong, our economic and fiscal management prudent and our banking system robust. We are in a better position to weather the crisis caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic.
We have accomplished significant infrastructure projects under the Build Build Build Program. I will not dwell lengthily on the nitty-gritty of our infrastructure accomplishments now lest I bore you. Instead we will release a comprehensive written report on our collective milestones and the details of accomplishments to remind us that perseverance, patience and determination will help us move forward even in the most difficult of times.
We issued last year Executive Order No. 100 establishing the Diversity and Inclusion Program as a national program of the Government. We want to end the discrimination of persons on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and other character traits.
My administration always believed that freedom from illegal drugs, terrorism, corruption and criminality, is itself a [human right].
Part of our efforts to uphold human rights is protection of the rights of children and the right against discrimination. Early last year, I signed Executive Order No. 92 creating the National Council Against Child Labor. Government efforts to protect the rights of children will be amplified to prevent, reduce and eliminate any form of child labor.






Our achievements along these lines have been extolled by an overwhelming number of our fellow member-States in the UN Human Rights Council, during its recently held 44th session last June.
Rest assured that we will not dodge our obligation to fight for human rights.
My countrymen, there are lessons to be learned from the coronavirus pandemic. It jolted us to realize that gains made after spending so much planning, effort, cost and time could diminish considerably and quickly for reasons beyond one‘s anticipation; that it is much easier to destroy than to build; that in a crisis of national proportions that affects every aspect of human life, governments need to have the support and cooperation of the people if it is to succeed in battling the cause of that crisis, that there are people who ask for compassion but show none themselves; that life, after all, is fickle like the weather.
The gains we achieved in the first three and a half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road towards a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered.
The global scale and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus.
In this regard I would like to express my gratitude to all those who made possible the steady supply of food, water, and basic utilities [to] our households [applause] and the provision of basic social services and financial assistance to our people. Our profound gratitude goes to everyone who helped keep our country‘s food supply chain running, the valiant soldiers, policemen and security guards who kept peace and order [applause] in our communities; the dedicated personnel who kept our essential establishments operational. You showed us kindness and selflessness. You gave us strength. You risked your own lives to serve the greater good in keeping with the Filipino spirit of Bayanihan. [applause]
I also thank the men and women of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases and the National Task Force against COVID-19 for all the countless hours it spent to keep the pandemic in check and for all the efforts it made to ensure the safety of our people. [applause]






Let me also recognize the efforts of the local government units that stepped up and initiated their own response measures to contain the effects of COVID-19 and its impact to their constituents. Have been — impact to its constituents. [The shadow says it’s a period there.]
I know exactly the difficulties you are undergoing. I pray that the officials of each LGU in our country – from the barangay to the autonomous regions – would set aside partisan politics and selfish interests to do what is right and good for all. [applause]
I likewise issued Executive Order No. 104, which imposed ceilings on the retail prices of at least 133 drugs and medicines, and directed a continuous review of the retail prices of others. This proved to be providential now that we are facing a pandemic.
To everyone who helped us in this time of great need, maraming salamat po. [applause]
Let me say that the strength of a nation rests in the hands of the people acting as one with government, in the pursuit of common goals and objectives.
When the pandemic struck, I decided to prioritize life over other considerations. According to experts, the interventions that the government had put in place prevented as much as 1.3 to 3.5 million infections. To me, even if the numbers were much lower, it would still be and would have been worth the sacrifice[s] we made. ―Buhay muna, bago ang lahat.” [applause]
We initially encountered difficulties ramping up our testing capacity. We now have 93 accredited testing laboratories nationwide and we are aiming to conduct 1.4 million tests by end of July and ensure a quick turnaround time of 48 to 72 hours.
Under the Social Amelioration Program, we allotted [PhP205 billion] for poor and low-income households who were affected during this pandemic — who thrive on a ―no-work, no-pay‖ arrangement. Admittedly, our implementation of the Social Amelioration Program was not perfect. And some opportunists turned crisis into opportunity. We will catch up with you sooner than you think.
We came up with the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program. We extended financial assistance to over 650,000 affected individuals in the formal sector, 110,000 OFWs abroad, and almost 83,000 repatriated OFWs. We also provided temporary wage employment [opportunities] to






displaced marginalized workers through the TUPAD Project. Our indigent senior citizens were also provided with a stipend for the [first] semester of the current year.
This health emergency stretched the government‘s resources to its limits. In response, the Office of the President worked closely with Congress for the quick passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.
May I again reiterate my thanks to you, the men and women of Congress, for the effort you invested into passing that law. I hope that we can get some or the same treatment of clarity, purpose and the
fastness [applause] to support the passage of the Bayanihan [to Recover as One Act], which will supplement funds for recovery and response against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We must facilitate the country‘s economic recovery. I call on Congress to fast-track the passage of proposed measures such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or CREATE Act. [applause] This immediately cuts the corporate income levy from the current 30 to 25 percent and give the government flexibility to grant a combination of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, among others. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer or FIST Act will set up mechanisms allowing banks and other financial institutions to dispose of and transfer non-performing assets and loans to asset management companies similar to Special Purpose Vehicles.
Our economic managers have seen infrastructure investment as an effective tool to help spur high growth, attract investments, create jobs, and achieve financial inclusion for all Filipinos. The [DPWH] has resumed the construction of the North Luzon Expressway Harbor Link, the NLEX-SLEX Connector, the Cavite-Laguna Expressway, the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, the R-1 Bridge Project, the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway Project, and the Subic Freeport Expressway Project, to name a few. To realize the maximum benefit from the country‘s investments, the infrastructure projects under the Build, Build, Build Program, which are labor and capital intensive, are not mere springboards for the country‘s swift recovery [post]-pandemic. They are economic benefits — economic benefits to be distributed to all corners of the country and push sustainability in urban centers, particularly [Metro] Manila.
The TESDA launched an online mode of livelihood and skills training. There are 71 free online training to help upskill trainees for the right opportunities. [opportunities, I’m sorry]






I ask the TESDA to come up with special training programs to retool our OFWs so they can find employment opportunities here at home. I am also calling on the CHED for scholarship programs for the qualified dependents of our OFWs. I direct the Department of Agriculture and DTI to come up with agri-business and entrepreneurship projects to help displaced OFWs rebuild their livelihood. Further, I ask the LANDBANK and other government financial institutions to continue providing low-interest loans to our
OFWs. Sa mga kababayan ko na naghihirap sa ibang bansa, nandito ang inyong gobyerno para matulungan kayo at inyong mga pamilya, lalo na sa panahong ito. [applause]
The government will intensify its efforts to help businesses, especially our micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs, by providing responsive government assistance and services, capitalization, and business operations support as we adapt to the next normal. [applause]
Nananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors – nananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors: malasakit at Bayanihan po sana ang pairalin natin ngayon. This is not the time to drive away lessees. During normal times they were the primary source of your income stream. Now, it‘s time to be fair and compassionate. Come up with amenable arrangement with your
tenants. Huwag po natin silang ipagtabuyan, tanggalan ng tubig, kuryente, at bubong. Commercial establishments are requested to give grace periods [or] allow deferment of payments, especially for MSMEs that were forced to close down during the quarantine period. Let us help them
recover. [applause]
We pump-primed the recovery and rehabilitation of MSMEs. The DTI, through the Small Business Corporation, set up the PhP1-billion COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program to provide zero-interest loans for MSMEs affected by the pandemic. As of July 10, 2020, over 2,600 loan applications worth [PhP182.5 million] have been approved. We are optimistic that this initiative will help our MSMEs stabilize and recover from their losses.
I also enjoin the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and banks operating in the country to provide regulatory relief for our MSMEs and allow loan payment extensions, without incurring penalties and charges. [applause] We need your help to prevent the collapse of companies saddled with accumulated amortizations and payables caused by the closure of their businesses at the height of the strict quarantine periods.
As we embark on these efforts towards inclusive recovery, we should acknowledge that all forms of government support will go to naught if the






new MSMEs do not thrive because of lack of consumer support. Ito ang panahon para suportahan natin ang ating mga kababayan [applause] na nagnenegosyo at gumagawa ng mga produktong sariling atin.
In the same manner, the tourism and recreation industries, which are among the hardest hit by the pandemic, count on our full support. While we slowly try to put the fun back in our local travels, the national government agencies and LGUs must harmonize their policies to boost tourism [while] ensuring everyone‘s well-being. We enjoin our people to help boost the economy by traveling locally [applause] [local na lang] once the necessary systems are in place.
The DoST offers its Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program to enable businesses to access training that will help them transition to online and contactless operations.
Now more than ever, we need to protect our consumers. I direct the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure the empowerment of Filipinos on their consumer rights, and coordinate strategies between public and private organizations in building a fair, safe, resilient, and sustainable economy. [applause]
There are welcome developments for the e-Commerce industry. But major economic activities take place in a borderless environment with meager regulatory controls. They expose consumers to various risks related to security, data privacy, and misrepresentation.
We must patrol the country‘s cyberspace and enforce online consumer and data protection and privacy laws. We must run after online scammers and those undermining the people‘s trust in online transactions. We must continue to protect Filipinos in the new normal and remind the world that we are responsible stewards of data. I am committed to protect both the physical and digital lives of our law-abiding countrymen. [applause]
The national government shall lead the way in our transition to online systems. I reiterate my call for all government instrumentalities to implement systems that shall make physical queuing a thing of the past.
Panahon na para mawala [applause] na ang pila para mapagsilbihan ang gobyerno nang walang kahirapan para sa tao. The DILG, DBM, and the ARTA, along with all agencies and instrumentalities of government, are hereby directed to make [all] possible services available online. We need to






adjust to and adopt a paper-less type business and work performance. We need e-governance [to provide] our people with the services they need [from] the comfort of their homes or workplaces. It will enable our bureaucracy to better transition into in the ‘new normal’ and cut or minimize red tape.
Until the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face- to-face teaching or learning unless [all] risks of exposure to sickness are eliminated. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our students and teachers. [applause]
Iyong…. About two weeks ago, I — I seemed to have said that I would allow the face-to-face classes to resume. But we were talking actually of January because my thinking is that by September, we would have the vaccine. How to get it from the producers or from other governments is really something which we have to deal with because everyone — the… It’s a global need and everyone will go for it.
But let me just mention it in passing that about four days ago, I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first or if it is needed, if we have to buy it, that we will be granted credit so that we can normalize as fast as possible.
Life that is lost is lost forever. Courses that are not substantial can be supplemented. Education that is delayed can be recovered.
We must implement online learning, modular learning, and TV- and radio- based broadcast, which students coming from different backgrounds can avail. DepEd will provide printed modules for those who cannot afford online learning.
In support of the Learning Continuity Program through blended learning, we plan to increase the number of schools with ICT equipment in the coming months.
The DepEd and the DICT are building up the Public Education Network or PEN that will connect all public schools and DepEd offices nationwide. We will prioritize the connection of all Last Mile Schools and those with no electricity supply can have it via satellite and energized via solar panels. By 2022,






before I step down, the PEN shall be realized. [applause] I‘m referring to the program. I will — I will do it.
TV frequencies reverted back to the government for whatever cause or reason [shall be used] exclusively to the exclusion of [private] persons or [their] dummies, to cope with the demand of the next normal. These will be used to provide uninterrupted quality education to our children in our shift to e-learning.
I am directing Secretary Guevarra, Secretary Dela Peña and Secretary Honasan, in collaboration with Secretary Briones, and Secretary Avisado, together with Secretary Dominguez, to come up with an integrated program and implementation mechanism to ensure that these TV frequencies are fully utilized by government through the facilities of PTV4 for the utmost benefit of the Filipino people. [applause]
Let me just — allow me to segue a little bit. For the remaining two years of my term, all that is good that belongs to government, whether it be the airwaves, whether it be the lines, or whatever that is good for the people, will belong to the government and it should be government who should be given the first option to utilize them. Ang sobra, kanila. [applause]
I call on our [telecommunication] companies to improve their services lest we be forced to take drastic steps to address the less-than-ideal service that the public is getting from you.
Alam mo sisingit na lang ako dito. I am… Sometimes we are a government pictured to be weak and incompetent because we cannot really force our mandate. Alam mo itong nagbibigay ng mga public services, you better improve.
Huwag naman ninyo kaming pahintayin sampung taon bago kami makakamit ng mga services that the other countries are enjoying. If it’s just a question of added capitalization or the infusion of money, go and look for it. Maghanap kayo because if you are not ready to improve — anak — I might just as well close all of you and we revert back to the line telephone at kukunin ko ‘yan, i-expropriate ko sa gobyerno.
Alam mo itong… I’ll be straight, iyong Smart pati itong Globe, ilang taon na ito, at ang sagot palagi sa akin, “the party cannot be reached.” Eh nasaan pala pumunta ‘yung y*** na ‘yon?
Eh kung ganoon lang naman ibigay ninyo sa amin, we are a republic, a sovereign country, bear that in mind because the patience of the Filipino






people is reaching its limit, at I will be the one to articulate the anger of the Filipino people. And you might not want what I intend to do with you.
Kindly improve the services before December. I want to call Jesus Christ to Bethlehem. Better have that line cleared. [applause] Alam mo sa totoo lang, at the end — naa-ano na ako sa inyo. I have been a citizen of this country and parang nilalaro lang ninyo ang…
Kayong may pera, p***. May pera kayo? Negosyo kayo. Wala kayong pera? P***, umalis kayo dito. You know, you give us half deals, half-cooked transactions, lousy service. Tapos ang tao nagbabayad.
Tell us now if you cannot really improve on it because I will work by December. I have two years. The next two years will be spent improving the telecommunications of this country without you. I will find a way. I will talk to Congress and find a way how to do it. [applause]
Last year, I said that distributing economic and business activities is imperative to our country‘s sustained and equitable growth. Today I reiterate that statement.
I issued Administrative Order No. 18, directing concerned agencies to strengthen the development of Special Economic Zones in areas outside Metro Manila.
I also issued Executive Order No. 114 to institutionalize the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa Program. This consolidates and refocuses existing economic and social welfare programs, activities and projects toward the countryside. It also [establishes] an [inter-agency] council, headed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, which will create a framework for the effective implementation of the project. [Kung hindi ninyo ako naiintindihan sa binabasa ko, mas lalo ako.] [laughter]
In 2021, we aim to increase access to healthcare services by continuously hiring and deploying more than 20,000 health professionals. This will augment health workforce in the LGUs, particularly in isolated and disadvantaged areas. We will implement projects to establish and improve Barangay Health Stations, Rural Health Units, and other healthcare facilities.
[But] we [still] need to address internal security. We are pursuing a whole- of-nation approach to bring peace and order and development in the countryside. We need to provide interventions and implement the Barangay






Development Program. This would provide cleared and threatened communities and… This refers to a program where the Armed Forces would play a vital role in the one-nation approach. This is what simply — mean by this. And that everyone, every agency of the government including the Armed Forces of the Philippines should participate. And I am aware of the skirmishes and the assassination of our soldiers and I said, ―Correct this so that we can proceed with the barangay implementation as fast as possible.‖
We have made significant strides in the past four years, but we need the support of local government leaders. We need your help to implement the Barangay Development Program.
Certain sectors expressed concerns when I declared martial law in Mindanao and its extension three times. But 2019 ended without my office requesting any further extension.
Martial law in Mindanao ended without abuses by the civilian sector, by the police, by the military. [applause] It ended because this time I know that they know how to love the country.
I thank Congress for its support to this administration‘s programs. Congress has been very productive. But much more remains to be done.
You know actually my speech if you followed it carefully, it‘s all a plea to Congress to do this, to do that, to make a law or craft a whatever.
And this one, I strongly urge Congress to pass a law establishing the Department of Overseas Filipinos [focused] solely on addressing the concerns of Filipinos abroad and their families.
I reiterate the swift passage — before that — before this… Kawawa kasi itong ating mga overseas. If it‘s only an office there in the Labor department they are overworked or for whatever reason, their needs, their pleas are not really attended to with dispatch and with care. OFW pati itong ano ngayon ito ̳yung sinabi ko kanina, they — I… I will go for it. We will need it to help them.
I reiterate the swift passage of a law reviving the death
penalty [applause] by lethal injection for crimes specified under the Comprehensive Dangerous [Drugs] Act of 2002. I did not hear so much clapping so I presume that [applause] they are not interested. Wala kang… Someday I‘ll tell you the story what happened to the Philippines.






Hindi ngayon. But when I‘m — sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo bakit nagkaganito ‘yung droga ng Pilipinas. Why the drug syndicates continue to operate just like the countries of Colombia, Mexico, and it is being played inside the national penitentiaries. Para tayong — talagang binababoy tayo. Sabihin ko sa inyo. But this is not a time for storytelling. SONA kasi ito so dito na lang.
This law will not only help us deter criminality but also save our children from the dangers posed by illegal and dangerous drugs.
May I be allowed with the indulgence of the body, itong bakit talaga ako galit sa droga. Let us make this a semi-formal speech. Alam mo kasi limang pamilya members o anim or pito, pagka bumagsak ̳yung tatay to drugs, the family crumbles. There‘s no more home to them. Droga, and if he‘s receiving a salary naglala — nagtatrabaho sa pantalan, 300 a day, tapos ang shabu is sold at two. He has about 100 to bring home. Kaya pagka ganun nagaaway- away na, ang mga bata hindi nakakapag-aral, ̳yung iba ligaw na mga babae into early prostitution kung ano-ano nangyari. Hindi lang alam nitong mga — – na this is happening all over the country everyday. And what is really very tragic is this, when the family starts to crumble, there‘s no home, and invariably the wife would look for another… Now the husband will look for a job usually easily doon sa abroad. At ̳yung asawa aalis, ̳yung bana — lalaki nasa droga, ̳yung mga anak iniiwan sa kapitbahay, sa kapatid. And the ferocity of the laws of the Filipino family home has been destroyed. Kaya kung anong mangyari nito the wife works in the Middle East. I am not zeroing on any particular country mind you. But alam naman natin there are tribes in the Middle East which would allow rape as part of the territory of being a househelp. Kasama ̳yan, kasama talaga ̳yan. So iyan ang mahirap diyan. You have a wife there being crucified, being used. Magpadala ng pera tapos ang mga anak nasa shabu na rin kasi these are the guys that the shabu people would really you know they stick by them until it crumbles, the resistance. And then you have plenty of this all over the country. Hindi lang nila alam ̳yung sinasabi nila na misery sa itong human rights, plus 10 ̳yan. Not to count the victims of crimes perpetrated by people addicted to shabu. That is the reason why I‘m so vicious in my — galit talaga ako kasi nilalaruan tayo. Well, I don‘t know any other president might — pero ako ayaw ko ̳yon. Ayaw kong lalaruan ang Pilipino. Do not do it in my country because I will really kill you. That is a commitment.
Owning safe, decent and affordable housing is every Filipino‘s dream. But the housing market remains inaccessible to most of our countrymen.






I renew my call for Congress to pass the National Housing Development bill and the Rental Housing Subsidy bill. These will enable all Filipinos— regardless of social status—to live in decent homes where their families can lead meaningful lives.
I also call on Congress to amend Republic Act No. 10912 [or] the Continuing Professional Development Act of 2016. In this time of great pandemic and forthcoming reconstruction, requiring our professionals to undergo seminars is burdensome and not realistic. This must end.
Ito pang isa, there are — may mga profession… Isingit ko na lang lahat tutal this is to inform the nation. May mga profession na they would require — I think it‘s the nurses — they would require them to come to Manila to retrain and — for another round of expenses. Itong mga seminar-seminar na ito dapat mahinto. I don‘t know in other provinces [applause] but during my time ̳yang — [ano ‘tong sa barangay na?] barangay expeditions ng mga opisyal, hininto ko rin ̳yan. Which reminds me, I will act on this also in due time.
We hail our health professionals as heroes. Now is the time to pass the Advanced Nursing — iyan ho — Nursing Education Act and the law instituting the Medical Reserve Corps.
COVID-19 will not only be the last pandemic. We need to create a National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better respond to future outbreaks. We count on Congress‘ full support. You can just let it remain for a while in the Department of Health kung wala pang pera but you have to expand the services or it will also entail a little bit of money but not really as much as expensive when you set up a department.
In the long term, we are looking into the creation of the National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better prepare for pandemics, protect lives, and allow development to proceed even in the worst of times. We are counting on the full support of Congress for this critically important endeavor.
I don‘t know but I‘ll leave it to Congress to really… It‘s another department. There seems that it could be a multilayer redundant thing between the health and the proposed department.
I call on Congress to prioritize the passage of a law for the Unified System of Separation, Retirement and Pension of the Military and Uniformed Personnel without however diminishing the benefits that our uniformed personnel are






entitled to under existing laws. [applause] There is a need to adjust the pension system which will be applicable only to newly-hired uniformed personnel so as not to cause a ―ballooning effect‖ against the budget of the military in the years to come and yet maintain the pension benefits of those already in service under the present law. This issue needs a solution
now. Umpisahan natin ngayon para hindi na maging problema sa susunod na mga taon.
I want to… You know one of the… This is not politicking, I am not running. I cannot run anymore. Iyong dinoble ko ̳yung suweldo ng pulis pati army it was really a clarion call para for them also to have a decent life and they are able to get the things which ordinarily cannot be reached by any government employee. Ang akin doon is ̳yung corruption that maybe it might be a vain attempt but maybe dagdagan ang suweldo para it would be a hedge against corruption.
We must also modernize the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Bureau of Immigration with urgency.
Alam mo sa Davao and if you go there I can show you, one of the serviceable trucks, fire trucks that we have in the City of Davao… Of course ang city mayroon ng sarili aside from the Bureau of Fire — Bureau of Fire which is really national, mayroon ‘yung Bureau of Fire. Would you believe it? Serviceable still. Ang pangalan ng truck, Studebaker. Ang katawan — ang talagang matatag ang katawan. Kaya ang makina, Isuzu. [laughter] Pero okay pa rin. It can put out fire. Totoo. This is how this Bureau of Fire issue na medyo na — na-overlook natin nang matagal.
I emphasize the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. Our people‘s safety cannot be delegated to a council or commission. Equally important is the establishment of evacuation centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country. We must act [now] before another major disaster shakes [us] into action.
The problem is disaster and even a fire cannot be — make — they cannot make a study for projection when the earthquake would suddenly come and make a big crack there. Hindi natin alam talaga.
Ang ibig kong sabihin, this will require more than just one brainwork kung paano talaga itong how to prevent or avoid disaster. It will be… By the way, just before starting, I was tempted to say it pero baka magtindigan kayo. It will be all right for me if Bong Go will just stay. Wala akong problema. Kasi sabi ko na this piece of speech of mine would be one of the longest SONAs






that I will deliver. Nakita ko ‘yung page pagbigay sa akin. Iyong ibang input, akin. But ‘yung iba lahat. Ang nangyari po, binalik ko sa kanila. ―Make it short.‖ Pagbalik sa akin, mas makapal na. “Naku, p***** i**.” Eh di nandiyan na ngayon. Ito na ngayon.
The responsible extraction and equitable distribution of natural resources remain among my non-negotiables. I reiterate the need for the passage of the National Land Use Act which has been pending for decades. Pakisilip lang ho ninyo ‘yan.
For the rest of my term, I hope to see concerted efforts in protecting the environment.
The rehabilitation of Boracay Island showcased our resolve to safeguard the environment. [applause] Boracay is doing well because of its scenery. If it‘s only a coconut and a black — white sand and water, wala ̳yan. Pero you add the — the visitors there, then it becomes a very tempting destination.
We have seen the remarkable reemergence of the Island back to its former glory. I want this sustained. I ask Congress to enact a law creating — importante ito — the Boracay Island [Development] Authority or BIDA. We need it.
I cannot stress enough the importance of agriculture. The growth of our economy depends on a robust agricultural sector.
We must utilize the coconut — ito, isa — we must utilize the [coco levy funds] for the welfare our coconut farmers and the development of our coconut industry. I urge everybody — both of the Executive Department pati ito — that ito ‘yung pera na nakuha doon sa na-sequester. And itong perang malaking ito, gagamitin ito for the welfare of the farmers.
The problem is, we can no longer trace who are the farmers of yesterday. Marcos was — Marcos is a distant star. We do not know. Ako, alam ko because we had a little piece also that was covered by the land reform. Hindi na natin malaman kung sino ang may-ari.
So I think Congress should look again and try to sort out how best the money can be utilized. I will not make any suggestion but I leave it to Congress to decide what to do with it.






I once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers‘ Trust Fund. Tulungan natin ang ating mga magsasaka pagka hindi mawawala ‘yang pera, bilyon ‘yan. [applause] Jusko po. Well anyway the… We have learned so many lessons along the way.
I am also requesting Congress to pass the Rural Agricultural and Fisheries Development Financing System Act.
We aim to provide adequate, accessible and affordable food for every Filipino [family] through the Plant, Plant, Plant Program. [applause] After the Build, Build, Build… I think this is easier to achieve. A few good men — a few good regional directors, DAR and the dedicated workers down below could make this thing a success. Mas madali ito kaysa Build, Build, Build. Ito Plant, Plant, Plant lang eh. It is more of a the — well, how you try to convince the farmers to cooperate with government for their benefit.
This PhP66-billion agricultural stimulus package will help the agriculture and fisheries sector recover. I hope so. [applause]
We need to build trust and confidence in online transactions, stronger protection for online consumers and enabling measures for online businesses is needed through the enactment of an Internet Transactions Act
(ITA). [applause] This is very good.
I thus direct the Department of Trade and Industry and other relevant [government] agencies to work closely with Congress in ensuring that the provisions of the proposed bill are responsive to the needs of the consumers while promoting the growth of e-Commerce in the country. [applause] If you are tired of clapping, you just say so. I can make a
shortcut. [laughter] Pabilisan lang ‘yan.
On the path to better governance, we travel with others. Partners – both old and new – have helped. For bolstering our antiquated public health system, for bringing home our laid off Filipinos overseas, for filling in supply gaps for crucial medical supplies and equipment and staple food, for these and many more, the Philippines thanks all friendly nations. We will never forget your kindness and your timely support.






Within ASEAN and beyond, the Philippines will continue to work with partners to address global perils and ramp up cooperation to secure for our peoples, greater peace, progress and prosperity.
The Filipino nation claims its rightful place in the community of sovereign states. Thus, we will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy. Let me be very clear about this.
May I cut my prepared speech? Alam mo, I read a little over three weeks or last month na the Americans would — intends to go back to Subic.
I will just put on record my thoughts. I have nothing against America, I have nothing against China but if you put bases here, you will double the spectacle of a most destructive thing just like Manila during the Second World War — during the retaking of this city. One of the most devastated cities in the world.
Kaya maglagay-lagay ka ng base at this time, this will ensure if war breaks out, because there would be atomic arsenals brought in, this will ensure the extinction of the Filipino race.
We worked without fail to protect our rights in the South China Sea, neither beholden nor a pawn to anyone. We broadened the boundaries of Philippine diplomacy. We built productive ties with everyone willing to engage us on the basis of equality and mutual respect. And, we redefined our relationships with our most important partners, placing the country in a far better position to advance our interests in an evolving regional order and emerging global problems. [applause]
Now, plenty of critics, both sides, claim about nothing has been done to retake forcefully or physically the South China Sea.
Alam mo, unless we are prepared to go to war, I would suggest that we better just call off and treat this, I said, with diplomatic endeavors.
China is claiming it. We are claiming it. China has the arms, we do not have it.
So, it is simple as that. They are in possession of the property. It will remain a property of a — if you’re a lawyer, property rights.






They are — it has nothing to do with the Philippine Laws of Property but it‘s akin to — they are in possession. So what can we do? We have to go to war and I cannot afford it. Maybe some other president can, but I cannot. Inutil ako diyan, sabihin ko sa inyo. And I’m willing to admit it. Talagang inutil ako diyan. Wala akong magawa. I cannot…
The moment I send my Marines there at the coastal shores of Palawan, tinamaan ng cruise missile lahat iyan. Hindi pa nga naka-set sail iyan eh, sabog na.
Let me say again that victory in the global battle against COVID-19 would take longer than we expect. Everyone‘s cooperation is needed. I know that you, the Filipino people, have sacrificed a lot. But we have no other choice but to work together and to do even more.
I must admit that our actions have been far from perfect — totoo iyan I admit it — and there could be improvements here or there—but all of us in government, including myself, assure you that we will not stop until we get things right and better for you. [applause]
I know that many of you are worried not only about health and safety but also about our ability to move around and ride public transportation; the depletion of your savings due to the rising cost of goods; and the loss of your incomes due to uncertainties in your jobs and livelihood. I assure you that your government will [squarely address] these problems and challenges to overcome them and proceed to the ̳new normal‘.
Marami ho talagang mawawalaan ng — those for the middle-income. They buy a car on installment basis. If you cannot keep up with the amortization, you’ll lose it — you‘ll lose the car and you are forced to ride on public utilities.
Concomitantly, didiretso rin itong mga criminal na rarami at crimes will increase. But let me assure you, for as long as I am President, there can never be a runaway crime in any of our cities. Hindi ako papayag ng ganun. I can assure you we will remain peaceful — relatively
peaceful. [applause] Hindi naman very peaceful. Pero kung sabihin mo na kagaya ng holdup dito, holdup, ah… Alam naman nila kung ano mangyayari. You know what will happen to you.
I am addressing myself to the criminals. You commit holdups, you commit rapes, you commit all sorts of things and you harm the public, then kaaway mo na ako. Kapag bumalik kayo sa dati kagaya noon, patong-patong na






naman ang patay dito. Sigurado hahanapin ko kayo. Do not ever go back to your old ways. Maghanap na lang kayo ng anong trabaho diyan. Magtiis kayo.
To open up the economy to pre-Covid-19 levels at this time is not an option because whatever good it can produce will only be gobbled up, or be outweighed, by the bad it will generate. Sometimes, haste does make waste. The recent upsurge of infections when we opened little windows to the resumption of business is proof of that.
I am happy that I have talked to you today. You know, in other places they opened up too early too soon. America is one. China — well fortunately, it was arrested on time. China and the rest for those who opened up and those who do not follow the protocols of the — at least the World Health Organization — they are suffering and they have at least 140 deaths.
Ang Amerika nagkukulang sila lahat. No nation on earth was really prepared for COVID. No amount of preparation because that kind of microbes visits about once every 100 years. Wala man ̳yung — mga tatay natin, what they suffered was Second World War, but tayo…
We are not ready and therefore we will not gamble with the lives and health of the people. Certainly, no one would want to end up on the negative side of the equation. Not me, not us.
All I ask is that you continue to put your faith in your government and work with us in achieving what is best for our country and our people. Together, let us do — mahirap basahin kasi dito eh — the most that we can to ensure that the health, safety and well-being of every Filipino—especially those severely affected —are taken care of.
Together, we shall fight this pandemic with the same fervor as our campaign against illegal drugs, criminality, insurgency, and corruption in high places and entrenched parochial interests.
As a government worker, I am addressing each and every Filipino that the government cannot do this without your help. More than ever, we need to






reinvigorate the deep-seated Filipino spirit of pakisama and malasakit within each and everyone of us.
We are being — we are being tested, as a people and as a nation. Worse times loom ahead. But I do hope that this spirit of solidarity and unity will serve as the drumbeat to which we shall march in unison in our quest for the light at the end of the tunnel.
I appeal to each and every Filipino, let us take care of one another. Ito ang panahon para magtulungan. Hindi ito ang panahon para maglamanan — maglaman — lamang-lamangan — lamang. Mamang p*** — dila
ko. [applause] Hindi maglamang — at pagkakaisa.
My faith in the Filipino innate patience, resilience and determination to bounce back is unwavering. Let us share our blessings with those who have little and those who have none. This is the time to bring out the best in us.
The woes that weigh heavily upon our shoulders may bend our back, but they shall not bend or break our spirit.
From the rubbles of adversity, a more resilient and stronger nation built on Bayanihan and Pagkakaisa shall rise.
Together, we shall overcome.
Before I… Pardon the time but it was really the allotted time for my speech. I would just like to give a statement between — between us sa gobyerno kung hindi tayo nagkakaintindihan.
You know Drilon, stand it — he was defending… I would like to ask Drilon, were you a part of ACCRA when this contract of Ayala water was being drafted?






And why are you fumigating? Bakit kasi ikaw lang ang galit? Na sabi mo na dynasty-dynasty. You are a hypocrite. You know that you cannot pass an anti-dynasty law. Ikaw ang nandiyan sa Congress, ̳di ikaw ang mauna dito.
But you know, to take it against me for protecting my country is something which I really resent. Alam mo you described using the dictionary the synonym ng mga oligarchs, oligarchy, kung ano, then you proceeded to characterize everyone every — every name and then said that oligarchy is not bad at all because sa — not all oligarchies are bad. True.
But ito, to my countrymen, the oligarchy that exists in this country is the oligarchy that existed during the Spanish time. And the Spanish lands and the friar lands and all the benefits that were passed on to the Insulares who did not go back to Spain or to the Spaniards and into their… But that was long ago, it has been forgotten. This is the oligarchy that controls the Philippines by what? By taking control of the water and the electricity and power. Iyan ang oligarchy mo Drilon. [applause]
Wala ng oligarchy dito except that. They have controlled. Look at… How can you now craft a new contract? Because I would insist that you pay the billions and billions that you collected.
For example, water treatment. O nandiyan sa kontrata. It‘s in the billing, they are being collected since 1997. Ilang bilyon na nga wala ni isa, not even a faucet was built for a water treatment facility.
Iyan ang mahirap sa… You do not protect the oligarchs here. You are the one. Ikaw lang mag-isa. And I suspect that you were also the one — or helped when you were there in the ACCRA.
We do not even know the — ang mga abogado sa public documents hindi nga alam. Hindi nga natin alam kung naka-graduate ba o hindi. Wala. Would you think Ayala would get the services of those…? Ayala got ACCRA. ACCRA did it. Ikaw galing ka doon, most of you, more successful lawyers sa corporation, you handle big corporate. Iyan ang mahirap.






Bangga tayo dito. Me, hinawakan ninyo eh. Hindi ka puwede kay… Kita mo noong nag-increase, walang tubig, pinuputol ̳yung tubig, ang tao bumigay kasi hindi puwede man tayo hindi maligo, hindi uminom. Electricity ayaw mo mag-increase. O ayan, wala ka, palaging brownout, lahat.
I‘m sorry but I have to say this to you. I do not like it. It‘s not the time for it, but since it is the time for the SONA, for people to know and people to really get the facts, then — and the right of the people to be heard.
Tayo na naman ang tao magsabi. Hinawakan ninyo ̳yang tubig pati electricity, iyon ang oligarchy talaga. Kaya ako sinabi ko noong kampanya ―corruption is not here.‖ Iyang mga Customs na ̳yan, maliit ̳yan. It‘s there upstairs. And I was really — and providential, dumating ̳yung panahon na hindi ko hiningi. Then I saw the contract. Noong nakita ko ̳yung contract…
At saka ̳yang linya na ano, ̳yung choice — trans — ̳yung linya ng ano, it belongs to government. The best of the transmission lines, whatever, government gets it first before anybody else.
Thank you. I am through. [applause]

	President of the Philippines 
	to the Congress of the Philippines


	Session Hall of the House of 
	Representatives


	[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 26, 2021]

Kindly sit down.
By far this is the most beautiful SONA crowd that ever happened here. [applause and cheers] So many — so many beautiful faces and you only have to guess when you see the full face of the person.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Lord Allan Jay Velasco and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Joseph Ejercito Estrada; the Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the justices of the Supreme Court; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Dean of the Diplomatic Corps His Excellency Archbishop Charles John Brown and the distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps; my fellow government workers; and of course to my lovely wife Honeylet; mga mahal kong kababayan [applause].
When I assumed the presidency five years ago, dominant in my mind were dreams and visions of a better life for all Filipinos. I saw them as reachable through the institution of reforms and radical changes in both the structure of government and the mode of governance — changes designed [to yield] responsibility [and] accountability. All in consonance with the truth that public office is a public trust.
When I ran for the presidency, I just made fundamental promises and strangely you can count them by the fingers of your hand. I made those changes, which I thought that was really at that time doable.
To offer free education — it’s there already — the Universal Health Care [applause], nandiyan na po; the fight against illegal drugs, [applause] criminality and corruption; and the development of infrastructure, including free irrigation and other big ticket projects, which I thought I did not have the funds to do it, but per chance, among others, they were done in my term.
Today as I approach the end of my term, I have less visions but more remembrances. But mine is not to rue or to second guess what might have been, but to bear and respond with urgency [to the impact] of unforeseen events as they unfold.
Even before I took my oath of office, [I] – and everyone else, I suppose – knew the gravity [and] enormity of the problems that the country was facing. And precisely because of that awareness, I was driven to hasten the implementation of changes which I believed the country needed, keeping in mind that the Constitution afforded me only six years to make those changes happen. Making a difference within the constitutional time-frame is what I was up against. But no one gets by legally without worming through the needle’s eye of constitutional imperatives.
That is why I cajoled, I shoved, I pushed, and I tangled with men of wealth and influence who were oblivious to the anguish and pleas of the weak and impoverished. And for that, I was pilloried to no end. But I did not succumb to the attacks. And neither did I allow criticisms, however intense, to dampen my determination and initiatives, because my purpose was pure and unpolluted. [applause]
While we were busy instituting reforms, the twin ogres of illegal drugs and corruption laid low for a while only to resurface us — still with us, and make no mistake about it corruption is but another term for stealing people’s money, dashing, in its wake, a nation’s goals and aspirations.
Due to the brilliant programs and excellent work of our economic managers and the extraordinary cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches of government, our economy, with investor confidence, was poised to leapfrog into the company of the world’s fastest growing economies until the COVID-19 pandemic stalled everything.
Be that as it may, allow me this opportunity to extend my personal and the nation’s gratitude to all those who selflessly gave their all in the fight against COVID-19. Our health workers and other frontliners who risked their own safety [applause] to keep our essential health services and our food supply chain running, [boost] economic activity, and ensure peace and order in our communities.
I would like also to extend my deepest appreciation for the generosity of the private sector who came to the government’s aid in fighting COVID-19. [applause] I am profoundly thankful for your sustained assistance to our fellow Filipinos, [applause] amidst the same deleterious effect of the pandemic to your respective industries. Let me assure you that the government is committed to assist the private sector to regain the commercial vibrance of the country prior to the pandemic. [applause]
To our local [chief] executives, this pandemic pushed you to step up and deliver responsive assistance. I am glad to have seen you undertake new and heightened responsibilities, working doubly hard to protect your constituents. [applause]
To the international development partners who extended a helping hand amidst the global health emergency, the Philippines remembers your kindness and goodwill with sincere gratitude. [applause]
And to all of you who answered the call to protect one another by adhering to our nation’s [health] protocols, daghang salamat. [applause]
But then, let me ask, perhaps you and to myself: What exactly is the state of the nation today in the light of the pandemic which has paralyzed business activities and crippled even the strongest of the world’s economies? So where do we go from here?
[Looking Back to our Accomplishments]
In my first SONA, I laid down with utmost commitment and resolve the overall direction of my presidency: a comfortable life for all Filipinos anchored on a people-centered approach to development and governance. If I remember correctly, my administration, I said, will implement a human approach to development and governance, in our people’s welfare in the areas of health, free education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for the culture.
I bore no illusion that steering the nation towards a comfortable life for every Filipino would be easy. Indeed, the past five years have truly been challenging and humbling. I stand here before you today bearing no conceit, but if there is one thing that I could be proud of is that not once did I waver in doing the unpopular even if it meant upholding the greatest good for the greatest number. [applause]
Before I took office, our country was beset with a communist insurgency scattered across the nation, a separatist movement that sought to divide us on the basis of religion and religious differences, and the proliferation of illegal drugs and criminality.
Our armed forces were ill-equipped to deal with internal and external threats, while the police force had been overwhelmed by criminality and the drug trade problem. This is why I made it a priority to strengthen the institution and boost the morale of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the Philippine National Police, and other armed services. [applause]
Again, I thank Congress for working with the executive department in enhancing the capabilities of the AFP and the PNP through our modernization program.
In 2018, we raised the salaries of our military and uniformed policemen and personnel [applause] to a level commensurate to the critical role they play in upholding national security and maintaining order.
I am asking Congress to pass a Unified System for Separation, Retirement and Pension of Military and Uniformed Personnel to maintain [applause] government fiscal flexibility and provide adequate benefits and remuneration to our men and women in uniform. This shall apply only to the new entrants of the Military and [Uniformed] Services.
Hindi ho lahat. It cannot be that we have to pay so many, even the salaries of the retired. They get a chunk of the big budget. And if we include the new entrants, the funds available for them would not be enough.
It is also high time for us to pass a law providing Free Legal Assistance to AFP and PNP Officers and Enlisted Personnel [applause] to help [defend] them from charges arising from incidents related to the performance of official duty. [applause]
The continuous upgrading of our defense capability shall ensure that we shall uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty from external and [internal] security threats, among the new additions. [applause] We welcomed the country’s two missile-capable warships, to enable us to protect our seas.
By providing them with the necessary equipment, by enhancing their professional capabilities, and looking after the families of the soldiers who would not be longer be in their company. We do not only strengthen our military and police institutions — we also inspire them to serve this nation with the highest degree of loyalty and patriotism. We enabled them to carry out their mandate to defeat all enemies of the state whatever the cost.
Indeed, I am proud of the accomplishments of our troops in securing our nation against all threats to our democratic institutions. [applause] But peace must be realized — peace and security is not only just a military concern. That is why we deviated from the traditional purely military approach in dealing with matters of national security.
With the creation of the National Task Force to End [Local] Communist Armed Conflict or NTF-ELCAC, [applause] we have made great strides in addressing the root causes of this conflict by empowering our kababayans who have been used by the communists for so many decades.
In our continuing effort to build safe and conflict-resilient barangays, we have worked towards the sustainable rehabilitation and development of communities where the communists used to operate.
Through the NTF-ELCAC, we invested in farm-to-market roads, school buildings, water and sanitation [systems], [applause] health stations, and livelihood [projects].
Alam mo, kasali na tayo dito lahat. Always every law or every regulation must pass Congress, of course, to the President. But sometimes, you know, in our… Well, in the performance of our duties, we encounter the not-so-nice of confronting each other.
But because of these interventions, more than [17,000] former communist rebels have surrendered to the government. They have returned to the fold of the law and are happily reintegrating to [society], [the Enhanced Community Local Integration Program] or E-CLIP. [applause]
It’s either I am talking too fast or too slow or the operator of this thing here is drowsy. [applause] Maybe because I had so many ad libs along the way. Marami ho akong akin lang. Kaya ‘yung… [applause] Nahinto ako. When I stop and I process something in my — the gray matter between my ears — hindi humahabol o hindi alam ng operator.
Hindi bale, ma’am. Mahal pa rin kita. [applause] Lalaki ba ito o ‘yung mga babae? Kagabi ‘yung mga babae. Sila? O sabihin mo sa kanila makipagkita ako mamaya. I will embrace them for their punctuality in operating this ano — this strange machine that [applause] gives you the speech.
With the support of our local government units, I am confident that support for the communist movement will continue to erode in the next few months. [applause] And like the decades-old Moro rebellion in Mindanao, we will also bring an end to the armed struggle of the communists once and for all. [applause]
Sa totoo lang, itong komunista college pa ako. Hanggang ngayon, ang mga — sige pa rin. So… Speech-speech man lang ito. Kunwari lang pero ang totoo there’s a lot of fighting going on in the countryside. But I’d like to credit the police and the military for destroying so many communist fronts. [applause] I think they have destroyed more than 15 apparatus of the fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines.
Alam mo, mag-istorya muna tayo sa taxation. I’d like to be frank with you. Everybody, as everybody in this country, are paying taxes to the communists. The Communist Party earns billions but pass on a little to their fighting men who die for an ideology that is so rotten and corrupt.
They themselves are pocketing the money and their children are studying in Europe and in other places, which I think none of you here can finance such journey. Iyan ang masakit dito. They collect taxes, support Sison in Netherlands, and they do nothing but bad-mouth the government and mouth the war dogmas and everything.
Hindi na sila napagod. It’s about 53 years in the making. And until today, the poor people are dying. The cadres and most of them belonging to the indigenous tribes of our country are fighting a losing battle between the communist and the government. They waste lives, they enlist children and they are proud of it, but they deny it.
But when you go to the mountains such as I and Senator Go many times, even during the elections, they were there with so many arms that I think somebody — an idiot here in the Philippines supplied the firearms.
I’d like to ask Congress, especially Senator Bato, kindly dig on because we have identified the person who imported the AK-47 into this country on the pretext of using it in the security — providing security and guards in all, in business establishments and for those who can afford their home.
This policeman, I think, is still there. He was a colonel and he is still… Walang nangyari. At maraming sundalong namatay dahil sa mga armas na pinasok nila dito sa Pilipinas.
So that my orders to the — to you, if you see them walking around, kindly shoot them dead. I would be happy. Anyway, you are already charged in the ICC together with me. So what is the problem of adding another one? Another idiot Filipino who has caused great damage to our country. Iyan ho ang totoo diyan. At itong mga pulis…
But let me go back in time. When I first said I will fight drugs in six months, I thought it was like in Davao. You can either coerce, intimidate or bribe them, or give them money, I said, “Lumabas kayo ng Davao. Doon kayo magkalat sa Luzon at sa ibang lugar, huwag dito sa Davao.” Naniniwala naman ang mga ulol at we were able to attain a sense of normalcy in the city. Iyon ho ang totoo.
There are people charged with corruption and even going to prison for just maybe not telling the truth in their itong assets and liabilities, nakukulong. Eh p***… Itong mga pulis who are doing their thing, their drugs, they were the manufacturers and they were the distributor of drugs. When I became President, I asked Dela Rosa — he was the chief of police of my city — I promoted him direct to be PNP chief. Four star na kaagad automatic. But I told them, I told him and the others, “Look for the enemies. Look where — for where they are and if you find them, destroy the apparatus, destroy all from the manufacturers to the peddlers because we are fighting a drug war that was being participated in the business by nine generals of the PNP.”
Kaya ‘yan ang masakit sa loob ko. I did not know that I was fighting my own government. Customs and everyone else were facilitating the importation of drugs. And one importation, as you can see it every night on TV, the police now seize about almost a billion worth of drugs everyday.
And if you look at the [8888], there are about a thousand Filipinos arrested everyday by the police in connection with drug trafficking. And that is why I go crazy looking at the situation. They are still around. We do not have the laboratories now because nawala na sila at itong naiwan ngayon are doing the importation.
The citizens of another country cooked their shabu in their — [Anong tawag nitong…?] — in their tugboat or something and they threw out the product in — contained in the plastic bags and with GPS attached to the contraband so that the importers here could find them easily. That is how we are fighting almost losing a battle against drugs.
And now the [Sinaloa] gangsters of Mexico and the Triad of Laos in that area, they are busy cooking and we have the Filipinos here with no — with nothing in their mind except to destroy a nation — distributes them. That is what I said.
I’ve been asked the question and several times I gave the answer. I am a Filipino and I love my country. I do not want my country in disarray because of drugs. I do not want families break up and become dysfunctional. Iyon ang masakit sa akin.
When there — if you want to destroy a family, look for a way of the member or a resident of that family home, bigyan mo ng droga. ‘Pag nandiyan na ‘yung droga at they are hooked, and that is the end. Sometimes families are separated because of drugs, becomes dysfunctional, at ‘yung mga asawa magpunta doon sa abroad, ika nga, to look for jobs.
And you know, in the Middle East — I am not attributing it to any particular country — but there are tribes in the Middle East who are employing our Filipina citizens and they are uniform. Everybody who comes here home ask them how many hours of sleep they have? They said it’s only three to four hours and the food is hogwash.
And they sacrifice because they send money to the families back home and thinking all the time that the money was spent usefully, only to realize when she comes home that that family has already dispersed to nowhere.
Bakit ‘yan? Because itong mga durugista sa baba, itong peddlers, itong basurero tawag — it’s a street lingo — they look for families na may mga nanay, tatay nagtrabaho — ang tatay or nanay nagtatrabaho sa abroad. And to think na iniiwan nila ang mga anak nila kung saan-saan na lang, to their neighbors at a tender age of three to four, five, it breaks your heart.
Iiwan lang nila sa kapitbahay kung walang mga relatives. And then when they come back five years, four years after, they now realized that their young sons and daughters have gone into prostitution because of drugs and their boys or the fem — the male are nowhere to be found and into the drug business also. Iyon ang pinakamasakit.
Masakit sa akin na ang Pilipina pumunta doon para magtrabaho because sexual abuse in some tribes in the Middle East have this notion that if you are a slave or you are a paid person working for them, sexual abuse becomes part of the territory. Kaya diyan ako pumuputok at nakikita ko ‘yung mga pamilya na sira.
And to think that they labored without sleep, eating, I said, garbage, and not being allowed to go to their own church to pray for that is prohibited by them. And we have been just because of the money that they get, we just look the other way around. But still being — you know, bothered every night and they… What will happen to the next succeeding group of…? That is why I have in this speech a talk about slavery.
Pero ‘yan magprangka ako uli, I would never deny and the ICC can record it: Those who destroy my country, I will kill you. And those who destroy the young people of our country, I will kill you. Talagang yayariin kita because I love my country.
You can do it the legal way but it would take you months and years. And you know what? The statistics, I just learned the other night, that plenty of those who are in the middle class have been released from prison despite the fact that they are charged with trafficking, which is non-bailable and most of them are out. Babae pati lalaki ang kaso. And that is why I said I toyed with the idea — I said, if there is still a space — with due respect to the Senate President, he is a good man, he can become a good vice president. He is holy. Ngayon hindi na siya nahuhuli, noon huling-huli siya. But with due respect to Senator Sotto, who is also running for the vice presidency, he is a capable man, a good man and a Filipino. [applause]
Sige ako tingin sa harap, nandito pala sa likod ko. [laughter] You know when you are old — I have been in politics, mayor for 23 years; five years as a congressman, dito, I worked here; and four years of working as vice mayor for my daughter Sara; and the presidency. I have been in politics almost — 23 plus four, plus four — almost 40.
Kaya kung — hindi ko na malaman ang seat arrangement dito. Hindi ko alam nandoon pa ang mga Senate President pati… Buti’t na lang hindi ko sinali si Velasco. Baka hindi na ako makabalik doon maya. ‘Di bale, diretso na ako uwi.
I have said many times before: The bloodshed caused by the separatist movement in Mindanao is all about correcting the historical injustices suffered by the Moro people since the period of colonization. With the help of Congress, we were able to pass the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, [applause] finally fulfilling a promise that was decades in the making.
Our victory in Marawi is also a testament to how the Filipino’s patriotism is far stronger than any extremist group. As I have said before, many times, there is no room for lawlessness in this country. [applause]
Rebuilding a better Marawi remains today, still not completed. To Task Force Bangon Marawi, we need to race against time. And you have to finish the necessary work to rehabilitate the war-torn city and bring back its [displaced] families back home.
Now let me talk again about the drugs. I was just ahead because I was talking something else. Nag-segue ako.
While we have made great strides in ending rebellion and insurgency in various parts of the country, we still have a long way in our fight against the proliferation of drugs. This problem has hounded our country for several decades — destroying families and degrading the moral fiber of our society.
When I assumed office, I committed to end this problem at the soonest possible time. We launched an unprecedented war against the illegal drugs and to destroy their apparatus that permeated every level and sector of society. We waged war on the manufacturers, the financiers, the suppliers, the peddlers, and the entire syndicates and, more importantly, their protectors in government. We have rescued and reformed drug dependents because of their idiotic sense of decency by [launching] interventions and building facilities not only for their rehabilitation, but also to prepare them to reintegrate into society.
Our unyielding campaign led to the surrender of millions of drug dependents; and neutralization, capture and prosecution of thousands of drug personalities; the dismantling of illegal drugs and syndicates and the drug laboratories; the extensive drug-[clearing] of communities down to the barangay-level, and the cutting of narco politics.
You know, just allow me a little bit of your time. Wala naman siguro kayong lakad ngayon, unless na you want to — unless you have this appointment with… I’m sure hindi babae ‘yan. That would be a sexist statement. But kung nagmamadali talaga, halos tumatakbo, babae ‘yan. Kung naglalakad lang nang natural, medyo less important ‘yan. Ganoon ‘yan pero dito, wala. I am not making any sexist — I’m just saying — I’m just saying the truth. What is the truth? It’s there for all to see.
Let me talk about our quest for infrastructure development.
Five years ago, the first thing I made sure was to increase our infrastructure spending to an average of five percent of the country’s GDP. This is significantly higher than the infrastructure spending of each and [of the] past four administrations. Thanks to the comprehensive tax reform program that enabled us to fund critical infrastructure projects. Today, we can see the tangible results all around.
MRT-3, with its frequent breakdowns and unloading of passengers midrail, was a horror that was for the daily commuters to endure in the past.
Now, MRT-3 no longer unloads passengers but to their destinations. The waiting time between trains has been significantly reduced. [From] 10 trains running at only 30 kilometers per hour before, now [MRT-3] runs 23 trains at 60 kilometers per hour. [applause] We have taken away the misery of public commuting.
We also pursued the completion of the LRT-2 East Extension Project. [applause] By extending Line 2 and adding two more stations, we have reduced travel time between Manila and Antipolo from the usual two or three hours to only just 40 minutes. [applause]
Thanks to our partnership with the private sector, we were able to open Stage 3 of the Metro Manila Skyway in January this year. [applause] This decongested EDSA and other major roads in Metro Manila. [applause]
On Independence Day last month, we also inaugurated the Kalayaan Bridge, part of the BGC-Ortigas Center Link Project, [applause] which will reduce the usual one hour travel time between the two business districts to just 12 minutes.
Beyond Metro Manila, we are pursuing several high-impact projects that will be completed within my term and perhaps in the following years. It’s a question of money.
Just this July, we inspected the newly-built passenger terminal building of the Clark International Airport. [applause]
The new and modern passenger terminal is equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology. This can accommodate 8 million passengers, alleviate air traffic congestion at the NAIA Airport, as well as serve as a major growth driver and gateway for Northern and Central Luzon. [applause]
Madali man ang magpakpak, ang basa ang mahirap. [cheers and applause]
To help promote equitable development, we also completed several roads leading to important trade corridors. Last year, we completed the construction of the Poro Point Freeport Zone Road in La Union, which improved — [applause] nakita na ninyo ‘yan? Wala, sige lang pakpak. [laughter] You do not even have a picture of what I am talking about, I’m sure — to improve access to prime spots for investments and tourism in the Poro Point area.
We also completed the Junction Lanao-Pagadian-Zamboanga City Road, which will provide easier access to farms and easily transport their agricultural products at low cost and in great quantities to industries and economic zones located in Diplahan, Zamboanga Sibugay. [applause]
The Sorsogon City in Bicol, inuna namin ‘yan kasi mahal ko ang mga Bicolano. [applause] Pangatawanan ninyo ‘yang pakpak ninyo ha, baka…
The Sorsogon City Coastal By-Pass Road is targeted for completion by the end of 2021 while the Davao City Coastal Road will be completed by 2023.
Bakit? Why? Why is Davao last? Kasi sinabi ko sa kanila, unahin ninyo ‘yung buong Pilipinas. During the initial years of my presidency, I told the economic managers and the DPWH, pati si Art Tugade sa Transportation, “Unahin ninyo ang Luzon at ibang areas sa Mindanao. Do not look into the political entrails of the city and the other provinces.” Sinadya ko talaga na ipanghuli ang Davao.
Kaya ang — for the Davaoeños, you must understand that we cannot really unahin natin iyong — kasi taga diyan ako eh. Kung hindi ako sigurado taga-Davao, tapos na ‘yan pareho ng iba. Kaya lang sinabi ko, make Davao the last priority. [applause]
Totoo ‘yan. Sorsogon is a — a little politics, but that’s the territory of our Vice President Leni Robredo. Are you here, Ma’am? Ah, Zoom. Mayroon ho kayong… [applause] Sorsogon at iba pa.
We have inaugurated new highways, roads and skyways. We have bought new trains. These are all testament that we have greatly eased the grueling experience of traveling and commuting.
And to sustain our momentum in infrastructure development, I have directed the DPWH, DOTr, NEDA, Department of Finance and DBM to be on full speed to ensure that our flagship projects will be completed within my term, [applause] especially those that would help disperse economic activity outside the densely populated Metro Manila.
I thus earnestly call upon our LGU and private sector partners to help us [go on] full speed towards the realization of our flagship [infrastructure projects] and others.
Let me talk about — let me dwell about governance.
As we improved connectivity, we worked towards greater convenience for our travelers. We have extended the validity of Philippine passports to 10 years to lessen the burden of our [international] travelers and OFWs. [applause]
We have also gone beyond merely addressing the three million backlog of driver’s licenses in 2016. [applause]
We also extended for the new cards the validity of the driver’s license to five years, and addedly, we shall begin the issuance of these driver’s licenses within 10 years — which would be good for 10 years if there is no traffic violation. [applause]
So punta ka doon sa LTO, maybe you have a good sight. Mayroong ano ‘yan eh, I think there’s an examination there somewhere to test your ability to drive safely. And you go back 10 years after, and you think that you good — you still have a good sight and your reflexes are still good.
Ten years, maraming banggaan ‘yan, sigurado ako. You know, after 10 years, no after five, there should be a stricter measure to issue the 10 years validity of a driver’s license by imposing stringent requirements to test the essential functions of eyesight, then the hearing. Iyong iba hindi na nakakarinig ng silbato eh.
And so I have to… You know, 10 years is too long. I like it, it’s good. But we should have, as I said, in five years, we should go there for a medical makeover. Tingnan lang kung kaya pa mag…
Not only did we extend the validity of licenses and passports, we also sought to make long lines a thing of the past by streamlining government processes. These efforts are embodied in the Ease of Doing Business Act, which Congress passed [in] 2018. Thank you, Congress. [applause]
Sa inyo ‘yun. Ako ang nagpirma pala, ako nag-execute, pakpak rin kayo. [applause] Dapat ganoon ang SONA, sabihin mo lahat at sabihin mo na your — not really your qualms, but your misgivings somewhere there.
[Government] transactions will be further streamlined with the roll-out of the Philippine Identification System or the PhilSys through the Philippine Identification System Act. With this, we hope to facilitate better access [to basic services] for all Filipinos even in the far-flung areas. I want to say something about this but I’m taking too long, you know.
We also ensured the modification of the Salary Schedule for Civilian Government Personnel through the Salary Standardization Law 5 [applause] — a necessary measure for our civil servants to recognize their work and accomplishments as well as a gesture of gratitude and good will.
We have this legacy and we hope to pass on the establishment of the Central Business Portal, a single site for all business-related transactions such as securing business permits, licenses, and clearances. Launched earlier this year, it shall elevate our global standing in the doing business arena and improve our country’s competitiveness.
Alam mo ito, ‘yung queuing, when I was a mayor — I don’t know, but maybe a legislator or a senator or a congressman, well not really he is higher than the others, but kung dumaan ka as a local government employee worker, just like me, for 23 years, itong queuing matagal ko na ito.
In Davao, ang passport issuances nandoon sa likod ng SM. Isang gabi nag-motor ako, nakita ko ‘yung mga paa sa semento. So I was thinking, “Anong nangyari dito?” So nagbaba ako, sabi ko, “Bakit dito kayo natutulog?” Sabi nila, “You know, Mayor, ang pagbukas niyan kailangan nakapila na kami, ‘pag hindi, sunod — ibang araw na naman kami.”
So I called for the chief of office and I said, “Look I may not be the person above you supervising, but make sure that this thing will not happen tomorrow, as in tomorrow.” Tapos tinawagan ko ang — itong ano, sabi ko, “Why don’t you give cards?” Kung marami sila paglinya, may maglakad na marshal, “O ito, ikaw bukas at 4 p.m.” So you have to study the time and motion of people doing work.
Sabi ko, “Ayaw ko dito sa Davao.” Because in Davao — in Mindanao, nasa Davao ang ano eh ang issuances ng passport. So ngayon pagka-Presidente ko, sabi ko, “Ayaw ko nang makita ‘yan.” Not during my time, not during my time. Maghanap ka ng ibang panahon. Ayusin ninyo ‘yan. I do not want people queuing under the heat of the sun and rain.
Kaya sabi ko, “’Di magbigay kayo ng card.” They should go to one window, magkuha kayo kung kailan sila makabalik. So divide — I said, study your time and the motion of, you know, the process of… And dito nangyari na because I insisted.
Today, there is no more queuing, especially in the National Office — Statistics Office, nakita ko. Talagang sabi ko na, “Either you fix that thing or I will resign tomorrow because I could not bear to see those people. Hindi sa panahon ko. Kung hindi ko madala, hindi ko man kayo mapatay, hindi ko kayo mabugbog, ako ang aalis sa gobyerno.” Sabi ko, “Ayusin ninyo ‘yan. Hindi ko gustong makita ‘yan.”
Since 2016, the Office of the President has issued 138 Executive Orders, 43 Administrative Orders, 86 Memorandum Circulars, 52 Memorandum Orders and 1,038 Proclamations. These issuances have [become] integral guideposts in government administration and development agenda.
The Office of the President has demonstrated careful stewardship of the powers, by initiating reforms. We upgraded and improved the systems and processes to ensure that it can provide the best service to the institution of the presidency and the offices under it and ultimately the Filipino people.
To further promote transparency and accountability in government, we also issued the order on Freedom of Information [that] opens up the records, [applause] transactions, decisions and issuances of all government agencies. In relation to this, we also have the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission that is tasked to run after corrupt and erring government officials and bring them to justice. [applause]
Alam mo, I don’t know if you perhaps have come to know about this. I have ‘yung Pastillas sa ano sa airport. There were 43 personnel involved. I fired them all. Talagang pinaalis ko sa gobyerno. Nagbalot pa nga ako ng pera sa pastillas. Sabi ko kay — “Magbalot ka, lagyan mo ng pera kay ito ang ipakain ko sa kanila.”
Tinawag ko 43 of them from the Immigration. Mabuti’t na lang nandiyan si Justice Secretary Guevarra so that prevented me from doing it because kung hindi siya dumating — and I never expected him to be there — bigyan ko isa’t isa ‘yung papel at ipakain ko talaga ‘yung pera sa kanila. “Gusto mo ng pera? Hala kainin mo.” That is the best way of… Then, you fire them.
Customs, 73 plus 42. And everyday you have about — we have dismissed about 200 government personnel but some I did not allow the publication because ayaw — may mga pamilya eh.
So of late, ‘yung sabi nila na huwag na lang ano kasi nasasaktan ‘yung mga pamilya. So ngayon, wala na. I have stopped it. But there is no — there is no saying that we cannot reimpose it again for all of these idiots. I still have about a year to go. I will — I will reach you somehow.
But corruption, it’s endemic in government. You cannot stop corruption. Nobody can stop corruption unless you overturn the government completely. If I were the next president, if you think there’s really a need for you to change everybody in the system, then you declare martial law and fire everybody and allow the new generation to come in to work for the government.
Eh kung hindi mo ganunin, walang mangyari. Nandiyan — it’s in the system eh. Kagaya ng drugs, sino ba namang maniwala na nine — nine generals sa pulis were into trafficking of drugs? And because they are — they are policemen, the charges simply just, you know, disappear there. Because the prosecution, the investigation which form part of the vital documents in court, wala eh. Nobody was investigating because they are also policemen.
Kaya ‘yan kahirap ang ano. Kaya kung gusto mo itong mga ‘to, talagang… The only way to do it just call them and say, “Look for another job. Don’t — don’t…” Ganoon kahirap.
Now, let me pursue my talk with the foreign policy of the country. In the international arena, we have vigorously pursued an independent foreign policy centered on the promotion and protection of our core national interests. Yet… [applause]
Sigurado kayo sa pinakpakan ninyo? I was just laying the predicate of what I am going to say. Yet we conti — I will just give the cue then you clap your hands. [laughter] If I… Yet we… Biro lang ‘yan ha.
Yet we continue to work with all nations and seek partnerships that work. Because despite differences, it still is an interdependent world where interests and objectives intersect.
Now, partners – heretofore silent or equivocal – have expressed [key] principled positions that echo our own: that [in] disputes and contested areas, the majesty of the law must prevail. And this is most welcome. [applause]
To our friends in ASEAN and around the world: Thank you for supporting my Government, my country and people when it truly mattered. I assure you that the Philippines will remain a responsible member of the international community [applause] and we will work with you to achieve our shared objectives.
But no mistake — but no mistake… But make no mistake rather, gone are the days when the Philippines decides and acts in the shadows of great powers. We will assert what is rightfully ours and fight for what is rightfully due to the Filipino people. [applause]
We do not have any SONA everyday. Now is as good as any other time to just let it out from sa puso mo.
This is why we sent back container vans of garbage because our country is not a dumpsite. [applause]
And the first country to do that, hindi ko alam kung bakit, ang Canada. And the container was there for three years because hindi alam ng port authorities kung anong gawain nila sa garbage. And I said, “Isauli mo. I want it done tomorrow. Those containers must be out of our country. ‘Pag hindi, kayong lahat, all of you in Customs, I’ll fire you.” That is a good ground for dismissing people for accepting the garbage. Kaya… May isa pa. Pero let me — let me end the story.
The Balangiga. We welcomed back the bells of Balangiga after many decades because a historic wrong needed to be corrected. [applause]
The deal was I would say I am in bad faith. Sigurado ‘yan. I will admit it. But this is the real story. The Americans — former soldiers, war veterans went to see me — I think that was in Aguinaldo — and some military men. And in no uncertain terms, they said that, “You have been invited by Trump to go to America. Have you decided to go there?” I said, “No.” “Why?” Sabi ko, “I do not like the way that you are treating my country.” “Why?” I said, “For one…” And there was the clamor now of Balangiga. “You return the bells of Balangiga.” That’s a war really sacred also to the soldiers. Then it is more sacred to us in addition to the religion — the Roman Catholic Filipinos — the Church.
Ang sabi nila, “Why don’t we make a deal?” Si Hogan, he’s an Ame — is he around? He’s a CIA agent. Sabi niya, “Isauli namin, pupunta ka?” Because I said earlier in my presidency, “There will never be a time that I will go to America.” Eh itong mga media mahilig mag-udyok eh. “Ah ganoon, bakit ka hindi pupunta? O arte mo lang ‘yan eh?” Sabi ko, “Then you watch me.” ‘Di gusto ninyong malaman. Sabi ko sa America, “Yes, I might consider going to America.”
So well then, sabi ko, “Work on it.” In just two months’ time, they told me that the ship carrying the Balangiga bells are on their way to deliver it to Quezon. [applause] You removed it, you put it back there, kayo mismo.
So tulong-tulong sila doon, nabalik na. And this Hogan said na, “Oh, so when are you going to go to America?” Sabi ko, “I do not have the time, but I will go there.” Noong malapit na, hindi na talaga ako pumunta. So… “Well, how about your promise?” Sabi ko, “Well, I lost time to do it. I cannot do it now.”
Pero talaga, in my mind, and the Americans might know it, I was — there was never in my mind a trip to America. Iyong Balangiga, sabi ko, you massacred one barangay — barrio noon — women and children and all pinatay nila lahat because that bell, Balangiga, was used to call the people for prayers, ganoon. Sa simbahan ‘yun eh.
So ‘yung ginawa nila, every time it is used, the Americans knew that it was — it has a great significance to the Filipinos, the Balangiga. After the massacre of one barangay, how many at the time, we would never know but it was, I said, isang barrio. Noon — barangay ngayon; barrio noon ‘yan eh. Barrio is an American word, the barrio. They also call the small places in Mexico barrio. The Americans borrowed it from the Spaniards, barrio.
So sabi ko, the blood — you really got it at the expense of the blood of Filipinos. I… “Do not hurry me up. If I go to America, it will be in my own time.” Pero actually, wala ako. I have not been to America for almost 10 years, 20 — 22 years. I have not visited America and I do not have any intention of visiting it anymore.
We called on the world to dismantle the heinous kafala system — ito ring isa — because the Filipino is no slave and to anyone anywhere [applause] and there is no room for modern day slavery. We helped start a new global civil rights movement for the migrant worker.
And, we asserted the arbitration ruling on the South China Sea — clearly and in no uncertain terms — bilaterally, [at] the ASEAN and finally, at the United Nations General Assembly. [applause]
And let me talk about [what] I said in the September of last year: the Arbitral Award is now part of the international law and beyond compromise and beyond the reach of the passing governments to dilute, to diminish or abandon. [applause]
That is the problem. Let me now — just to everybody — everybody in the Middle East, I would like to tell them that not only Filipinos but all human beings, the kafala has no place there because it’s a setup for slavery. Either you correct it or we will ask our workers, Filipino workers, to go home.
Sabi ko bahala na kung mahirap lang kami dito, okay lang. We will try our very best to make up for what they have lost, what they will lose in the process. But we will never allow them to be slaves.
But we need to do more. With our partners, we continue scaling [up] our maritime domain awareness [and] defense capabilities. Yet, we will not close our doors on diplomacy and détente. Because that is how disputes are settled and never by force.
Let me… Alam mo, I respect the opinion. You should be aware by now of how I talk, especially on matters of — crucial matters that involved the country. Ito bang arbitral ruling, I’ve said it in — I think in the latter part of the speech — I said that what’s your problem in the arbitral ruling?
America and some Filipinos — brilliant Filipinos, I would say — keep on pushing for something, which I really do not know. I have made a speech before the UN, naka-Zoom lang rin, nandito lang ako. Hindi ako pumunta doon. But in that speech, I laid down the bare, sabi ko — ng ating administrasyon.
Ano pa ang gusto ninyo? What will I do with a document that [does] not bind China because they were never a part of that arbitration? There was really no arbitration at all because it was only the Philippine side was heard. Well and good.
But ito ngayon that there is the arbitral ruling, you know, I do not want to insult these people pushing me for something more than what I can handle. At ano ang gusto nila, makipag-giyera? “Do something.” What do something? Do you want war against China? Well, I’ll tell you, even on the coast beach of Palawan, before you can take off, the missile of China would be there in about five or 10 minutes. It would be a massacre if I go and fight a war now. We are not yet a competent and able enemy of the other side.
So what I did I was just being nice to them. But for some people to say that I was helped by China in being President, these idiots, really. I will never, never do that. Hindi na bale ako hindi ma-Presidente, hindi ko talaga gagawain ‘yan. To be what? Receiving money from China to buy votes? They say that they helped.
Maybe in some Chinese communities, the gossip going around was that “support Duterte.” But the whole of the Chinese community in the Philippines went for me. Why? Kasi sa Davao noong mayor ako, ni minsan hindi ako tumatanggap maski Christmas gift.
Dito marami sa dito sa Maynila Presidente ako ngayon, maraming nagpapadala ng baril, kung anong ano diyan, sabi ko, “Isauli mo ‘yan”. Iyong mga relo. Eh itong aking relo, it’s IWC. This is only 300,000. But the Patek that has come [my] way, isinauli ko talaga. “Return it o ‘pag hindi, itapon mo sa Pasig sa harapan nila.”
Hindi — hindi ako tinulungan ng China. Nag-usap kami ng China civilly but after election. And after election, I was a good friend of President Xi, until now.
When the pandemic struck, the first country I called for help was China. President Xi, sabi ko, “Mr. President, we have no vaccination program here because we do not have the vaccines. We have not been able to invent one. We might have a hard time.” He said, “no, it’s okay. We’ll send you.”
And he send us — donated about 1,500,000 of vaccines. Ganoon, kaya nga sabi ko ako, lalo na kaming mga Bisaya, mabigat sa amin ‘yan, for us Visayans, iyong utang na loob mabigat talaga ‘yan. Hindi mo mabayaran ng ano pero ‘pag may utang na loob ako sa iyo, you can be sure that I will be your friend, a true friend and die for you.
Pero itong China magdayo, bakit ako magpakamatay diyan? Iyang sundalo ko ubusin ko? How can we fight China? Do we have the weapons? Do we have the — everything?
Now comes America, they say that if the attack is against the Philippines, they will defend. But they issued a statement that America does not meddle in conflicts involving the boundaries of other nations. And if America has to go to war, you would have to go to Congress to get — American Congress to get the authority to go to war.
That is why many presidents hindi na lang — it was a — just a mere — an error, a mistake — a malicious mistake. No president has ever been punished for attacking nations, getting into a fight with nothing. And if they come here, well, ang problema kasi nandito na ‘yung Balangiga. Isauli na lang natin uli. Maybe I’ll just return it ‘pag ito’y… It’s no big deal to us. Iyan ang bells, ring it until you die.
Fulfilling my promise to our coconut farmers and the Filipino people, my administration has worked with Congress to pass the Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act. [applause] We have returned also the Coco Levy funds to its true and rightful owners — our coconut farmers. [applause] The fund is now worth an estimated to be 75 billion [pesos], which will be utilized according to the plans and programs in the Coconut Farmers and Industry Development Plan for the direct benefit of the coconut farmers and the development of the coconut industry.
In our effort to ensure that food is within reach of every Filipino family, we worked for the passage of the Rice Tariffication Law in 2019 despite pushbacks. This resulted in the stabilization of rice supply and food prices. The proceeds from the tariffs enabled us to provide our farmers with modern machineries that increased their yield and sustaining the growth in agricultural production.
We also fulfilled our promise to [provide] free irrigation. That was the first promise I made some — in San Miguel, Bulacan when I was campaigning. The farmers invited me to go into the farms inside San Miguel, Bulacan. And we had a sort of a — well, a meeting, and the first thing that they were complaining about was the severity of the irrigation that they have to pay 5,000 every month — ah every year. Si sabi ko, “I will work on it.” Free Irrigation Service Act of 2018 is a product that now lowers the cost of agricultural production, especially for poor farmers.
We also worked to ensure that households have adequate supply of clean water. Potable and affordable water is more than a commodity. It is a vital public good. This is why I used my political capital to fight vested interests behind disadvantageous water service contracts [applause] that burdened consumers with unjustified water price increases. With the signing of [Revised Concession Agreements] with water concessionaires, consumers will be protected at least until 2037.
Ganito ‘yan eh, there is this concessionaire, dalawa. Ayaw ko na lang mag-ano — I will not mention names pero this is really what happened. Ang dalawang concessionaires, one in the south and the one is north, as the rich cartel dito sa Southeast Asia, ang kina-capture nila ang electricity pati tubig.
Dito sa tubig, in this contract with the water concessionaires, we made so many concessions that really, sabi ko, if you look at the contract and look at the Anti-Graft Law, talagang it’s all anti-graft. All of the sentences even the period and the question marks there.
Ah bakit? Sila walang problema sa tax because the people, consumers, will pay the taxes for them. Sila kung malugi, sabi nila hindi nila kasalanan and we can — I can think of it through not of their own fault, sabi doon bayaran natin sila malugi. We pay for the tax corporation nila at sila ang mag-decide kung i-increase nila o i-decrease nila ang water prices.
The regulators, itong mga regulators sa Pilipinas walang magawa and they acceded to the contract. It was really — I do not know how to put it. Kaya ako nag-pardon, ‘di ba nagmura ako? Sabi ko, biro mo kung malugi sila, babayaran pa natin. Tayo ang — ang corporate tax nila, tayo ang magbayad. And it’s a cartel, that service concessionaires are part of the cartel of Malaysia and Indonesia, and they form part of that mother corporation. Itong mga sa Pilipinas pati sa Malaysia, Indonesia they are just — kumbaga sa istorya, chapter lang ‘yan sila. It’s being controlled up by the…
Kaya sabi ko, “Wala ito.” I told them — I told Dominguez, “Tell them that I am no longer honoring the contract.” Mayroon pa doon payment of itong tax — water treatment plant to be constructed in the Harrison Plaza site. Iyon ang pinirmahan natin. So 1997 up to the present or up to the month that I blew my top, nagbabayad — ewan ko kung ngayon nagbabayad na. There’s a kuwan there sa water bills ninyo for enhancement of quality water. Ang ibig sabihin water treatment. And they were collecting since 1997 so until now how much of the Filipino’s money are with them for nothing, not even for a song?
Kaya ako, if there is something — hindi naman proud — but if there is something someday that my children will say: “What have you done for my country?” Sabihin ko, sila. Talagang inupakan ko sila. Sabi ko… [applause]
Ayaw ninyo? You do not want it? Well, okay, I will — I will just confiscate your system and call the military to operate it. I will exercise the eminent domain and expropriate all of your assets here kasi gagawin ko.
Iyon ang nangyari sa… So sinabi ko sa military, in one of our meetings immediately after that incident, I said, “If I do not make it to the finish line, kindly — look kindly at the Filipino at tanungin ninyo kung ano na ang nangyari sa kanila, iyang tubig na yan.”
Now, there is a new contract. I have not yet — I have to thoroughly digest it inside. I have to absorb it every word of it that the Filipino is protected. ‘Pag nandiyan na ‘yan, then I will sign. But I will not forget, I’m telling them the crime is there already and any Filipino who would want to go after you, can. Sabi ko, “I will not free you, I will not — there’s no way we’re —- in your… I will never allow that. Just make a new contract, just realize everyday that I can call you.”
Itong frequency, frequency ng ABS-CBN. Iyan ang pinaka-ideal kasi, you know, frequency is everywhere. But there is a spot, kung sa golf, a soft spot na maganda ‘yung… Wala akong problema sa ABS-CBN. They got my money, I’m not… They wanted to return it when the case blew up at they printed all the garbage including my daughter as a drug trafficker. Nilamon ko na lang lahat ‘yun because I never wanted to be — to appear vindictive.
But itong ano… They are cheating government by the billions in taxes. And they still want that frequency because ‘yan ang pinapag-awayan. No. I will give it to a Filipino na gustong maggawa nang tamang ano and pay. Because sa ABS-CBN, ‘yung even their equipment were imported tax-free kaya talaga ako hindi magpapayag. They still owe government billions. In the contract diyan sa nakalagay doon four hectares. So ang binabayaran nila four hectares sa property taxes. Supposed they are occupying 40 hectares, that complex there. Pero ginamit nila na papel ‘yung four hectares. Iyon lang ang binabayaran nila. Kung hindi ba naman… Kaya ko sila inaway. And, well…
Our micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs constitute 99.6 percent of our country’s businesses and are vital to economic activity, job creation, and poverty reduction. Ipinaramdam natin ang ating malasakit sa maliliit na negosyante sa pamamagitan ng Pondo sa Pagbabago at Pag-asenso Program. Since 2017, mayroon na tayo niyan. We have the program. The program has provided over 219,000 underprivileged microentrepreneurs with an alternative to the exploitative lending 5-6.
Iyan ang naka ano sa… You know what, maybe I have to go to — if need be, I have to go to India. Iyong 5-6 nila ng Turko, tinatawag nilang Turko, kung maghiram ka sa kanila ng 10,000, pahiramin ka niyang hindi pera 10,000. Six, seven thousand lang. And the others, mga refrigerator or the things that you do not even need in the house, bilhin mo sa kanila. Sala set, lahat na. That is part of… You do not want the furniture, the refrigerators, they won’t give you the…
Kaya ang Pilipino nabuktot. Alam mo ang buktot? Naging hunchback na lang sa trabaho, ganoon pa man. Kaya ako, sasabihin ko itong mga Turko, you better come up with a fair scheme if you want to go into business sa money lending, but not at that usu — usury a thousand times.
Likewise, to further support development of our micro and small businesses, we [instituted] radical reforms in the tax system to ease the taxation burden and increase the net income of lower wage earners and small businesses.
Thanks to Congress… [applause] Iyan hindi pa ninyo alam ha. Sabi ko lang…
Thanks to Congress and our revenue generating agencies, our tax reforms sustained our economic growth from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2019, which made the Philippines one of the fastest growing economies in Asia until the [applause] pandemic scourge.
Iyon talaga ang… Well, I don’t know what’s the plan of God. He sent us something which hit us right in the heart. We see so many — there’s no way of telling when this virus would disappear from the planet of the Earth. We can only pray to God to look into our direction and decide on what will happen to this planet he created.
However, tax laws are not always perfect and that is why every now and then, they have to be revisited to see if they are at pace with the changing times. Let us therefore continue to monitor the relevance and impact of our tax laws on individuals and private institutions to prevent serious damage on their financial health.
Going now to the social and health issues.
To unburden our people of the hefty costs of tertiary education, my administration worked with Congress to pass a landmark legislation that had remained unpassed for so many years: the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act in 2017 which provides free education to college students in state universities. [applause] Thank you, Congress.
We also passed the Universal Health Care Act in 2019. And to supplement this, I also signed into law the Malasakit Centers Act in 2019. [applause]
Kasi ganito ‘yan eh, ‘pag ang pobreng Pilipino nasa ospital, magpunta pa siya doon sa kung saan makahingi ng tulong. So ang ginawa, just like in Davao, ginawa namin ‘yung lahat na kailangan, ‘yung Internal Revenue kung nandiyan, business permit, diyan na lang sa isang lugar, medisina, kunin nila. Diyan mismo sa ospital, hindi na sila maglakad-lakad. And to me, that is one of the most — let me find the word — a poignant act of Congress and of the executive department. [applause]
[This] legislation, which was sponsored by Senator Bong Go [applause] — if you feel like standing up, you can, Senator, [applause] mas sikat ka pa sa guest speaker — [has] unburdened our people of the tedious process of going to various agencies and offices in order to avail of assistance from government. I am pleased to report that we have already established 130 Malasakit Centers across the country [applause] that has already helped millions of Filipinos in their hospitalization needs.
By establishing Malasakit Centers all over the country, we have actually levelled the playing field and provided our less fortunate countrymen the medical care they deserve. We will be establishing more. God willing, if we are still around.
Sa pagtatag ng Malasakit Center, hindi na po kailangan lumapit at humingi ng tulong sa iba’t ibang ahensya ng gobyerno. Ang gobyerno na ang lumalapit sa tao. [applause]
So let us talk about COVID. It’s mentioned everywhere in the speech, but what — what’s this g**d*** virus is?
I have to admit: back when I decided to answer your call and run for higher office, never, never did I imagine that my presidency would not only be judged by how I made good on my campaign promises in fighting illegal drugs, criminality, and corruption but by how well I led our nation dumake — during rather, the global pandemic.
Hindi na ako maka-pronounce mabuti baka mayroon na ako. [laughter and applause] May ambulansya ba diyan? Mukhang iba na ang… You know, I cannot pronounce the words. I hope this is not asymptomatic. [laughter]
Prior to the pandemic, we recorded our lowest debt-to-GDP ratio since 1986, the highest revenue effort since 1997, the highest credit rating in the country’s history — ‘yung sa bangko — because if your rating is high, it’s easy to borrow at maliit lang ang interest, that is the dynamics of a rating by Fitch — Fitch and [Standard] & Poor’s, mga ganoon — and the lowest rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty, well it’s still there. It is beyond dispute that our economic and governance fundamentals were robust when COVID-19 hit us.
I am sure that much can be said about the way we took on the daunting challenge of preserving lives while sustaining our momentum towards [our] developmental — dito na lang ako — goals. Naturally, we prioritized saving lives. Buhay muna bago ang lahat. Ibig sabihin, inuna natin ‘yung gastos — ‘yung pera natin sa pandemic. Kinuha ng — lahat ng anong mga budget. Si Dominguez ‘yan. Iyon ang ginamit ninyo sa Bayanihan 1 and 2. Doon natin kinuha ‘yung pera.
We moved quickly to safeguard the well-being of every Filipino through preventive and responsive health and safety measures, and broad and inclusive social amelioration programs or SAP. Thanks to the support of Congress, we launched the most extensive Social Protection Program in our country’s history, with the passage of Bayanihan 1 and Bayanihan 2. [applause]
Indeed, our national health system and resilience were tested to the hilt. Countless lessons were learned and continuous improvements put in place. Kahit anong krisis ay kayang malampasan, kung tunay na may malasakit at bayanihan. I agree.
At the early stages of the pandemic, our testing capacity was very limited. Recognizing the importance of conducting more tests to ensure early detection and timely isolation of confirmed COVID-19 cases, we ramped up our testing capacity. We now have more than 260 accredited laboratories nationwide which is capable of conducting at least 50,000 tests daily. All regions now can conduct their own COVID-19 tests.
To take care of mild and asymptomatic cases, we established over 9,000 temporary treatment and monitoring facilities across the country, with a total bed capacity of more than 140,000. Together with local governments and the private sector, we quickly established mega quarantine facilities that could accommodate more cases. Modular hospitals and quarantine facilities have also been established nationwide, especially in Metro Manila.
For our severe COVID cases, our tireless healthcare workers ensure that you are provided with the best care round the clock, based on latest developments and global best practices. Our health experts continue to actively participate in the search for safe and effective COVID-19 medicines.
With the help of Congress… Kita mo sa lahat. I never said, wala kang makikita, “that, I, [garbled] the key construction of a bridge that is nowhere to be found today,” iyong mga ganoon. Ako, sa inyo talaga.
With the help of Congress, we passed 13 measures that established new and improved the capacity of existing hospitals around the country to provide quality care and services to our people, especially amid the ongoing [COVID-19 pandemic]. [applause]
These include establishing new medical facilities in Mandaluyong City, Bacolod and Davao Occidental; increasing bed capacities of existing health facilities in Quezon City, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Palawan; [and] upgrading health facilities in that area to include Leyte.
Currently, we have received over 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. We expect [to receive at least] 36 million vaccines this month and in August. We have inoculated more than [17] million Filipinos [applause] — [around 11 million] of which have received their first dose. At least 17 million.
Well, I think the landscape — the health landscape of the country continues to improve as we, you know…
With the continuous [arrival] of COVID-19 vaccines, we are ready to boost further our daily vaccination rate. I am also encouraging our local government units to hasten their roll out and strengthen their inoculation program. San Juan City, for one, [will] have vaccinated 70 percent of their population in a month’s time. Saludo ako sa inyo [applause] at kay Mayor Zamora.
We cannot continue living in the shadow of this potent enemy, especially now that science and medicine has proven that it is possible to live with — if not entirely defeat — this virus. The health and safety protocols we put in place have proven effective in slowing the spread of the virus. But the best solution is still vaccination.
Am I too… Mataas na ba? Kasi kung mataas na, putulin na lang ninyo itong gumagalaw dito para sabihin ko, eh wala na man akong mabasa. ‘Pag matagal na… Those who want to go home, you raise your right hands. [laughter and applause] Pati si Monsignor baka itaas niya ang kamay niya eh. [laughter]
That is why I implore our countrymen who are now in the list of sectors to be inoculated to get vaccinated now. To those who received their first doses, please return for your second shot.
I also ask for patience to those who are next in line to receive their vaccine. More and more COVID-19 vaccines are arriving each week and you will soon have your turn.
Corollary to this, it is high time that clear, precise and uniform protocols and guidelines are issued in anticipation of the vaccination of more Filipinos and the steady reopening of our society.
You know, pagpasensyahan ninyo ako. I… I ask… I beg your kind indulgence. But I have to say this — to talk about something which would affect us all. Iyang… It seems that this government is too far away from the people. Iyong serbisyo talaga na totoo.
Noong isang araw, nakita ko, I don’t know what place was that. Ang mga tao nakapila and they say that they were there at 4 o’clock, lumalakas ‘yung ulan, sa payong lang sila. So nanonood ako sa report because I listen to the report every morning. Makukuha mo sa mga radio station ‘yan eh. So I was having breakfast. I was listening to the TV, at nakita ko ‘yung mga tao nakapila, lumalakas ang ulan. Sabi ko, “P***…” Eh doon sa breakfast table, nagmura ako. Pero dito good boy man ako kay may mga religious diyan baka…
I thus call on the National Task Force Against COVID-19 to see to it that this happens — I mean the protection. We have spent enormous amounts of resources to build our capacities to overcome this pandemic. We cannot afford more lockdowns lest our economy bleeds to the point of irreversible damage.
Balikan ko ‘yung ano, bakit mo papilahin? At sabi kasi doon libre lahat na, wala ng ano. So nagpuntahan ‘yung mga tao na nagpila kasi wala nang lista-lista pero sabi ng mga ito, alas kwatro pa sila. T*** i**.
Hindi lang ako puwedeng mag… Alam mo sa totoo lang, hindi naman ako nagyayabang. I am just an ordinary Filipino citizen. Just like you, I get hurt when people are nearly almost brutalized. Bakit hindi ka magkuha?
It’s rain time. Malakas ang monsoon — southwest monsoon. Dumadaan talaga sa Pilipinas. Gamitin mo ang utak mo. You should look for a gym at bigyan mo lahat ng tao ng number. Hanggang dito lang for this… Hanggang dito lang tayo, balik kayo itong bukas from 15 to 20, kayo na naman bukas.
Bigyan mo ng card. Prepare a card where you can — the marshal will go around the queuing na… Bakit mo…? Hindi ko maintindihan — there’s media — hindi ko maintindihan bakit gawain mo ‘yan sa Pilipino? Iyan ang tinatanong ko. Why do you have to do it to the Filipino? You can always — you know, maghanap ka ng… Tsk.
There is always a gymnasium. Mga eskwelahan walang klase ngayon. Bakit hindi mo gamitin doon? Bakit ka maghanap ng isang room…? T******** na… Kaya lang ako… Well, it is my — to my chagrin because I’m… Gusto kong lumabas. Itong PSG lang na ito ang…
You know, sabihin ko sa inyo, huwag kayong mag-presidente kay wala talagang… Sabihin ko maliit ang suweldo, wala ka. If you are not there really for the — mag-corrupt ka diyan, well, it would make you a billionaire overnight. But kung magtrabaho ka lang ng ganito…
Ako Presidente, gusto kong lumabas doon, sabihin ko, “Hoy, mga p***** i** ninyo, bakit ganito ‘to? Bakit ganoon kayo ka-estupido?” I mean, the Filipino does not deserve it even if they are not paying taxes. Because the theory of government is that all money belongs to the people and the money is there, it belongs to all of us and it should be used for public good. But what — what is the use of public good if you are not good and stupid? So ganoon ang mangyayari sa Pilipino.
I’m just letting off my… Kasi kung hindi lang talaga bawal, eh itong PSG hindi ako pinapalabas. Magsabi ako magpunta ako doon, “Sir, hindi puwede ‘yan, hindi puwede.” Kulong talaga ako. Mag-presidente ka, sa totoo lang you are a prisoner. You are brought here, kunwari ka pa de-chopper ka, de-guwardiya, tapos uwi ka doon sa bahay mo, tapos hindi ka na makalabas. Preso ka talaga.
“Tawagin mo ‘yung security, ‘yung gusto kong pumunta…” “Sir, hindi. Pasensya na.” Tapos pagalitan mo, sabihin, “Sir, eh ang authority namin does not come from you, it comes from a law so kami ang masunod.” Talagang… Sige ka pirma a bunch of papers. If you read it hanggang umaga trabaho ka. Suweldo mo ganoon lang. Just give me 219,000 tapos ganoon ang trabaho mag-isa ka. Buti’t ngayon kay nandito ‘yung asawa ko, nandito ‘yung anak ko. Nabubuhay ‘yung loob ko mag-uwi ako sa bahay ngayon. Tsk.
Looking forward, today is my last State of the Nation Address, but this is by no means my swan song. I shall never cease to implore Congress to pass vital and critical legislation as well as push the entire government to ensure nothing less than the full recovery and revitalization of our country.
But to do this, it is necessary for us to first overcome the crippling fear, anxiety and uncertainty that caused — that was caused by the threat of the COVID-19 virus.
Well, I really do not know what to do. I have to listen to the Task Force. This is a group of people volunteering to be a collective advisor that would give you the advice collectively, we put it that way, na sila ang mag-ano, magsabi. And we’re just waiting for the word.
I am referring to COVID D, Delta. It is rampaging now in Indonesia, Thailand, India, and many parts of Asia. And ang sabi doon sa — the Western medicine says that it is far more aggressive and far more dangerous and it can cause death easily than the COVID-19 original.
So this is as good as any other time to say it, if sees that it is really dangerous, you have to go back to lockdown. If there are many people in other parts of the world killing as many, then Delta, if ever it will spread — we have it here now — I hope it will not go any further. But if something wrong happens, I’ll have to be strict and I have now my word that there will be a… Just like what happened in the early days. Eh kung ganoon ang COVID D, saan tayo pupunta?
And if there is — it requires a new vaccine, we do not have it yet, I do not know what… Maybe we will just have to pray for salvation. Sabihin natin, “Diyos, we have done everything. But you know, this time we are really put hard on these things that happened.”
Rest assured that we will exert every effort to restore the lost livelihood of our affected countrymen. I have recently signed an Executive Order creating the task force that will shepherd the country’s National Employment Recovery Strategy.
The Task Force recently partnered with the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines to implement the Reform, Rebound, and Recover Program that aims to vaccinate qualified workers to fill in more than one million jobs.
These jobs will be created by different business associations in the fields of construction, information technology, BPO, and electronics. To our business associations, thank you for joining in our effort to bring back lost income opportunities for our workforce.
Another important component of our employment recovery strategy is the retooling of our workers to prepare them for better job opportunities. Since the start of community quarantines, over [1.2] million [individuals] availed of the TESDA’s free online training programs.
I am directing the National Employment Recovery Strategy Task Force, particularly TESDA, to ensure the upskilling of our workers and increase their employability. I expect the task force to work double time not only to recoup job losses, but more importantly to rehabilitate the economy and help our hardest hit sectors [recover].
Through the COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program, we released 988 million pesos worth of loans to over 14,000 enterprises [under] Bayanihan 1. [Under] Bayanihan 2, we released 2.9 billion pesos worth of loans to over 12,000 enterprises including our displaced OFWs and enterprises in the tourism sector to help them start or sustain their businesses amid the pandemic.
Along this line, I would like to renew my call to Congress to immediately pass the amendments of priority legislative measures such as the Foreign Investments Act, the Public Service Act, and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act. [applause]
Your applause went well ahead of its realization. You have to work on this guys and well I am sure that we can have a respite of this contagion in a — in your own little way.
Finally, I would like to reiterate my call for Congress again to pass legislation to establish a single agency that shall focus on and respond quickly to the needs and concerns of our OFWs. I pray that our next leaders and our future generations will not squander our natural resources and fight for the integrity of our environment, in a manner fiercer and more effective than my administration had ever done.
The pandemic has taken so much from us as a nation but like [all] other adversities that tested us time and again, it can never take [away] our courage and resilience. And the spirit of Bayanihan 1 — rather, bayanihan and the value of malasakit are now indelible in us Filipinos. We shall use these gifts to forge ahead towards a better normal.
As we come to a point where the risk of COVID-19 transmission can, to a certain extent, be managed, I am hopeful that we shall be united in forging ahead towards bringing the country back to its robust growth path.
Let me end by adding these particular statements. Well, on learning — education and learning.
Despite our inability to conduct face-to-face classes during this pandemic, we remain determined to deliver quality and accessible education to all. The creation of the Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan enabled the uninterrupted learning of students in the basic education sector while ensuring their and teachers’ health, safety, and well-being.
While the pandemic has demonstrated the readiness, resourcefulness and capability of government to serve the Filipino people through the use of ICT and digital services, it has also shown its inherent deficiencies and weaknesses. As such I ask Congress to pass an E-Governance Act that will set up the transition of government processes to the digital age.
I would like to add something on the protection of our overseas Filipinos.
I also ask Congress to pass a law creating the Department of Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos [applause] — kailangan po ito because they are suffering not on — they suffered not only yesterday but they are still suffering now with so many inadequacies, in both our government response including the monetary assistance — to ensure that there is a department that is solely focused on addressing the needs and taking care of the welfare of our countrymen abroad.
Before I end, let me also touch on the environmental protection.
It has also been 13 years since the Supreme Court, through a mandamus, ordered the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. Unfortunately, no immediate substantial action to comply with the Supreme Court’s order was undertaken until 2019, when this administration started its long overdue rehabilitation.
As of May [2021], all illegally operating open dumpsites surrounding Manila Bay have been shut down, while 151 out of 187 LGUs surrounding the Bay now have access to sanitary landfills.
Establishments have been forced to comply with environmental laws and ordinances while those who did not have been closed down.
As a result, pollutants have been largely reduced and coliform levels — also reduced to its barest maximum — are now on its lowest levels in years if not decades. I urge the DENR to sustain its efforts and continue working with our LGUs to restore Manila Bay to its former glory. [applause]
You know, just one little thing before we end. Iyong pag-ano sa Manila Bay, well, there is a corner where all the garbage con — by current — by action of the current, nandito marami sa likod ng Luneta.
Ginawa natin ‘yan at nilagay natin itong ‘yung puting bato na which is, well, scattered into small pieces. Eh nawawala minsan ‘yan because of the waves.
So every now and then, we still have to replenish because we cannot change the nature of our shores. That is how it is. It is not a permanent fixture there, [dolomite]. It is there from the mountains and we break it down and bring it to the sea.
But that would occupy that place irrespective of there is a high tide or low tide. Nakakatulong ‘yan at nawawala ‘yan. And the only way to do it is to replenish it until we can think of a good alternative of how we can process the whole thing back to its normalcy. If there was really normalcy at the time or at any other time in the past.
On the resilience. Again, dinagdag ko na lang ito. Time is good and as any other time again to ask you.
In line with this, we hope to pursue the creation of public entities dedicated to managing emerging and re-emerging diseases. I thus fervently ask Congress to enact a law creating the Center for Disease Prevention and Control and the Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines.
We must… [applause] Maski gaano natin kahirap, however poor we are I think that the Filipinos, given the proper support and the things there, the equipment that they have to use, we can — I am sure that the Filipino brain can also process or make vaccines in the future. [applause]
Tapos na po ‘yan, ma’am. I ask Congress to pass the — ‘yan — Disaster Resilience Act that will create the Department of Disaster Resilience.
Let us also — pagkatapos nito, ma’am, ikaw ‘yung unang tao na mag-congratulate sa akin ha. Kaya ako nagka-utal-utal dito eh dahil sa iyo.
Let us also pass the law implementing the Fire Protection Modernization Program to bolster the readiness of our firefighters and ensure their ability to respond to fires and disasters. Related to this… [applause] Importante ‘yang trabaho ng bumbero maniwala kayo. They must also be there during any disaster happening.
Let us also push for the Mandatory Establishment of Evacuation Centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country, which shall provide the basic needs and assistance to all evacuees during times of emergency.
Now, there is now the conclusion. Sabi, “Hay, salamat.” [laughter] Sabi, ” P*****g Duterte ‘to oh.”
The lights go out for this administration eleven months from now. The work that we started and expected to finish within the constitutional time frame of six years has been stalled. Much was hoped for. But we need not despair. Desperation is a feeling alien to the resilient Filipino.
A peaceful and prosperous Philippines is no longer a distant dream but one that is within our grasp if our future Filipinos would also do it — if would continue the — if they would continue and would seize the opportunity to work together.
Malaki ang pasasalamat ng mga kababayan natin at lagi nilang sinasabi na mas panatag ang loob nila ngayon. Hindi na nababahala ang mga magulang na lumalabas ang mga anak nila at naglalakad sa gabi. [applause]
I will not elaborate on anything. You can draw your conclusion. Alam mo, when the Filipino, a father, a mother, or a child, naglalakad sa gabi at siya ay — kagaya ng iba, even in America, you go into the inner cities of L.A. and New York, you — sa Washington D.C., there’s a corner there, there’s a — do not go there because you will not come out alive. Ganoon, kung hindi maglakad na sila puro takot na lang ang nasa loob nila ma-holdup sa jeep tapos pati ‘yung taga Ombudsman na buntis patay pa pati ‘yung bata sa loob ng tiyan.
Just to get the money to buy shabu because when the monkey is riding on your back, iyong katawan mo hindi mo na maano, that is why you need to higop — sip, kailangan mo maghigop at kailangan mo pumatay ‘pag wala kang pera. Hindi naman talagang papatay, maybe not. The mind is not ready for that but in the struggle, you put up a struggle if you are the owner of the money, eh talagang papatayin ka ‘pag hindi mo ibigay.
Iyan ang ayaw ko kaya noong na-mayor ako sa Davao, ganito, mga p***** i** — mga p****** i** niyo, umalis kayo sa daan, ‘yung daan, ‘yung public transportation is for public good. Huwag mo silang takutin na magkanto ‘pag uwi, nandiyan nag-iinuman sa — iyan ang hilig ng Pilipinong — mag-inuman. Hindi mo malaman ang mga nag-uwi na babae, they have to take another route that would be longer because nandiyan mga istambay.
So the streets are unsafe, hino-holdup, pinapatay. Sabi ko doon sa Davao — sa Davao na lang, huwag na lang ako dito sa Maynila, hindi naman talaga ako nakikialam dito pero alam nila, alam ng pulis kung ano ang gusto ko.
Mag-prangkahan tayo. Sabi ko sa pulis, “Isauli mo ‘yan.” The roads, the highways are for law-abiding citizens of this country. Iyong mga kriminal, ‘yung mga — well, the dregs of society, huwag ninyong gamitin ‘yang mga daan, hindi para sa inyo ‘yan. And I will see to it that you are not there, be sure that when I pass by, I do not see you. Because if I see you, I will dance with you. Isauli ko.
Kaya ngayon medyo hindi naman talaga ano but ‘yung mga sales girl ng mga — mga shopping center eh panatag na ang loob nila at least ang chances of being mugged, murdered, and raped. Iyan ang ayaw ko. ‘Pag malayo nakahigop na, kunin ‘yung pera, hilain doon sa medyo maliit na mga grassy portion and rape at papatayin. Iyan ang hindi ko matanggap. Just like ‘yang Pilipino sabi ko…
I may be — I may be just a little bit crazier than the others but that is what I am. Ayaw ko ‘yung — lalo na mag — mag-shabu ka tapos mag-pasyal ka kung ano wala kang makuhang pera, aakyat ka ng bahay. Just like that bank teller, it was raining so hard just like the rains that we had experienced. It was pouring almost cats and [dogs], ang lakas talaga nang bagsak ng ulan. She went home to knock the door and pump the door loud but ang parents nilang matanda — matanda na ‘yung parents, hindi nakarinig.
So anong ginawa nitong ma — mga sa construction workers? Sabi ko diyan nga ako galit sa droga eh. Nabibili nila mura. It’s 200, 300, susuyupin nila at ‘pag nakasuyop ng droga ‘yan, maghanap ng alcohol ‘yan. Sigurado ‘yan. ‘Pag tama ng alcohol pati ‘yung ano ng droga it shrinks the brain, ‘yon. Iyong babae dinampot — she was just picked up and brought to the construction site near the house tapos ni-rape doon, pinatay, sinunog pa.
Iyan ang hindi ko talaga maintindihan. I cannot reco… Iyong bata na 3-year-old rape-in mo. Ang problema nito, ang nakikita nila ang patay na mga kriminal. Well, how about the victims on the other side? Bakit hindi ninyo tingnan and see what these criminals have done to our children, to our wives, and daughters?
May listahan kayo p**… Ang listahan ninyo doon sa namatay hindi ba kayo maligaya niyan wala ng kriminal? Pero ‘pag tingin mo dito ilan ang patay na inosente? Pati pulis ko at sundalo namamatay diyan baka akala ninyo kriminal lang. So that is my lamentations and I just want you to hear.
In my five years in office, we made real change in governance through the reforms we pursued. However, for this governance — must be sustained and broadened. We need to make…
I’m not — I’m just getting my air. Naghihingal ako. Baka — baka dito ako mamatay pagka-Presidente. Iba na ang pitik ng ano ko ngayon ng kasing-kasing ko. Kasing-kasing is puso.
[We need] to make every public servant responsive to the needs of the people and enjoin every Filipino to assert their right to demand malasakit from their leaders until everyone lives with dignity — well-fed, educated, healthy, secure, disciplined, and empowered — to contribute to national development.
I will not be forever be President. But ang kulang sa Pilipino is assertiveness. ‘Pag may — mayroon kayong transaction at hingian kayo, ang sabi ko sa inyo, ito ang payo ko, murahin mo, sabihin mo, “P***** i** ka, nagtatrabaho kayo at kami dito. We are following papers and you are sitting on your a** on it.”
Kaya dito, sabi ko, makinig kayong lahat ng Pilipino tutal last SONA ko na ito, ‘pag may mag-follow up kayo, permit, clearance, at maghingi ng pera, murahin ninyo. Sabihin ninyo, “’Yan, sabi ni Duterte sampalin ko kayo kasi ako nagbabayad ng buwis, bakit ginaganito ninyo?”
And to the mga Pilipino, hindi naman lahat, tayong nagtatrabaho sa gobyerno, I mean it takes you one month to process a paper, it takes you — tapos pabalik-balik ‘yung tao. ‘Pag ang tao bumabalik, dalawa, isa, tatlo, then there is corruption there. Murahin mo, at kung maaari, pahiramin kita ng pangkulam para kulamin mo.
Ganoon talaga. I’m just warning everybody, there’s still one year to go. In Davao, three days. Lagyan mo ng papel, “Bumalik ka dito at this hour on Thursday.” At pagka naipakita mo ‘yung papel, hanapin niyo ‘yung ibibigay. Iyan ang gamitin ninyo, for all the local governments also.
In my Cabinet, it’s 30 days, walang extension. All. Sabi ko, you reduce the signing authority from six, seven, to only one or two. Hindi naman pala kailangan… [applause] Hindi kailangan magpirma lahat ng empleyado diyan, one or two. Iyong iba mag-process lang.
But if you cannot process it also in so many days, in Davao, if you sub — if it is a clearance, which is long overdue, hindi mo na puwedeng ibigay doon sa tao. Ibigay mo sa akin at tanungin kita, “… mo, bakit inabot ka ng ganito?” Wala — there is no other conclusion. Corruption ‘yan.
Kagaya… What is true in Davao is true for the entire Philippines. Mabuti’t na rin ‘yan nakapagsalita ako ng freely with you tutal last ko naman na itong SONA. Mabuti ‘yang malaman ng tao na ganoon ang ginagawa nila. It’s not there. Hindi man — hindi man nila lalagay ‘yang mga ganoon na, wala mang mura diyan. Be careful this is…
We need to fight to subdue narrow vested interests and ensure that our gains will [redound] to the benefit of the greater number of Filipinos, especially those who have the least in life.
We have laid down the groundwork and are continuing to push for landmark reforms and key accomplishments up to the last days of my term. I have full confidence that the Filipino spirit…
Pati ako nagmamadali na. Eh naiihi na kanina pa eh. [laughter and applause] It’s a natural human biology so what’s the big deal? Bakit kayo magpakpak kung napaihi na ako? [laughter and applause] Sabagay, alam ko rin, nahihiya kayong magtindig. Puno ang pila nito pagdating sa CR mamaya. [laughter]
I have full confidence that the Filipino spirit will persevere and triumph. Together, let us rise as a nation. Thank you. [applause]

HIS EXCELLENCY FERDINAND R. MARCOS JR.
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 25, 2022]
 
Vice President Sara Zimmerman Duterte; Former Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Rodrigo Roa Duterte; Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the honorable Justices of the Supreme Court; the Apostolic Nuncio Most Reverend Charles John Brown and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; the honorable members of the Cabinet; our First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos and our children [applause]; distinguished guests; ang mga minamahal kong mga kababayan; ladies and gentlemen; magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat.
I come before you today to address you, as it is my duty as President of the Republic.
We live in difficult times brought about by some forces of our own making, but certainly, also by forces that are beyond our control.
But we have, and we will continue to find solutions.
And these are some of them.
In terms of the economy, we will implement a sound fiscal management.
Tax administration reforms will be in place to increase revenue collection.
Expenditure priorities will be realigned, and spending efficiency will be improved to immediately address the economic scarring arising from the effects of COVID-19, and also to prepare for future shocks.
Productivity-enhancing investments will be promoted.
Our country must become an investment destination, capitalizing on the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Law and the economic liberalization laws such as the Public Service Act and the Foreign Investments Act.
Ecozones will be fully supported to bring in strategic industries such as those engaged in high-tech manufacturing, health and medical care, and all emerging technologies.
This is also seen to facilitate economic growth outside of Metro Manila.
Our tax system will be adjusted in order to catch up with the rapid developments of the digital economy, including the imposition of value-added tax on digital service providers.
The initial revenue impact will be around Php 11.7 billion in 2023 alone.
Tax compliance procedures will be simplified to promote ease of paying taxes.
We will pursue measures to determine possible undervaluation and/or trade misinvoicing of imported goods.
Through information and communications technology, the Bureau of Customs will promote streamlined processes.
Disbursements for 2022 to 2023 will be maintained at above 20 percent of gross domestic product or Php 4.955 trillion and Php 5.086 trillion, respectively, to ensure continuous implementation of priority programs.
Disbursement will further increase over the medium-term from Php 5.402 trillion or 20.7 percent of our GDP in 2024 to Php 7.712 trillion or 20.6 percent of GDP in 2028.
The Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy of this administration seeks to attain short-term macro-fiscal stability while remaining supportive of the country’s economic recovery and to promote medium-term fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, and more importantly, fiscal policy aims to bring together the National Government’s resources so that these are mobilized and utilized in order to gain the maximum benefit and the high multiplier effects for our economy.
Measurable medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal objectives include the following headline numbers. These are based on forecasts that are consistent with the guiding principles of coherence of strategies, policy discipline and fiscal sustainability.

6.5 to 7.5% real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2022; 6.5 to 8% real GDP growth annually between 2023 to 2028
9% or single-digit poverty rate by 2028
3% National Government deficit to GDP ratio by 2028
Less than 60% National Government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2025
At least 4,256 USD income (GNI) per capita and the attainment of upper middle-income status by 2024

The aforementioned headline goals summarize the objectives of this Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFF) being submitted to Congress, for its adoption and concurrence through a Concurrent Resolution by the Senate and House of Representatives.
Once adopted, the MTFF will become an anchor for the annual spending and financing plan of the National Government and Congress when preparing the annual budget and undertaking related appropriation activities. It is therefore a forward-looking document that extends beyond the traditional three-year horizon to reach six (6) years, coinciding with the six-year coverage of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023 to 2028.
The MTFF also promotes transparency and credible commitment to pursue the indicated socio-macroeconomic goals that optimize the government budget.
Medium-term growth targets and the assumptions regarding key macroeconomic variables underpin the medium-term fiscal plan. The recent past and the COVID-19 pandemic has beset the macroeconomic environment with challenges and a series of external shocks. Inflation has accelerated in recent months due largely to significant increases in international prices of oil and other key commodities.
Still, the economic growth momentum remains firm as demonstrated by the strong 2022 first quarter GDP growth at 8.3 percent. However, the recovery process from the impact of the pandemic is still on-going amid elevated uncertainty in the international economic environment. Revisions in the macro-economic assumptions incorporate these challenges and most recent economic developments, leading to upward adjustments in the following:

Inflation rate for 2022 to 2023;
Foreign exchange rate for 2023 to 2025; and
Goods and services imports growth for 2022

The economy is expected to grow by 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year as we continue to reopen the economy while considering the recent external developments.
In the first quarter alone, GDP saw an increase in household consumption and private investments, along with a robust manufacturing industry, high vaccination rate, improved healthcare capacity, and an upward trend in tourism and employment. This is expected to continue for the rest of the year. This strong economic growth is projected to be sustained and expanded further to 6.5 to 8 percent from 2023 until 2028.
The average inflation for 2022 is projected to range from 4.5 to 5.5 percent, following the uptick in fuel and food prices as a result of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the disrupted supply chains.
It is slightly adjusted to 2.5 to 4.5 percent in 2023, and is seen to return to the target range of 2.0 to 4.0 percent by 2024 until 2028.
Dubai crude oil price is expected to settle at 90 to 110 USD per barrel in 2022, 80 to 100 USD per barrel in 2023, and 70 to 90 USD per barrel from 2024 onwards as oil supply is expected to catch up and stabilize over the medium-term.
The Philippine peso is projected to average between 51 to 53 PhP per US dollar in 2022 and 51 to 55 PhP per US dollar from 2023 onwards due to aggressive monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, market aversion amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and again, increased global oil prices.
Lastly, exports of goods are expected to grow by 7 percent in 2022, and 6 percent from 2023 to 2028.
On the other hand, imports of goods are projected to grow by 18 percent in 2022, 6 percent in 2023, and 8 percent from 2024 to 2028.
I have instructed the NEDA to coordinate with other agencies and work on the Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028 and to submit to me the complete blueprint and progress of its implementation not later than year-end.
One of the main drivers of our push for growth and employment will be in the agricultural sector.
With regard to food supply, we are confronted by a two-pronged problem: that which will hit us in the short term and that which will hit us in the long term.
Tayo ay nahaharap sa mga problemang kagyat nating mararamdaman at mga hamong pang-matagalan.
Ang mga suliraning agarang mararamdaman ng ating mga kababayan ay ang posibilidad ng tuloy-tuloy na pagsipa ng presyo ng pagkain at kakulangan sa suplay ng ating pagkain.
Upang masuportahan ang mga mamimili para mapanatili ang kanilang purchasing power o kapangyarihan sa pagbili, isinapinal ng Department of Agriculture ang planong taasan ang produksyon sa susunod na panahon ng pagtatanim o planting season, sa pamamagitan ng tulong pinansiyal at teknikal.
Magbibigay tayo ng pautang, habang mas ilalapit natin sa sektor ng agrikultura ang hindi gaanong mahal na farm inputs na bibilhin na ng bulto ng gobyerno.
Kabilang dito ang abono, pestisidyo, mga punla, feeds, fuel subsidy at ayuda para sa mga karapat-dapat na benipisyaryo.
Para sa pang-matagalang solusyon: itataas natin ang produksyon ng mga kalakal at produktong pang-agrikultura. At para magawa ito, pagtitibayin natin ang tinatawag na value chain na nagsisimula sa mga magsasaka hanggang sa mga namimili.
May mga bahagi ng value chain na sa ngayon ay kanya-kanya ang operasyon. Pagtibayin natin ang koordinasyon ng iba’t ibang bahagi nito.
Ang pagsasaliksik para sa mga makabagong paraan ng pagtatanim at pag-aalaga ng hayop ay masusing gagabayan ng Department of Agriculture.
Ang produksyon ng farm inputs o mga kakailanganin ng mga magsasaka sa pagpapalago ng kanilang sakahan ay ating iaayon sa mga hamong dala ng climate change at global warming.
Mahigpit na pagsusuri ang gagawin ng ating mga eksperto tungo dito.
Ang mga pautang at financial assistance sa mga magbubukid at mangingisda ay magiging institusyon at patakaran ng aking administrasyon. [applause]
Ipaprayoridad natin ang modernisasyon ng mga sakahan sa pamamagitan ng mga makabagong teknolohiya para sa ating mga magsasaka. Ating palalawakin ang mga palaisdaan, babuyan at manukan. Lahat ng ito, gagamitan ng siyensya para tumaas ang produksyong agrikultural. [applause]
Maging ang post-production at processing ay susuportahan ng pamahalaan.
Gagawa tayo ng national network ng farm-to-market roads upang mas mabilis na mailakbay ng mga magsasaka ang kanilang mga produkto sa mga pamilihan.
At gagawa tayo ng mga paraan upang maramdaman ng mga mamimili ang pagluluwag ng presyo ng mga produktong pagkain sa kayang halaga, gaya ng muling pagbubuhay ng mga Kadiwa Centers.
Hindi ito magagawa sa isang araw, hindi magagawa sa isang buwan, o isang taon lamang.
Ngunit kailangan na natin simulan NGAYON. [applause]
Ang agrarian reform program ay dapat magpatuloy.
Agrarian reform is not only about acquisition, but also about support services and distribution.
To assist this, I intend to issue an executive order to impose a one-year moratorium on the payment of land amortization and interest payments. [applause]
This is included in Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.
A moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy. [applause]
The civil society organizations also support this because it will unburden the farmers of their dues and be able to focus on improving farm productivity.
Congress must also pass a law that will emancipate the agrarian reform beneficiaries from the agrarian reform debt burden, thereby amending Section 26 of Republic Act 6657.
IN THIS LAW, THE LOANS OF AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES WITH UNPAID AMORTIZATION AND INTEREST SHALL BE CONDONED. [applause]
Layunin ng batas na ito ay burahin ang hindi mabayarang utang ng ating mga magsasaka na benipisyaryo ng agrarian reform.
Agrarian reform beneficiaries who are still to receive their awarded land under the comprehensive agrarian reform program shall receive it without any obligation to pay any amortization. [applause]
The condonation of the existing agrarian reform loan will cover the amount of 58.125 billion pesos benefiting 654,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries and involving a total of 1.18 million hectares of awarded lands. [applause]
Executive Order No. 75, Series of 2019 requires that all government agencies, bureaus, departments and instrumentalities to turn over agricultural lands to qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries.
At present we have a total of 52,000 hectares of unused agricultural lands of the government which shall now be used for distribution to the following sectors in accordance with Section 40 of the Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, thus:

Landless war veterans
Landless surviving spouse and orphans of war veterans
Landless retirees of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police

Agricultural lands acquired under this program will be given to graduates of college degrees in agriculture who are landless. [applause]
The call of the times is for the infusion of fresh and new blood in the agricultural sector. We need a new breed of farmers equipped with modern agricultural technology able to engage in sustained scientific farming that will not only increase farm yields, but also resilience in the face of climate change. [applause]
They say that each brand has a story. As for the Filipino brand, ours is deeply rooted in our rich cultural heritage and the tourism sector plays an invaluable role in the promotion of the Filipino brand.
Tourism is not only an important economic development tool but the abundance of opportunities that the sector creates in terms of regular employment and even job creation at the grassroots level is undeniable.
To boost our tourism industry, we will first and foremost make basic developments such as road improvements for easier access to tourism spots. We will also upgrade our airports and create more international airports [applause] to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.
We will also make it more convenient for travelers to go around the country, even to remote areas to help promote undiscovered tourist spots. This program will be led by the Department of Tourism, together with the Department of Public Works and Highways. [applause]
To foster the Filipino brand is to spark our sense of pride and reaffirm our strong sense of identity. It is time to welcome the rest of the world with an enhanced Filipino brand that is unique, attractive, and creative.
The creativity of the Filipino is truly world-class. We excel in arts and culture, new media, live events — avenues which generate primary and downstream jobs for our creative and talented countrymen. Unfortunately, ang mga hanapbuhay na ito ang unang pinadapa ng pandemya at ang pinakahuli namang makakabalik sa normal.
The creative industry likewise faces many challenges including workplace conditions, working hours, intellectual property rights, and the welfare of our beloved freelancers who were left vulnerable during the height of the pandemic.
We require an institutionalized creative industry that will advance the interests of its stakeholders — sila na nagbibigay ng kaluluwa at [pagkakilanlan] sa ating pagka-Pilipino. Protektahan natin sila. [applause]
The Department of Social Welfare and Development has a large part to play in all of this.
Magpapatuloy ang ating pagkalinga sa ating mga kababayan na lubos na nangangailangan.
Hindi po natin sila pababayaan.
Mangunguna sa pag-aagapay sa kanila ang Department of Social Welfare and Development.
Utos ko sa DSWD ang mabilis na pagtugon sa pangangailangan ng mga biktima ng kalamidad at mga iba’t ibang krisis.
Ang mga field office nila ay inatasan na maagang maglagak ng family food packs at non-food essentials sa mga LGU, bago pa man manalasa ang anumang kalamidad.
Magdadagdag tayo ng mga operations center, warehouse at imbakan ng relief goods, lalo na sa mga malalayong lugar na mahirap marating.
Titiyakin natin na maayos ang koordinasyon ng DSWD at Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development ng sa ganun, madali ang pagpapatupad ng Emergency Shelter Assistance program para sa mga biktima ng kahit anong kalamidad. [applause]
Pagtitibayin pa natin ang komprehensibong programang ‘Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations’ o ang ating tinatawag na AICS, para maiparating ang tulong sa mas maraming biktima. [applause]
Hindi natin papahirapan ang mga biktima ng krisis na dudulog sa ahensiya — gagawin nating simple ang proseso ng paghingi at pagpaparating ng tulong. Dahil hindi naman dapat dinadagdagan pa ang hirap na nararanasan ng ating mga mamamayan.
Upang matiyak na mapupunta sa kwalipikadong mga pamilya ang tulong ng pamahalaan sa pamamagitan ng 4Ps o Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, titiyakin natin na malilinis ang listahan ng benipisyaryo. [applause]
Higit na sa isang milyong pangalan na ang naka-graduate na sa listahan. At nagagalak akong mabatid na sila ay nakakatayo na sa kanilang sariling paa.
Kaugnay nito ay inutusan ko ang DSWD na pag-ibayuhin pa ang pagrepaso ng listahan upang maitutok ang pamimigay ng sapat na ayuda sa mga lubos na nangangailangang pamilya.
Magpapatuloy ang supplemental feeding program para sa mga bata sa Child Development Centers at Supervised Neighborhood Play, at lalo pa nating palalawakin sa taong 2023. [applause]
Hindi rin natin nakakalimutan ang mga solo parents at mga nanay na nahiwalay sa kanilang mga mister dahil sa karahasan.
Pagtitibayin natin ang programa sa Violence Against Women and Their Children, kabilang na ang counselling para sa mga biktima, katuwang ang ating mga LGU.
Tiyakin natin na sapat ang pondo sa halos pitumpong residential care centers at pitong non-residential care centers para sa vulnerable sectors at persons with disabilities na sumisilong dito.
Sa ating sitwasyon ng pangkalusugan, nariyan pa rin ang banta ng COVID-19, lalo’t may mga nadidiskubreng bagong variants ng coronavirus. Pero hindi na natin kakayanin ang isa pang lockdown. Wala na tayong gagawing lockdown. [applause]
Dapat nating balansehin nang maayos ang kalusugan at kapakanan ng ating mga mamamayan sa isang banda, at ang ekonomiya naman sa kabilang banda.
Nakikipagtulungan ang iba’t ibang ahensya ng pamahalaan sa pag-monitor sa mga COVID-19 hospital admission upang makatiyak tayo na may sapat na kapasidad ang ating health care system at maiwasan ang pagsipa ng bilang ng nagkakasakit.
Patuloy din ang ating vaccine booster rollout para sa ating pangkalahatang depensa. [applause]
Sa ganitong paraan, kahit pa tumaas muli ang bilang ng mga COVID cases, mananatiling mababa ang bilang ng mga maospital at bilang ng mga namamatay.
Sa pamamagitan nito, unti-unti rin tayong masasanay na nariyan ang virus pero hindi na seryoso ang banta sa ating buhay.
Iaayon natin ang ating mga health protocols sa kung ano ang ating pangangailangan sa paglipas ng panahon at lalo pang iibayuhin ang kooperasyon kasama ang pribadong sektor upang tumaas pa ang kumpyansa ng mga mamumuhunan, nang sa gayon ay bumalik na tayo sa “full capacity” lalong-lalo na ang ating mga negosyo. [applause]
Pagbubutihin pa natin ang pagpapakalat ng tamang impormasyon ukol sa COVID, kasama ang kahalagahan ng bakuna.
Mananatili muna sa ngayon ang ating Alert Level System natin. Pinapag-aralan natin ang ibang paraan ng klasipikasyon upang mas babagay sa kasalukuyang sitwasyon lalong-lalo na sa pagbabago ng COVID.
Sa pakikipagtulungan ng Kongreso, itatatag natin ang ating sariling Center for Disease Control and Prevention at ang isang vaccine institute. [applause]
Magtatayo tayo ng dagdag na mga health center at ospital.
But beyond the issues that the pandemic has brought, the need for a stronger health care system is self-evident. We must bring medical services to the people and not wait for them to come to our hospitals and health care centers. [applause]
Napakinabangan natin nang husto ang malalaking specialty hospitals gaya ng Heart Center, Lung Center, Children’s Hospital at National Kidney and Transplant Institute. Kaya maliwanag na na hindi lang dapat dito sa National Capital Region, kundi maging sa ibang parte ng bansa… [applause and cheers] Maliwanag na hindi lamang dapat dito lamang sa National Capital Region kundi maging sa ibang parte ng bansa kailangan magdagdag ng ganitong uri ng mga pagamutan. [applause]
Bukod dito, upang mailapit natin ang health care system sa taumbayan nang hindi sila kailangang pumunta sa sentro ng kanilang bayan, lalawigan o region, ay maglalagay tayo ng mga clinic, mga RHU na pupuntahan ng mga doktor, nurse, midwife, medtech, isang beses, dalawang beses sa isang linggo — nang sa gayon, magiging mas madali sa may karamdaman na magpapagamot nang hindi na kailangang magbiyahe nang malayo. [applause]
One of the cornerstones of a strong healthcare system is the provision of competent and efficient medical professionals. We will exert all efforts to improve the welfare of our doctors, our nurses, and other medical frontliners. [applause]
Dapat din tayong magkaroon ng sapat na suplay ng gamot na kinakailangan sa pang-araw-araw ng ating mga mamamayan.
Sinimulan ko na ang pakikipag-usap sa mga kumpanya ng gamot dito sa Pilipinas at sa ibang bansa. Hinihikayat natin na buksan nila ang merkado upang bumaba ang presyo ng gamot. [applause]
Halimbawa, kung mas marami ang mas murang generic o hindi branded na gamot sa merkado, mas bababa rin ang presyo dahil sa kumpetisyon.
Ang Department of Trade and Industry ay nakikipag-usap sa mga interesadong manufacturer ng generic drugs na papasok sa ating bansa. [applause]
Inuutusan ko naman ang Philippine Competition Commission na pantay-pantay dapat at walang kartel sa hanay ng mga pharmaceutical companies. [applause and cheers] Dahil kapag bukas ang merkado, bababa ang presyo ng gamot para mapakinabangan ng ating mga mamamayan.
This is one of the hard lessons that we learned when the pandemic struck, and therefore, we must act on that shortcoming. [applause]
In the educational sector, I believe it is time for our children to return to full face-to-face classes once again. [applause]
The Department of Education, led by our highly able Vice President Sara Duterte, [applause] is now preparing for its implementation in the upcoming school year, with utmost consideration for the safety of students, as we are still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We must ensure that our classrooms are safe for teachers, for students, and the entire academic community when they return to face-to-face classes.
We continue to encourage everyone to get their booster shots in preparation for the resumption of in-person classes. [applause]
This is one of the reasons I have directed the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to undertake another rollout of booster shots. [applause]
The condition and availability of school rooms for our students must also be addressed, again, in coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways.
Though some complications have arisen over the question of repair of school buildings in relation to the Mandanas-Garcia ruling, this will be ironed out.
We have been in discussion with local government leaders, Governors and Mayors, in the last few weeks to determine, with the LGUs, what is actually practicable, what functions belong to the LGUs and what belong to the National Government.
There have also been lengthy discussions on the continuation and viability of the K to 12 school system. We are giving this a careful review, and all necessary inputs and points of view are now being considered.
In the longer term, we are instituting a program of refresher courses and re-trainings for our teachers so they can stay abreast of the rapid growth in technology, especially in this post-pandemic world. [applause]
As for the ‘horror’ stories that we have heard about the poor quality of educational materials and supplies that are being given to our schools — this must end! [applause]
Our children must always be equipped with the best that we can provide.
Ang edukasyon ay ang tangi nating pamana sa ating mga anak na hindi mawawaldas. Kaya anumang gastusin sa kanilang pag-aaral ay hindi tayo nagtitipid. Hindi rin tayo nagtatapon.
And once again, I am not talking about history, or what is being taught. I am talking about materials that are necessary for effective teaching in this day and age.
Children now need connectivity to the internet; they need devices to use; they need computers, educational tools [applause] so that they might participate fully in the digital community here and abroad.
We must do better in the international rankings especially when it comes to the so-called STEM subjects: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.
These skills and this knowledge are necessary for our young people to be able to compete in a highly technological and competitive world.
The raw talent is there in our young people. It is up to our educational system to develop and to refine that great pool of talent. [applause]
Foreign employers have always favored Filipino employees because of our command of the English language. This is an advantage that we must continue to enjoy.
The internet has now become the global marketplace. Not only for goods services but also for ideas, even extending to our own personal interactions.
The language of the internet — for better or for worse — is English.
Therefore, the question of our medium of instruction must be continuously re-examined to maintain that advantage that we have established as an English-speaking people. [applause]
On a related subject, we are entering an age of exponential adoption of technology. It is the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
This will be characterized by the infusion of technology into almost every facet of our lives. Breakthrough technologies in the areas of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, nano technologies, the internet of things, robotics, self-driving electric vehicles, 3D printing, Virtual and Augmented Reality, among others that will radically transform the way business is done.
The scale and the speed at which these innovations are introduced universally into our everyday lives and activities is unprecedented in our recorded history.
We cannot stand idly by.
The mission of our Department of Information and Communications Technology is to identify and utilize these innovations to improve governance.
It has the daunting task now of transforming our government into an agile bureaucracy that is responsive to the needs of the public, provide good and solid data to ensure informed decision-making, as well as allow secure and seamless access to public services.
The voluminous records stored in the government warehouses and archives have to be digitized. Those that are already stored in various inventories of data should be harmonized and shared across departments and agencies.
Needless to say, these have to be kept in large data centers that are secure yet accessible.
The National ID will play an important part in this digital transformation. [applause]
For citizens to be able to seamlessly transact with government, their identity must be easily verifiable.
We expect to issue 30-million physical IDs and 20-million digital IDs by the end of this year. [applause] The target is to accomplish the issuance of about 92-million IDs by the middle of next year.
As the world moves into rapid digitalization, the digital divide will become more pronounced. The depth and breadth at which these technologies will be transformative in our lives is fully expected.
This will open new opportunities for the creation of wealth but will also likely create inequalities.
Hence, universal connectivity will be a vital component in order to ensure that no citizen is left behind. [applause]
I have therefore tasked the DICT to deploy digital connectivity across our various islands. This will be done through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, the common tower program, connecting our Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA) via our ‘Broad Band ng Masa’ project. [applause]
All relevant modes of digital transport should be utilized. These may be through a combination of terrestrial or submarine fiber optics, wireless and even satellite technology.
As our Public Service Act has opened the doors and removed the restrictions on foreign investment, we foresee an increase in direct investment of overseas players.
This will translate into better quality, availability and affordability of telecommunications services all over the country.
We come now to infrastructure. The backbone of an economy is its infrastructure.
The infrastructure program of the Duterte administration must not only continue but, wherever possible, be expanded. [applause]
We shall confidently build on this firm foundation established by my predecessor. As it is in building an edifice.
We must keep the momentum. And aspire to BUILD BETTER MORE.
Necessarily, infrastructure development will remain a very high priority in our drive for growth and employment.
Once again, I will not suspend any of the ongoing projects as those have already been shown to be of benefit to the public that they serve. [applause]
We will continue to study the proposals that have been made.
Infrastructure development spending will be sustained at 5% to 6% of GDP.
The planned expansion of infrastructure projects, I believe, would be possible if we continue to encourage the participation of the private sector in the development of our programs.
Public Private Partnerships or PPPs hold great potential for that expansion, [applause] for infrastructure development and for innovation.
Our infrastructure development is of primary importance as it is a necessary element to improve many other sectors — to include agriculture, tourism, general economic activity, and even to governance.
It is my belief also that we have missed some great opportunities to develop our rail transport system.
It is clear in my mind that railways offer great potential as it continues to be the cheapest way of transporting goods and passengers.
We can build upon already existing lines by modernizing these old railway systems.
There are dozens of railway projects – on the ground, above the ground, below ground, not just in Manila, but in other regions – at various stages of implementation, and with a combined cost of 1.9 trillion pesos. [applause]
This Administration is committed to finish building the current portfolio of investments: approved railway projects such as the North-South Commuter Railway System, [applause] the 33-kilometer Metro Manila Subway Project, the 147-kilometer North-South Commuter Railway System, the 12-kilometer LRT-1 Cavite Extension, [applause] the 23-kilometer MRT-7, and the Common Station that will connect LRT-1, MRT-3 and MRT-7.
And beyond NCR, larger scale railway systems like the 102-kilometer Mindanao Railway Project; [applause] the Panay Railway Project; [applause] and the Cebu railway system will be integrated as a vital part of our transport and communications systems.
We will also continue to improve our roads and transportation systems in key cities throughout the country through various projects such as the Cebu Bus Rapid Transit, Davao High Priority Bus System, Ilocos Norte Transportation Hub, and the El Nido Transport Terminal. [applause]
My order to the Department of Transportation or DOTr is really very simple: FULL SPEED AHEAD! [applause]
Improving our railway system, along with modernizing existing airports and seaports, will maximize our strategic location in the Pacific. And connect our many islands.
A key sector in our transformation plans is that of energy.
Another fundamental requirement for growth and increased employment will be the availability of cheap, reliable energy. This even comes under the category of “ease of doing business”. If we are to attract investors, both local and foreign, to set up shop here in the Philippines.
At present, our demand for energy far exceeds our reliable supply. We must increase the level of energy production. We must look at every possible option that would be appropriate for the Philippine situation. There is some room to expand our present power supply through existing power sources, but this is only to a very limited extent. We must build new power plants. [applause] We must take advantage of all the best technology that is now available, especially in the areas of renewable energy. [applause]
Our search for new power sources should always be with an eye to improving the mix of the energy supply between traditional and renewable sources.
The technology on renewable energy is progressing rapidly. And many of these technologies are appropriate for the Philippines. We have already begun windmill power. We are now expanding very quickly our solar power production.
For both offshore and on-shore wind turbines, for example, the World Bank has calculated that there is the potential of 255 gigawatts by the year of 2030. [applause]
Solar power has steadily increased its efficiency in converting sunlight to electrical power, which is particularly attractive for the Philippines. Because unlike wind power, solar power is practical almost everywhere in the Philippines all year round.
In the move to lowering our carbon footprint caused by energy production, our advancement to renewables will have a lead time.
In the interim, natural gas will hold the key. We will provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly in the area close to Malampaya.
This requires clarification of the processes and review of service contracts policy.
I believe that it is time also to re-examine our strategy towards building nuclear power plants in the Philippines. [applause]
We will comply of course with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after Fukushima. In the area of nuclear power, there have been new technologies developed that allow smaller scale modular nuclear plants and other derivations thereof.
Once again, PPPs will play a part in support as funding in this period is limited. [applause]
Furthermore, we must examine the entire system of transmission and distribution for the purpose of finding ways to lower the price of energy to the consumer and to industry.
We must expand the network of our transmission lines while examining schemes to improve the operation of our electrical cooperatives. All this in aid of reducing energy cost especially but not limited to households. [applause]
All this impetus for development and growth, we undertake within the context of accelerating climate change and extreme weather conditions.
Though we are a minor contributor to climate change globally, we have the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.
For the welfare of our people, it is incumbent upon us to alleviate the effects of that vulnerability.
The use of renewable energy is at the top of our climate agenda. We will increase our use of renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal power, solar, and wind.
Geographically, we are a disaster-prone country. Capacity building for our natural disaster resiliency is therefore a must. Investment in science and technology is imperative to enable us to have accurate weather forecasts and on-time disaster alerts.
Studies show that already now many areas in the Philippines are at high risk from the rise in sea levels brought about by the increase in global temperature. We must adapt to this phenomenon with disaster-proof planning of our communities.
We will also look into the precarious fresh water supply situation in the country, especially in our urban areas. Many of our water supply systems date back to the 1950’s, and they must now be rehabilitated and improved.
I have instructed the DENR together with the DPWH, to explore possible partnerships with the private sector to address this crucial situation.
The Philippines has excellent laws on the environment, but we have to guarantee that these laws are properly enforced. And this will require a great deal of coordination and cooperation between concerned government agencies and private stakeholders.
Companies who exploit our natural resources must follow the law. We all have the responsibility to preserve this Earth, for we are but custodians, and we will pass on this great treasure to future generations. [applause]
There is no question that the preservation of the environment is the preservation of life. [applause]
If we cannot mitigate climate change, all our plans for the economy, all our plans for our future, will be for naught.
Bawat Pilipino sa ibayong dagat na nagsasakripisyong lisanin ang kanyang pamilya sa Pilipinas upang mag-hanapbuhay ay nararapat lamang magkaroon ng pamahalaang matatawag nilang “tahanan” habang nasa ibang bayan. [applause]
Ito ang papel na gagampanan ng Kagawaran ng Manggagawang Mandarayuhan o Department of Migrant Workers matapos itong ideklara bilang ganap na ahensiya ng gobyerno noong isang taon. [applause]
Ang kagawarang ito ang magsisilbing kanlungan ng ating mga kababayan sa gitna ng mundong walang kasiguruhan at mahigpit na kumpetisyon. Ito ang maglalatag sa kanila ng mga oportunidad; titiyak na ang kanilang mga hanapbuhay ay tugma sa kanilang mga kasanayan; maninigurong akma ang sahod at maayos ang kalagayan sa kanilang mga kumpanya; at mangangalaga sa kanilang mga pamilya habang sila ay nasa malayo.
Gagawin natin ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-aalis ng red tape sa sistema ng pagsusulong ng digital empowerment. We shall automate the verification of contracts and issue secure Overseas Employment Certifications (OEC) that you can keep on your smartphone. I call on the Department of Migrant Workers and the DICT to make this a top priority. [applause]
Tinatawagan ko rin ang Department of Foreign Affairs na makipagtulungan sa Department of Migrant Workers na tiyakin ang lahat ng mga diplomatic post ay tutulong na agarang maibalik sa trabaho ang mga ating mga Overseas Filipino workers na nawalan ng hanapbuhay nitong nakalipas na ilang taon. [applause]
Mula sa tatlong buwan ay gagawin na lang nating tatlong linggo para sa isang dayuhang employer na i-proseso ang mga papeles ng Pilipinong nais nitong kunin bilang empleyado. [applause]
Aatasan din natin ang kagawaran na gawing simple ang kumplikadong handbook ng mga tuntunin at regulasyon para sa mga OFW, nang sa gayon ay maging maalwan ang mga transaksyong may kinalaman sa kanilang pangingibang-bansa.
Mula sa handbook na may dalawang daan at apatnapung (240) seksyon ay gagawin nating pamphlet na lamang na hindi hihigit sa isandaang pahina. [applause]
Mahirap na nga ang buhay, kaya naman ayaw pa natin makitang lalo pang nahihirapan ang ating mga manggagawang mandarayuhan sa pagtupad sa kanilang mga pangarap.
Para sa mga kababayan nating naiipit sa kaguluhan, inaabuso, at nanganganib ang buhay, ikinagagalak kong sa ilalim ng aking pamumuno, ay ilulunsad natin ang One Repatriation Command Center o ORCC. Ilalaan natin ang isang social media platform ng Department of Migrant Workers at ang hotline upang matulungan agad at mailigtas sila mula sa mas higit na kapahamakan. [applause]
Noon, nangungutang pa ang isang ina ng bawat OFW upang sumakay ng barko para pumunta sa Maynila at mangatok sa iba’t ibang ahensiya para mapauwi ang anak na inaapi. Ngayon, kami na ang tatawag sa mga magulang ng OFWs [applause] para sabihin sa kanila ang petsa kung kailan nila mayayakap at makakapiling ang kanilang mga anak. [applause]
Sa kasalukuyan ay nakikipag-ugnayan tayo sa pamahalaan ng Saudi Arabia upang buksang muli ang deployment. Kaya natin, at gagawin natin, ang makipag-negosasyon na mabigyan ang ating mga kababayan doon ng tamang pasahod, at mapangalagaan ang kanilang karapatan at kapakanan.
Muli nating pagtitibayin ang respeto at pagkakaibigan ng ating dalawang bansa tulad ng namagitan sa aking ama at sa kanilang hari.
Sa mga susunod na buwan ay magtutungo si Secretary Susan Ople sa Saudi Arabia upang tiyakin na may sapat na puwersang magsisiguro na mabubuksang muli ang empleyo sa bansa, [applause] at para maisulong ang ating kampanya laban sa human trafficking.
Ngayon, para naman sa mga anak na naiwan sa Pilipinas. Titiyakin ng Department of Migrant Workers, sa pamamagitan ng OWWA, na sila ay maipapasok sa magagandang paaralang magtuturo sa kanila ng financial literacy, mental wellness, sports, sining at kultura. Ito ay mangyayari sa pakikipagtulungan ng iba’t ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaan. Alagaan natin ang kabataang Pilipino sapagkat sila ang kinabukasan ng ating Inang Bayan. [applause]
Sa ating mga kababayan na nasa ibang bansa: You deserve a Home in Government not only for the money that you send home, but you are not cold tools of the economy. You deserve it for your sacrifices, for our country and your perseverance and excellence in the global arena.
You, OFWs, represent the fighting faith of the Filipinos as a nation and as a people. Let us transform your overseas journey into inspirational stories for all time.
Thanks to you, our dear legislators, and of course, to the man, every OFW now refers to as their “Tatay”, President Rodrigo Duterte. You passed the law that created this new home for our OFWs. [applause]
On the area of foreign policy, I will not preside over any process that will abandon even one square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power. [applause and cheers]
With respect to our place in the community of nations, the Philippines shall continue to be a friend to all, an enemy to none.
The Philippines has always been open and welcoming to all our foreign friends and visitors. That is our world view, that is our culture.
BUT LET ME BE CLEAR. WE ARE VERY JEALOUS OF ALL THAT IS FILIPINO. [applause]
We will be a good neighbor — always looking for ways to collaborate and cooperate with the end goal of mutually beneficial outcomes.
If we agree, we will cooperate and we will work together. And if we differ, let us talk some more until we develop a consensus.
After all, that is THE FILIPINO WAY.
But we will not waver. We will stand firm in our independent foreign policy, with the national interest as our primordial guide. [applause]
We commit to maintaining good relations with the rest of the world.
As a matter of fact, it is my sincere belief that the need for strong bonds and collaboration among nations emerges in the direst of times, such as in a pandemic.
The partnerships and alliances that we make with all will provide the stability that all nations will need as we emerge into this new global economy.
The Philippines will continue to promote stronger and multi-faceted relationships with all our partners around the world.
We are, in fact, grateful for the messages of support and offers of help that we have received from many of our friends in the international community. This has been communicated to us through the different Envoys and the Ambassadors here in the Philippines.
Such strong relationships can only be beneficial to all involved.
