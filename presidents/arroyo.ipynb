Quezon \\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly on National Defense\\n[Delivered in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building on November 25, 1935]\\nMr. Speaker, gentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nAs I appear before you for the first time, allow me to extend to you my cordial greetings and congratulations upon your election to this august body. It is your unique privilege to serve our country at the most critical period of its existence—at a time when the course of its destiny will be charted.\\nThe framers of our Constitution conferred upon our Government all the power and authority needed to meet the demands of a progressive and enlightened epoch so that it may be able to promote the welfare and happiness of our people and safeguard their liberty.\\nI know you are well aware of the share of responsibility in the task of government which belongs to you. Unlike the Legislature that preceded you, which had two Houses, this National Assembly is by itself the whole Legislative Department of the government. When you take final action on a measure, there is no other legislative branch that will pass upon and give it further consideration. The measure as you pass it goes directly to the Chief Executive, who is devoid of any power to alter it in any way and has no alternative except that of giving it his express or implied approval, or of vetoing it.\\nIn my opinion, the main responsibility for legislative action is yours. It will be my policy as Chief Executive to give you, in every case, the benefit of doubt. You may, therefore, rest assured that, if ever, I shall exercise my veto power with reluctance, and only when I am strongly convinced that it is my plain and unavoidable duty to do so in the interest of the common weal.\\nArticle VII, section 11, (5) of the Constitution directs the President to present to the National Assembly, from time to time, information on the state of the Nation, and to recommend to its consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\nIn the fulfillment of this duty, I am addressing the National Assembly today on the fundamental responsibility of a state—on a question involving our very existence when we become a free member of the family of nations. This question is that of assuring the future safety of our beloved country.\\nSelf-defense is the supreme right of mankind, no more sacred to the individual than to the nation, the interests of which are immeasurably of greater significance and extent. A threat against the nation involves not alone the life of one individual, but of millions; not the welfare and fortune of a single family, but of all. And above everything else, depending upon the exercise of the right of national self-defense is freedom itself, the most precious reward from Heaven to the worthy. This immutable principle is firmly incorporated in our Constitution—the Magna Charta of Philippine Liberty.\\nWe, the citizens of these Islands, are now fairly started upon the final stretch of the long road we have so patiently and persistently followed toward the goal of independence. Up to here the trail has been a tortuous one. But the difficulties we have encountered and the frustrations we have endured have not deterred us from our purpose. They have served only to spur us onward—to increase the intensity of our undying devotion to the cause for which no cost could be too great, no sacrifice too bitter. And now at last, with success so plainly in our sight, our love of liberty and the voice of reason alike urge us to guard and cherish the prize that has been so hardly won.\\nI would be recreant to my duty did I not come to you, in my first appearance before the National Assembly, to ask your ungrudging support for the establishment of a sound system of National Defense. This is our first and most urgent need.\\nAs we commit ourselves to this important task we realize that a war-weary world groans under a burden of armaments. Every accretion to the accumulated total is invariably subjected to careful and even suspicious scrutiny. But the world must be well aware that in the present state of our development, the establishment within these Islands of an aggressive force capable of threatening the security of any other nation would be fantastic. Consequently, without fear that any act of ours may be misunderstood or resented by others, we are free to undertake every preparatory measure of defense that the circumstances of our situation may require.\\nNevertheless, it is well that we now announce, through clear delineation of our objective, definite limits upon the efforts we shall make in this direction. That objective is a single one—peace—permanent peace! This objective is proclaimed in our own Constitution and no Filipino dares to challenge it. No purpose of our own, no conceivable temptation or manipulation from abroad, can ever lead us into war save in defense of our own rights, waged within the limits of our own territory. Our full desire is to insure domestic tranquillity and to guarantee to our citizens the opportunity to pursue, without external molestation, prosperity and happiness under a stable government, devised, developed, and maintained by the people themselves.\\nIn furtherance of this purpose I shall submit to you a comprehensive plan for national defense. In my opinion the plan reflects the lessons of history, the conclusions of acknowledged masters of warfare and of statesmanship, and the sentiments and aspirations of the Filipino people. It is founded upon enduring principles that are fundamental to any plan applicable to our needs.\\nThe first of these principles is that every citizen is obligated to the nation’s defense. All the individual and national resources may be used by the State in the interest of self-preservation. No man has the inalienable right to enjoy the privileges and opportunities conferred upon him by free institutions unless he simultaneously acknowledges his duty to defend with his life and with his property the Government through which he acquires these opportunities and these privileges. To deny this individual responsibility is to reject the whole theory of democratic government.\\nThis principle knows no limitation of time or condition. It is effective in war, in peace, and for as long as the nation shall endure. Impelled by cogent reasons I propose its specific application to our peace-time task of preparation, by requiring every citizen of suitable age and physique to undergo military training as an obligation to the State.\\nThe ultimate bulwark of liberty is the readiness of free citizens to sacrifice themselves in defense of that boon. Where this spirit has been inculcated through generations and has become firmly embedded in the public consciousness, nations have been strong, virile, prosperous, and stable. Where citizens have grown neglectful of this individual obligation, especially where they have sought to deny its validity, the result has been decadence, weakness, poverty, and destruction.\\nTo foster national pride and patriotism nothing is more effective than to participate actively in the processes of maintaining the national defense. Military training and service build up the spirit of duty and love of country. They nurture patriotism, loyalty, courage, and discipline. A nation of trained men ready to defend their country has the lasting respect of itself and of the world. A nation of helpless citizens can expect nothing but slavery at home, and contempt abroad. If we are wise, if we are mindful of the lessons history teaches, we will provide a military education for our entire manhood, beginning from early adolescence. To accomplish this purpose a utilization of the public-school system immediately suggests itself. By inculcating in rising generations the soldierly virtues, by preparing our people spiritually and physically to serve the state, our schools will be building upon solid foundations not only national consciousness and solidarity but also boldness of spirit which are indispensable to the free and uninterrupted development of this nation.\\nThe second basic principle is that our national defense system must provide actual security. Indeed, an insufficient defense is almost a contradiction in terms. A dam that crumbles under the rising flood is nothing more than a desolate monument to the wasted effort and lack of vision of its builders. In this one function of government there can be no compromise with minimum requirements. Our program of national defense must serve notice upon the world that the citizens of these Islands are not to be subjugated; that conquest of this nation cannot be accomplished short of its utter destruction, and that that destruction would involve such staggering cost to an aggressor, both in blood and gold, that even the boldest and the strongest will unerringly mark the folly of such an undertaking.\\nThe next principle to which I hold is the insistent need for current and future economy. Although there are no costs of peace comparable to those that would surely follow defeat in war, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the Government to avoid every unnecessary expenditure. During the three centuries of Philippine history as a dependency, there have been largely lifted from our shoulders the burdens incident to sovereignty, particularly those of providing for our own protection. These burdens our people now gladly accept. They stand ready to pay the cost, whatever it may be, of assuring the permanent security and integrity of the homeland. But for us in the Government, to permit this cost to exceed the minimum demanded by the purpose that we seek would be an inexcusable blunder and a betrayal of the trust reposed in us.\\nThe need for minimizing expense not only requires the utmost efficiency in details, but also it clearly indicates the basic character of the defensive establishment we must devise. Specifically, it precludes, for the present at least, the development of a battle fleet. Naval strength is expressed principally in terms of fighting ships, each of which, even in the small and auxiliary categories, can be produced only at tremendous cost. It is manifestly impossible, in the current state of our economic development, to acquire a fleet that could offer even partially effective resistance to any existing navy worthy of the name.\\nOne desirable effect of a decision to forego the construction of a battle fleet will be to emphasize the passively defensive character of our military establishment. Tactically, a fleet cannot operate as a purely defensive force and is useless unless it can proceed to see and engage its enemy beyond the limits of its own bases. Moreover, the existence of a powerful navy inherently implies a possibility of aggressive intent, since only with strong naval support could an army hope to invade the territory of an overseas enemy. Consequently, as an island nation, our lack of sea power will confirm before the world our earnest intent to develop an army solely for defensive purposes.\\nAnother fundamental premise is the necessity for a gradual rather than sudden growth of the required defense establishment. Both economy and efficiency demand no immediate and complete organization of a force of the necessary eventual strength. A modern army is a complex organism, and its defensive power is not measured solely by the number of its soldiers. Suitable armament, proper organization, professional technique and skill, applicable tactical doctrine and, above all, trained leadership are the very soul of an army’s combat efficiency. However lavish may be the expenditure, these things cannot be instantly acquired. They are brought about only through thoughtful, painstaking, and persistent effort, intelligently directed. Progress in these fields will determine the rate at which the whole development, including increases in personnel strength, may logically and efficiently proceed.\\nNevertheless, it is imperative that our plans reach fruition by the time the beneficent protection of the United States shall have been finally withdrawn. We have ten years, and only ten, in which to initiate and complete the development of our defensive structure, the creation of which, because of the conditions of our past existence, must now begin at the very foundations. Not a moment is to be lost. Starting immediately, we must build economically and gradually, but steadily and surely, so as to attain within the time permitted us the highest possible efficiency at the lowest possible cost.\\nFinally, I must emphasize the need for logical governmental procedure in this development—a procedure calculated to minimize error and to avoid loss of time, waste of resources, and unnecessary exposure of the country to the risks of unpreparedness. Since our security arrangements must be carefully moulded to fit the special and particular needs of our country, there exists nowhere in the world a model upon which our own defenses may be blindly patterned. Step by step we must design a new organism, and in doing so we must advance progressively from the general to the specific; from the explored to the unexplored. A continuous adjustment of essential details to constantly evolving requirements will be mandatory. Such a procedure will be possible only through the exercise of administrative authority, taking advantage of the highest professional and technical advice. But since under our form of government, administrative authority is limited to the task of execution, it is highly important that initial legislation for the erection of the nation’s defenses should confer upon the President as Commander-in-Chief, a very considerable latitude in carrying out the expressed purposes of the National Assembly. Any attempt, at the outset of this undertaking, to formulate a plan that would prescribe in concrete and inflexible language every detail of the complete development could not fail to result in added cost and slow progress.\\nThe essential elements of our defensive system will in time become more clearly crystallized and definitely moulded to the needs of the nation. Then, it will be time for the National Assembly to enact legislation with such details as it may deem desirable.\\nBut though details of design in the superstructure of defense should, at least for the present, be charged to the Chief Executive, the Assembly must retain the responsibility of assuring the soundness of its foundations. It is not only the prerogative but also the duty of the Legislative Department to evolve and to prescribe the broad policies that are to control progress in this critically important task. Likewise it is a function of the Legislative Body to bestow specific authorization and to provide the funds essential to the purpose it seeks. Supported by such authority and guided by these policies, the Chief Executive will be enabled to proceed confidently and expeditiously toward the accomplishment of the legislative intent.\\nThe central feature of the defensive system I propose is a trained and organized force, normally engaged in the pursuits of peace, and ready for effective employment whenever the interests of the nation so demand. Service in this force is to be rendered as a patriotic obligation to the state. Upon reaching maturity, each able-bodied male citizen will automatically become liable for a period of intensive military training. From the number annually attaining this age, a training quota of the required size will be selected by lot. Moreover, so far as the capacity of the Army will permit, volunteers from among those not so selected, or from older age groups, will be incorporated into the training cadres. Upon completion of his training period, each citizen will return to civil life, but as a member of an Army reserve unit. Thus the burden of defense will be widely distributed, and each citizen will devote to exclusive military activity only an insignificant portion of his time.\\nThe regular element of the Army, composed of volunteers from every geographical area of the Islands, will eventually attain a maximum strength of 1,500 officers and 19,000 enlisted men, including the existing Constabulary. Its officers and men will pursue the military profession as a life’s career and devote themselves exclusively to the nation’s defense. The Regular Army must become a model of efficiency—the energizing element and, professionally, the directing head of the whole establishment. Its missions will comprehend the maintenance of permanent overhead for the entire force, including such essential services as procurement, storage, transportation, communication, and sanitation; the prosecution of research and experimentation to keep the Army abreast of latest developments in every branch of the military profession; and instruction of the reserve.\\nIn organizational and operational outline the proposed system is the essence of simplicity. Under its provisions the Chief of Staff of the Army is selected by and is directly responsible to the President, and will have the rank of a Secretary of Department. Under him will be a Department of National Defense comprising the several staff sections required for general supervision of the whole military establishment and for the control of administration, training, maintenance, and other essential functions.\\nThe reserve units will be dispersed through all the Islands, approximately according to population. The national territory will be divided into military districts and subdistricts, in each of which will be maintained a small professional cadre for the training of the annual quota locally called to the colors. Training periods except for trainees selected to serve with the Regular Force will normally extend over a period of five and a half months. Thereafter, for ten years, each trainee will be required to undergo annually sufficient training to preserve individual and collective efficiency. From that time onward his training will grow progressively less.\\nUnder this system we will have, within ten years, hundreds of thousands of trained individuals, and eventually practically the entire male population will have had military training. The younger men of this group will be constantly organized into tactical formations. Supporting these units will be a pool of trained individuals, generally in higher age groups, but available in emergency for replacements in line organizations or for employment in staff services. Equipment and supplies for reserve organizations will be locally stored and maintained, under the control of professionally trained cadres.\\nSupplementing the training given in the Army will be the military instructional system in schools and colleges. Every educational institution wholly or partially supported at public expense is to serve, under the plan, as an agency for inculcating patriotism and for assisting in the important work of instructing our people in the essentials of the military profession. Starting with students, aged ten, intensive courses in citizenship, sanitation, and physical development will be progressively widened in scope during the period of adolescence, until at the age of eighteen, every able-bodied male student will have pursued a thorough course in elementary military practices and methods. As a consequence, even though quotas annually trained in the Army will comprise only a portion of the young men attaining the age of twenty-one, we will eventually acquaint our entire male population with the essential requirements of military service.\\nThe plan provides a comprehensive system for the emergency mobilization of the reserves so as to insure rapid, concerted, and efficient action in the face of emergency. It proposes yearly objectives in the procurement of armaments and equipment. All these things and many others, I have developed in as exhaustive detail as is now possible, to the end that my proposals to the National Assembly might comprise concrete rather than theoretical recommendations.\\nAlthough, in broad outline, the proposed system of defense may be thus briefly and accurately described, the governmental problems involved in transforming plans into actual accomplishment will be almost baffling in their intricacy and difficulty. Preliminary to undertaking actual development, necessary laws must be formulated and approved, and initial selections of higher military officials accomplished. Thereafter, and in full accord with the provisions of these legislative enactments, the professional and technical phases of the task will begin. Merely to name the more important of them is to indicate clearly the involved character of the project.\\nOrganization of the Department of National Defense must aim at efficient functioning, but must avoid extravagance entailed by the maintenance of unnecessary overhead. Its membership must possess the qualifications required by the purpose of each essential bureau, including those, for example, pertaining to armament, administration, supply, sanitation, and legal affairs.\\nAn efficient officer corps is the very soul of an army. To produce one of the requisite size and qualifications we must first provide for its gradual accumulation, so that future turn-over will involve only a small annual increment. We must evolve policies governing appointments, promotion, pay, assignment, and retirements, and must provide for the thorough military education of its members. Technical schools must be established, and for these the faculties must first be organized and thoroughly indoctrinated.\\nSuitable tactical organization of the Army, accurately adjusted to the necessities of Philippine conditions, must be developed. Applicable doctrine and method must be evolved. A skeletonized organization for registration of citizens subject to military training, and for receiving, caring for and training annual quotas must be established. Necessary programs pertaining to munitions, including such technical items as airplanes, rifles, cannon, machine guns, ammunition, signal equipment, bridging material, and a host of other matters must be formulated in accordance with our minimum needs. Inspection, accounting, and other phases of administration must be established and maintained. All these constitute immediate problems for which solutions must develop side by side, each fully articulated and synchronized with all others.\\nThis necessary control, direction, and coordination of a myriad of essential details represents one of the most difficult and critical problems of the entire project. In its importance to progress, it will, for some years to come, overshadow all others. For its successful solution there is immediately demanded, not only a technical ability that extends to every phase of the military profession, but also a broad and thorough experience in the field of higher administration, organization, and leadership. Unless these qualifications can be made constantly available to the Commonwealth we will pay for their lack in millions of squandered pesos, years of wasted time, and in confusion of effort and added risks to our nation’s security.\\nUnfortunately it is this type of ability and experience that, as yet, there has been little opportunity to develop among our own people. We have produced, both in the Constabulary and in the Philippine Scouts, officers of outstanding worth in particular lines of military endeavor, from among whom we confidently expect to obtain initially the senior officers of the new Army. But due to the conditions of our past existence we have had no War Department, no complete defense force, no balanced army, no exclusive responsibility for protection, and, consequently, no experience in the functions that now assume for us a transcendent importance.\\nIn this situation we have no alternative but to obtain this experience, this ability, and this skill from other sources, and in my anxiety on this score I earnestly considered all upon which we might logically depend.\\nEvery consideration of friendship and association supported the hope that this source might be the United States. Consequently, I presented to the President of that country the essentials of this problem and explained our dire need for help. More specifically I earnestly requested the detail of General Douglas MacArthur, then Chief of Staff of the United States Army, as the one soldier whose opinion on every question of military organization would command the respect of all our people. The President’s response was immediate, sympathetic, and definite.\\nAt a very real sacrifice to the American Army this officer, who since 1930 had served continuously as its Chief of Staff, has been made available to the Commonwealth Government as Military Adviser. His record in peace and war requires no eulogy from me. His qualifications for the important post in which he will serve are as clearly appreciated among our own people as they are in Washington. Because of this, and because also of his own known devotion to the Philippines and to the Filipino people, the wisdom of his choice will be universally recognized. I request authority to confer upon General MacArthur and his assistants the rank and emoluments that I deem in keeping with their important duties and the dignity of this nation.\\nThe several provisions of law fundamental to the development of Philippine defense are outlined in a draft of a bill which I shall presently furnish you. It depicts, in much greater detail than I have attempted here, the defense plan I propose for adoption. It represents the essence of the authorizations, directives, and general policies necessary to insure initiation of the project.\\nAgain, I emphasize the need for prompt and positive action in initiating this great project. In every other line of human endeavor we have built, not only the foundations, but also the framework and, in certain cases, even the edifice itself. But here, except for necessary law enforcement elements, not a stone has been laid.\\nThe refusal to grant us immediate and complete independence has been due, in large measure, to our present inability to cope with a general revolt or to offer any kind of resistance to an invading force. Your swift action on the defense measures I am proposing will prove the earnestness of our determination to be, and forever to remain, free and independent. What, I ask, would be the use of seeing our country free one day, with its own flag standing alone and flying against the sky, only to see ourselves the subjects of another power the following day, with its flag the sovereign in and of our country? What would be the purpose of educating our young men and women concerning their rights and privileges as free citizens, if tomorrow they are to be subjects of a foreign foe? Why build up the wealth of the Nation only to swell up the coffers of another? If that be our preordained fate, why seek a new master when the Stars and Stripes has given us not only justice and fair treatment, welfare and prosperity, but also ever increasing political liberties including independence?\\nNational freedom now stands before us as a shining light—the freedom that for many years gleamed only fitful candle in the distant dark. We shall make ourselves ready to grasp the torch, so that no predatory force may ever strike it from our hands!\\n</td>\n",

Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly\\nOn the Country’s conditions and problems\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the First Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on June 16, 1936]\\nMr. Speaker, Gentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nSeven months ago this Commonwealth was inaugurated amidst the general rejoicing of our people, and with misgivings on the part of some timorous individuals. Today the Government of the Commonwealth counts with the confidence and respect of all. True, there are still a few prophets of disaster, but these need not seriously disturb us, for it is evident that it is only their wish that is father to their forebodings.\\nOur Relations with America\\nUnder the provisions of the Independence Act incorporated into our Constitution, the Government of the United States retains direct control and supervision over our foreign affairs, as well as certain specific powers in a few cases of domestic character. These powers are vested in the President of the United States whose representative in the Islands is the United States High Commissioner. My personal and official relations with High Commissioner Frank Murphy have been most cordial, and the highest spirit of cooperation has characterized the transactions of our Government with the Washington Administration.\\nIt was with a deep sense of loss that our people saw High Commissioner Murphy depart for the United States and it is their hope that he will soon return to the Philippines.\\nThe Gold Reserve Funds and the Excise Tax on Oil\\nIt is with regret that I have to inform you that the Senate of the United States has passed a bill repealing the Act recognizing the equity of the Philippine Government on the sum of P47,000,000 arising from the devaluation of the dollar as a reimbursement for the depreciation of our reserves deposited in the United States. Were this bill to pass Congress, our Government would be made to incur a loss or that American officials have done contrary to the recommendation of Filipino representatives. I have not, however, given up the hope that the House of Representatives will not follow the action of the Senate, for I cannot conceive that America, which in this case acted as the guardian of Filipino interests, should want to profit from the losses of her ward. I know that High Commissioner Murphy has done and is doing everything he can to secure this fund for the Philippines.\\nAgain there are attempts to enact legislation reverting to the Treasury of the United States the proceeds of the excise tax on coconut oil imported from the Philippines. The amount of collections is now around P56,000,000 and is deposited in the United States Treasury. Payment to the Government of the Philippines in accordance with the law has been suspended in view of cases pending in the courts contesting the validity of the law. It is my earnest belief that Congress will not approve the proposed legislation above referred to. Heretofore, whenever the Congress of the United States has taxed goods or products imported into the United States from the Philippines, invariably it has provided the payment of all collections to our Government. It is, therefore, beyond my comprehension that at this stage of our relations with America that record of fair dealing and justice should be reversed. We are also counting upon the help of Commissioner Murphy and other friends in Congress to prevent the enactment of the said law.\\nOur Foreign Population\\nI am happy to be able to inform the Assembly that the foreign population of the Islands has, since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, shown a genuine desire to cooperate with our people to make this government a signal success.\\nMuch has been printed in the local and foreign papers regarding the ownership of large tracts of land by Japanese subjects in Davao. There is an impression that Davao is actually owned by the Japanese. Such is not the case.\\nThe total area owned, leased and/or cultivated by the Japanese in Davao is about 60,000 hectares out of almost two million hectares that constitute the total area of the public domain in that province. It is true that Japanese investments in Davao are considerable, and that there are doubts expressed as to the legality of some of the transactions entered into between Filipinos and Japanese regarding the public domain leased to Filipinos by the Government. In these cases the Government will act in accordance with law and equity. Before any course of action is finally decided upon by the Administration, I shall advise with the Assembly and take no step without your previous knowledge. There is nothing in the so-called Davao problem that should cause serious concern.\\nPeace and Order\\nThe country has never been entirely free from armed bandits or outlaws as it has been during the last four months. At the beginning of the present administration there were two armed bands which had been marauding in the Provinces of Laguna and Tayabas for some time, and there was at large one notorious bandit in the Province of Lanao who for many years had been terrorizing that district with murders and robberies. Two hours after my inauguration as Chief Executive I had a conference with the governors of Laguna and Tayabas and the Chief of Constabulary, and I instructed them to spare no effort in the capture or extermination of these outlaws. Soon thereafter the Lanao bandit having resisted arrest was killed by the Constabulary and within two months every members of the armed bands in Laguna and Tayabas had been either captured or killed. However, there is still the danger of possible sporadic public disturbances like the uprising of the Sakdalistas which took place a year ago last May. Professional demagogues who make their living by exploiting the patriotism of the uninformed or the real or fancied grievances of the discontented, are exciting the masses with incendiary speeches and literature. Communism has also been active during the last few years and while its propaganda has not been particularly effective the forces of law and order have to be constantly on guard. There is not, of course, the slightest danger of any general uprising, but we cannot allow any serious disturbance of the public order to take place. One of the few cases which may give occasion for American intervention is the failure of the Government to preserve order and to protect life, property, and individual liberty. The world is watching this experiment in Filipino self-government, and the confidence and respect which in the future the nations may have in the Philippine Republic will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain peace and order and to extend effective protection to all the residents of the Islands during the transition period. Knowing as I do the great superiority of the forces of the Government over any misguided group that may be induced to armed revolt, it causes me anguish to think that under my administration the armed forces of the government may be compelled to take such drastic measure as would exact a greater toll of life than during the Sakdalista uprising. From every point of view, therefore, it is better that preventive measures be taken, and it is my earnest hope that the National Assembly will not delay the enactment of appropriate legislation to this end.\\nSocial Justice\\nWhile the Government cannot compromise with public disorder, it is equally its duty to right social injustices. That our laborers in the farm as well as in the factories still suffer from long-standing unfair practices, no one can successfully deny. These injustices, however, cannot be remedied by merely applying here legislation in force in other countries. For such legislation would not take into account local conditions, nor the incipient stage of our industrial life and the almost primitive state of our agriculture. Government administration is a practical question and statesmanship consists in the wise application of sound doctrines bearing in mind the actual conditions that have to be met with in each case. Even the most up-to-date progressive labor legislation, if not in keeping with the prevailing conditions here, may easily upset our existing industries, preventing the establishment of new ones, and retard the advance of our agriculture. I, therefore, advocate a policy of progressive conservatism based upon the recognition of the essential and fundamental rights of labor.\\nThe Philippine Legislature has in the past enacted several measures for the protection of labor, but while they have improved somewhat the lot of the workingman to the extent that the Filipino laborer enjoys more rights and privileges than his brother in other Oriental countries, it is necessary that we should go further and give better and more effective protection to the rights and interests of our wage-earners. I would, therefore, urge the enactment of a law authorizing the creation of boards of arbitration to settle questions of labor, minimum wages, working conditions, and other matters affecting their relations.\\nWith the passage of the Tenancy Law, it was believed that the relationship between the landowner and tenant could be maintained on a fair and satisfactory basis. Although the legislation has been in the statute book for several years, I do not know of a single locality which has put it into effect, as its enforcement in any province was made dependent on an affirmative resolution of the majority of the municipal councils of that province. There is now more discontent and social unrest among the farm laborers than among the industrial workers. I believe this situation will be materially improved by the enactment of the Arbitration Board Law to which I have referred.\\nThe large landed estates or “haciendas” offer a different problem. This administration, by the Coalition platform, is committed to the policy favoring the acquisition of these estates at a fair and just price, so they may be sold in small lots to the tenants. I regret to state that after a careful study of this question, I have reached the conclusion that such a step would not remedy the situation nor could it be carried out without exposing the country to great financial losses.\\nImmediately after assuming office, I instructed the Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture and Commerce to give me the necessary information so that I might recommend to the National Assembly at this regular session the purchase of these landed estates or “haciendas” and their subsequent sale to the tenants. Both Secretaries of said Departments have personally investigated some of the outstanding controversies between some of the “haciendas” and their tenants, and I have also taken part in one of those investigations. I have likewise studied the effects of the purchase of the so-called friar lands.\\nIt is now my earnest conviction that the purchase of these “haciendas” by the Government will not solve the agrarian and social problems existing therein, but will only transfer to the Government the difficulties which the tenants now have with the present landowners.\\nThe friar lands were acquired by the Government for the purpose of reselling them in small parcels to the men who were working on these lands; but, for several causes, the result has been that a large area of these “haciendas” is now in the hands of other people. The lot of the former tillers of these lands has not in the least improved. The investment, therefore, of several millions of pesos by the Government in the purchase of the friar lands has only been, with few exceptions, for the benefit of people not contemplated by the Government. The latest report I have is that in this transaction the Government lost heavily. If the Philippine Government lost then when the price paid for the friar lands was relatively low, it is evident that now, that the price asked for these “haciendas” is very much higher, the Government is bound to suffer a greater loss. There might be some justification in exposing the country to this financial loss if, through such purchase, the majority of the people working on them were to become the owners of the land which they are now cultivating. I am positive, however, that such will not be the case, any more than it was in the case of the friar lands, and I, for one, despite the commitment in the Coalition platform, do not wish to impose upon our people the burden of a national debt which our children will have to bear merely to give a few individuals the opportunity to acquire these particular areas at the expense of the people when there is so much available fertile and untouched public land in many regions of our country, particularly in Mindanao.\\nI realize the difficulty of convincing the men and their families who are now living in these “haciendas” to move out from their places of birth in order to settle in other provinces or islands, knowing as I do the attachment of the Filipino to his hometown. We must encourage our people to have a national outlook so that they may feel at home in whatever corner of the Philippines they may find themselves. We thus have an opportunity to induce the settlement of our sparsely populated areas by the tenants of these “haciendas,” and the money that the Government would surely lose with their purchase could be invested to better advantage in the construction of roads and improvement of health conditions in said uninhabited but rich sections of the Philippines.\\nIn the meantime, I recommend the adoption of measures similar to those which were adopted in Ireland to solve agrarian problems there which have been existing from time immemorial. I also recommend the immediate passage of a law authorizing the expropriation of those portions of the large “haciendas” which are urban in character and are occupied by the houses of the tenants. With the opportunity to own their own homes thus assured, the settlement of the present difficulties of the tenants relative to their farm lands might no longer be of urgent necessity.\\nPrevious Legislative Enactments\\nIn your inaugural session, which lasted barely thirty days, you enacted the most important legislation pledged in the Coalition platform and urgently required by the nature of the new responsibilities of the present government. The record you have made has earned for you just commendation and constitutes the main reason for the prevailing confidence in our future. I now beg leave to report what has been done by Executive in compliance with your legislative enactments.\\nNational Defense –Conscious of the fact that the prime duty of every government is to provide for national defense, the first measure you have enacted is the “National Defense Act” (Commonwealth Act No. 1).\\nThis Act provides for the reorganization of a defensive system composed of the Regular Force and a trained citizen army, and contemplates a yearly appropriation of P16,000,000 for ten years, at the end of which the nation will be placed in a position of serene dignity amongst the powers of the world.\\nA comprehensive report of the steps taken in pursuance of the provisions of the National Defense Act has been submitted to be by the Military Adviser and it will be my pleasure to transmit it to you in a separate message. Suffice it for me to say now that the response of the country to the call of the Assembly has exceeded our fondest expectations. The number of Filipinos who enrolled on the date fixed for registration in accordance with the provisions of the National Defense Act was greatly in excess of what had been anticipated; in fact it was almost double our estimates. The school teachers who were given instructions in training camps to equip them with the knowledge necessary to carry out the work assigned to them in the schools under the provisions of the National Defense Act, conducted themselves so well and their training was so successful that they deserve from me a well-merited public recognition. It has been plainly demonstrated that our people are ready for the supreme sacrifice in defense of their motherland and their liberty.\\nI order to expedite the organization of the new Army, I made ad interim appointments to the positions of Chief and Deputy Chief of Staff, the Provost Marshal, and other high ranking officers. These appointments were made after a careful and impartial study of the record of every man and were made upon the recommendation of the Military Adviser of this Government.\\nNo one better than I knows how essential it is to entirely disassociate the Army from politics and, as scrupulously in the rank and file as in the high command, to make merit as the one and only basis of promotion. The Army is a double-edged sword. It is the arm of the Government which is the last resort for the enforcement of the laws and so compel obedience to constituted authority, for the maintenance of peace and order, and for the defense of the national integrity and liberty. But as contemporary history proves to us, the army can also be a disturber of peace and the enemy of law and established government, and in many instances it has been the instrument for the overthrow of constitutional regime. In building up our national defense, and in organizing the regular armed forces of the Islands, these tragic lessons of history must be constantly borne in mind, and it behooves us, who are for the time being entrusted with the responsibility of leadership over our nation, to be forever watchful and vigilant lest we sow the seeds of a possible future misuse of our armed forces. A just and fair treatment for the Army and its rank and file, the upholding of civil authority over the military, insistence upon strict discipline within the organization, non-interference by outsiders, political or otherwise, and a rigid prohibition against the use of the organization or its members for political purposes –these are the basic principles that must be faithfully adhered to in order to make the Philippine Army the safeguard of our liberties and constitutional government, as well as the bulwark of our national integrity and independence.\\nDuring the brief period that I have been at the head of the Government, I have inspected most of the garrisons of the Philippine Army and Constabulary. I know and have known for years many of the officers of the organization and have had intimate relations with the high command. The discipline, the gentlemanly conduct, the devotion to duty, the patriotism and courage of the officers and men make me feel proud as a Filipino and as the Commander-in-Chief of these armed forces of the Commonwealth.\\nThe National Economic Council –Another important legislation which you passed in your inaugural session is that which creates the National Economic Council to advise the Government on economic and financial questions, including the improvement and promotion of industries, diversification of crops and production, tariffs, taxation, and such other matters as may from time to time be submitted so its consideration by the President, and to formulate an economic program based on national independence.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of said Act, I have appointed the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Philippine National Bank, the President of the National Development Company, the President of the Manila Railroad Company, Mr. Joaquin M. Elizalde, Hon. R.J. Fernandez, Mr. Wenceslao Trinidad, Mr. Vicente Madrigal, Hon. Francisco Varona, Mr. Ramon Soriano, Hon. Vicente Singson Encarnacion, Hon. Rafael R. Alunan and Dr. Manuel L. Roxas, as members of the National Economic Council and designated as Chairman thereof the Secretary of Finance. The Council was organized on February 14, 1936, and it commenced to function immediately thereafter.\\nAs may be expected, considering the complex and highly technical character of the task entrusted to it, the National Economic Council has not so far submitted to the Government any economic program, nor has the Government sought the advice of the Council except on one question: namely, the advisability of creating the National Rice and Corn Corporation for the purpose of bringing about the stabilization of the price of rice, the most important staple food of our people, by protecting equally the producer and the consumer, and also to serve as an agency of the Government to meet local or national emergencies in cases of shortage of rice. It should be stated in all candor that it was only after a long debate inspired by honest differences of opinion that the National Economic Council gave its approval to this venture. Despite certain doubts expressed by some members of the Council, however, I am confident that the National Rice and Corn Corporation will ultimately solve the rice problem, one of the most serious national problems which for years has been confronting our country and which demanded immediate attention on account of its very serious implications.\\nThe situation may be summarized as follows: The main food supply of the Filipinos, like that of most Orientals, is rice. For many years the country did not produce a sufficient quantity of rice for its consumption and the Government deemed it necessary even to borrow money for the purpose of establishing irrigation systems in order that the country may be self-sufficient in rice supply. Our yearly importation of this article amounted to many millions of pesos, reaching over P25,000,000 in one year. During the last two years we were able to produce practically all the rice needed for our consumption. But no sooner did we reach this stage than the price of rice went down, in fact so low that the rice farmer not only made no profit, but actually suffered considerable losses. As a consequence, there has been a growing discontent on the part of the rice growers, especially the tenants or kasamas , who are earning less than is required for the bare necessities of life. On the other hand, whenever, due to typhoons, drought, or floods there was a shortage of rice and prices reached high levels, either through the manipulations of a few conscienceless rice merchants or merely because of scarcity of supply, the consumer, especially the poor, became a victim of speculatory activities. To save them the Government had to intervene and take drastic measures at times in order to alleviate the crisis.\\nIn spite of such a situation nothing has been attempted so far to remedy it, and this Administration felt that it was its duty, especially in view of the shortage of the last crop due to repeated typhoons and floods, to face the issue immediately and strive to solve the problem once and for all.\\nIt is only natural that there should be some doubt or fear, and even resentment from some quarters, over the action of the Government; hence criticisms are being made in public and in private, and those who expected to make unreasonable profits from the rice crisis and were foiled in their anticipations, went so far as to see dishonest purposes in the creation of the Rice and Corn Corporation. All such doubts and criticisms, whether honest or malicious, did not deter the Administration from carrying out the plan that has been adopted, especially because no alternative had been suggested.\\nTo meet the national emergency caused by the shortage of rice, I have designated the National Rice and Corn Corpation to act as the relief agency for the Government in place of the Bureau of Commerce which was in charge of this activity in the past. When the corporation started importing rice, the Collector of Customs, believing that the rice so imported must pay duties in view of the fact that it was being sold at some profit, informed the Secretary of Finance of his intention to collect such duties, and in fact did demand payment thereof by the Rice and Corn Corporation. After securing the legal opinion of the Secretary of Justice, I advised the Collector of Customs to desist from collecting any duties from the Rice and Corn Corporation on the rice imported so long as it was acting as the agent of the Government in meeting the emergency resulting from the rice shortage.\\nHeretofore, Government agencies disagreeing on the interpretation of the laws affecting their powers and rights, have been allowed to bring the case before the courts for adjudication. Such a policy, I think, is wrong, and in fact in one instance it has merited the criticism of our own Supreme Court. It makes both government agencies incur in unjustified expense and unnecessarily take up the time of the courts. Considered in its practical aspect, it only means taking money from one agency of the Government and giving it to another. If it had been a question of the Government on the one hand as against a purely private enterprise on the other, then it would have been not only proper but also necessary for the courts to have intervened.\\nThe Court of Appeals –Commonwealth Act No. 3, enacted also during the inaugural session of the Assembly, created the Court of Appeals in order to expedite and improve the administration of justice.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of said Act, I appointed the members of the Court who forthwith proceeded with its organization. These appointments were made after full information and careful consideration, with an eye single to the best interests of the administration of justice.\\nAs soon as funds are available for the purpose, I shall recommend to the Assembly that the necessary appropriation be made for the creation of another division of the Court of Appeals to sit in one of the southern provinces and to authorize the various divisions of the Court of Appeals to sit in any of the provinces within their jurisdiction, to hear cases pending before the Court for decision. Such procedure would not only expedite but would also greatly reduce the cost of appeals to litigants, thus making this appellate Court more accessible to the poor.\\nManila Railroad Company –A very important measure approved by the National Assembly is Commonwealth Act No. 4 providing funds to be loaned to the Manila Railroad Company for the purchase, before maturity, of certain outstanding bonds of the said Company. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, I directed the Insular Treasurer to loan to the Manila Railroad Company P9,900,000, and authorized the Philippine National Bank to use P3,360,000 of its funds in the purchase of said bonds.\\nOn January 29, 1936, upon payment to the Manila Railway Company (1906) Ltd., through the Chase National Bank, New York City, of the sum of $6,698,631.41 covering the principal, interest and exchange premium, all of the Souther Lines 4 per cent gold bonds maturing May 1, 1939, held by the English Company, with par value of P16,340,000, were delivered to the order of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, Washington, D.C., acting as representative of the Commonwealth Government and the Manila Railroad Company.\\nThe successful culmination of this exceedingly important transaction resulted in great financial advantages to the direct benefit of the Manila Railroad Company and indirectly of the Commonwealth Government, which is the sole owner of the property. The following estimates indicate in round figures the savings that will be effected between now and the maturity of the bonds:\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal face value of the bonds held by the Manila Railway Company (1906), Ltd.\\n……………..\\nP16,340,000.00\\n\\n\\nCost at 80 per cent of face value\\n……………..\\n13,072,000.00\\n\\n\\nSavings in principal\\n……………..\\n3,268,000.00\\n\\n\\nLess –premium\\n……………..\\n165,500.00\\n\\n\\nNet saving in principal\\n……………..\\n3,102,500.00\\n\\n\\nNormal 4 per cent annual interest on English Company holdings\\nP653,600.00\\n\\n\\n\\nNormal interest for 1936, 1937, 1938 and half of 1939\\n2,287,600.00\\n\\n\\n\\nPremium for 3-1/2 years at P441,180 each year\\n1,544,130.00——————\\n3,831,730.00—————————–\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n……………..\\nP6,934,230.00\\n\\n\\nLess-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2% on P13,350,000 for 3-1/2 years\\n\\n934,500.00—————————–\\n\\n\\nTotal savings in principal and interest\\n……………..\\nP5,999,730.00================\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above savings on the English Company holdings are based on the principal of the bonds being redeemed at maturity at their face value. However, both the principal and interest are subject, at the holders’ option, to payment in certain European currencies at the former gold equivalent, and if this option should be exercised covering the principal at the time of maturity, the amount necessary to redeem the bonds being held by the English Company would, on the present basis of exchange, represent a total sum of approximately P27,287,800. The purchase of these new bonds at this time for the sum of P13,072,000, therefore, means a saving in interest and principal of about P14,200,000 besides a savings in interest and premium amounting to about P2,900,000 after allowing for the two per cent interest on the loan from the Government, or a total saving of about P17,100,000.\\nThe investment of the Government in the Manila Railroad Company including bonded indebtedness of the Company all told amounts to approximately P28,000,000. This is a respectable sum for any Government and doubly so for a Government whose yearly revenue at present is around P78,000,000 and at its highest peak only reached the total of P92,783,173.70.\\nBus and truck transportation due to improved roads in the northern and central provinces of Luzon have caused a large decline in the income of the Manila Railroad Company. We cannot afford to allow this situation to continue and permit the Government to suffer tremendous losses in railroad operation, for the time might come when the Government would either be compelled to suspend the operation of the Railway or carry a yearly financial burden that sooner or later would bankrupt the National Treasury.\\nThe Manila Railroad was acquired by the Insular Government in 1917 in order partly to withdraw from foreign hands the control of our most important means of transportation at that time. Soon after the Government assumed the administration of this property, the railroad began paying interest on the bonds from its revenue, and even extended some of its lines with its own resources. Only during the last two or three years has the income of the railroad begun to decline due, as already stated, to bus and truck competition. If it should be found advisable, I am prepared to authorize the Manila Railroad Company to purchase some of these competing bus transportation companies or else to have the Government establish and operate its own bus and truck services. The Constitution expressly authorizes the Government to establish and operate means of transportation and communication, and, upon payment of just compensation, transfer to public ownership utilities held by private individuals to be operated by the Government.\\nAnother step that must be taken at once is the completion of the railroad line to the Bicol provinces. This, I am informed, will make the southern lines a paying enterprise. In pursuance of the authority vested in me by law, I have directed the Secretary of Finance to purchase P3,000,000 worth of stocks of the Manila Railroad to finance the completion of the Aloneros-Ragay line. It is my understanding that to complete the road the Government will have to invest only P700,000 more in addition to the P3,000,000 referred to above.\\nBut this amount will have to be greatly increased if the Manila Railroad Company is not given permission to abandon the Legaspi-Tabaco, Las Pinas-Naic, Rosario-Montalban and Batangas-Bauan lines which are absolutely unnecessary from the point of view of public convenience and which, consequently, are causing an annual loss of about P100,000 to the Railroad Company. Once these lines are abandoned their materials and equipment will be used in the construction of the Aloneros-Ragay line.\\nI, therefore, earnestly recommend that a law be enacted authorizing the Manila Railroad Company to abandon the lines above mentioned.\\nGovernment Survey Board –In accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 5, I appointed Hon. Miguel Unson, as Chairman, and Mr. Wenceslao Trinidad and Mr. Jose Paez, as members of the Government Survey Board on February 14, 1936. The Board has been devoting considerable time to the investigation of the Government bureaus and their activities and to the formulation of a plan whereby the Government may be simplified and made more economical as well as more efficient. The most important recommendation of this Board is the creation of the Budget Office, which I have approved, and in accordance therewith I have appointed the Auditor General and the Director of Civil Service, as members of the Commission and the Honorable Serafin Marabut, former Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the National Assembly, as Undersecretary of Finance and Director of the Budget. The budget which I will soon submit to the Assembly has already been prepared by the Commission and approved by the Cabinet. The only other case in which I have exercised the authority granted me by Commonwealth Act No. 5, also upon the recommendation of the Survey Board, is the transfer of the coastguard and lighthouse service from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce to the Bureau of Customs.\\nAt this time the Board is conducting a careful investigation and study of the activities of the Bureau of Lands, General Land Registration Office, Bureaus of Public Works, Science, Animal Industry, Plant Industry and Health, and of the University of the Philippines, with the end in view of avoiding duplication and simplifying procedure. Special attention is being given by the Board to the matter of cadastral surveys, homesteads, a general registration office, a central statistics office, and proper allocation on centralization of laboratories with the purpose of recommending the intensification of industrial researches, so essential to the economic development of our country. Preliminary survey of the provincial and municipal services is likewise under way.\\nPhilippine National Bank –In accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 6, the Philippine National Bank has written up certain assets, heretofore considered as losses, at their actual value. On January 17, 1936, the sum of P3,940,000 was thus written up and paid to the Government, and on May 18, 1936, the sum of P2,944,997 was also written up to be paid to the Government in due course.\\nNational Loan and Investment Board –The National Loan and Investment Board created by Commonwealth Act No. 7 has been constituted by the appointment of Mr. Salvador Lagdameo, as chairman, and of Dr. Luther B. Bewley, Mr. Jose Bernardo, and Mr. Pedro M. Moncayo, as members.\\nThe Board began functioning on February 29, 1936, by adopting measures to organize its office and at the same time granting loans from the different funds placed under its control and administration. Due to the natural delay encountered in making the delimitation of the powers of the National Loan and Investment Board and those of the different boards and offices originally controlling the several investible funds transferred to the former, as well as in transferring the personnel and appointing the necessary new employees, the Board has not as yet been able to completely organize its office and to function as properly as it should. The amount of investible funds, the investment of which has been placed under the administration of the National Loan and Investment Board, aggregates P45,000,000 as of December 31, 1935. The actual transfer of these funds to the National Loan and Investment Board has not yet been completed. It is, however, hoped that such transfer will soon be effected.\\nIt has been found that certain amendments to Commonwealth Act No. 7 are immediately needed in order to clarify some of its provisions.\\nConstruction of Roads in Mindanao –In the exercise of the powers vested in me by Commonwealth Act No. 18, I authorized the expenditure of P820,000 for the completion of the road connecting the Provinces of Lanao, Cotabato and Davao on the Island of Mindanao. As an initial step in the program of giving new impetus to the development of Mindanao, this work will be of incalculable value to the country, since it will not only provide an overland outlet for Davao but will also open to settlement immense unoccupied areas of that island.\\nThe time has come when we should systematically proceed with and bring about the colonization and economic development of Mindanao. A vast and rich territory with its untapped natural resources is a temptation to enterprising nations that are looking for an outlet for their excess population. While no nation has the right to violate the territorial integrity of another nation, people that lack the energy, ability, or desire to make use of the resources which Divine Providence has placed in their hands, afford an excuse for a more energetic and willful people to deprive them of their lawful heritage. If, therefore, we are resolved to conserve Mindanao for ourselves and our posterity, we must bend all our efforts to occupy and develop it and guard against avarice and greed. Its colonization and development will require no little capital. But every cent spent for this purpose will mean increased national wealth and greater national security. The present income of the government is quite insufficient to even attempt to do more than carry on its present activities. Were there no other reasons for the creation of new sources of revenue, the need of developing Mindanao alone would make it an unavoidable duty for this Assembly, especially those who visited Mindanao recently with me, are conscious, I feel sure, of our grave responsibility to encourage settlement and develop Mindanao. There are provinces in Luzon and the Visayas that are already overpopulated. There are localities in some of those provinces where the people live on large estates without opportunity to earn a livelihood sufficient to meet the necessities of civilized life, much less to own the land wherein they live and which they cultivate. It is inconceivable that such a situation should exist in a country with extensive areas of fertile uncultivated lands. I invite you, therefore, to give this matter preferential consideration.\\nThe so-called Moro problem is a thing of the past. We are giving our Mohammedan brethren the best government they have ever had and we are showing them our devoted interest in their welfare and advancement. In turn they are giving us their full cooperation. Let us reserve for them in their respective localities such land of the public domain as they may need for their well-being. Let us, at the same time, place in the unoccupied lands of that region industrious Filipinos from other provinces of the Archipelago, so that they may live together in perfect harmony and brotherhood.\\nPublic Instruction\\nIn order to comply with the provisions of the Constitution concerning public education I feel it my duty to see to it that a careful study be made of the fundamental problems brought about by the conditions now obtaining so that our educational policies and objectives may be re-defined. Our system of public education must be inspired in Filipino patriotism and consecrated to the formation of citizens of high moral character and civic virtues. It must equip our citizens with social and vocational efficiency not only for their own benefit but also so that they may the better serve the State. We must provide every child of school age the opportunity to receive primary instruction.\\nSo that the Government may be advised as to the best method and the necessary means to carry out the reorganization and proper orientation of our public school system, I have created, by executive order, the Council of Education, composed of professional educators drawn from our own Bureau of Education and the Government University as well as from some of the best accredited private institutions of learning. Dr. Rafael Palma, former President of the University of the Philippines, is at the head of the Council. The members are: Hon. Gabriel Manalac, Dr. Francisco Benitez, Dr. Jorge Bocobo, Dr. Luther Bewley, Hon. Norberto Romualdez, Mrs. Sofia R. de Veyra, Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Dr. Manuel L. Carreon, and Mr. Segundo Infantado. I hope that during the present sessions some recommendations of the Council may be submitted to you for appropriate action.\\nCivil Service\\nDuring the last especial session I recommended the enactment of legislation that will make our Civil Service Law conform to the provisions of the Constitution. Lack of time prevented you from taking affirmative action on this subject, and I hereby renew my former recommendation.\\nThe National Language\\nWhile it is my hope and conviction that the English language will remain one of the most generally spoken languages in the Philippines even after independence, nevertheless, we cannot ignore the injunction of the Constitution that we take steps for the formation of a national language based on one of the existing native languages. It is difficult to determine what practical measures may be adopted at this time to bring this about, but I wish to lay the problem before you so that you may give it your early and deliberate consideration. Perhaps a committee may be created to study the question and make recommendations.\\nNew Taxes\\nIn view of the new and greater responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the necessity of having at our disposal funds with which to carry out a comprehensive program for the economic development of the country, it will be necessary to create new taxes. The following are some of the tax measures which I recommend for your approval:\\n1.   The amendment of the Income Tax Law by reducing the personal tax exemption and increasing the rate of the tax on excess personal income and of the tax on corporate profits.\\n2.   The amendment of the Inheritance Tax Law by increasing the rate of the tax, particularly in the case of estates of decedents not leaving any forced heirs.\\n3.   The increase of the tax on mines.\\n4.   Taxes on luxuries and amusements.\\n5.   The creation of a school tax in an amount equal to the present cedula tax, which should be abolished.\\n6.   A tax on transportation and travel in an amount sufficient to take care of the maintenance and improvement of roads.\\n7.   A modification of the Land Tax Law, so as to provide for a progressively increasing rate of taxation based upon the area of the landholdings.\\n8.   Modifications of present tax laws to enable the Government to collect taxes more effectively.\\nThe taxes I am recommending place the burden upon shoulders that can well afford to bear them and, if levied, the Commonwealth Government will be able to render our people new services so urgently needed for their welfare and progress. I feel confident that those who are called upon to pay these taxes will not grudge their added contribution to the public weal.\\nUntil the National Assembly enacts the measure above referred to, it will be futile for me to present for your consideration a program of government activities or industrial development which the Government may initiate or help in part, for there will be no means with which to carry it out.\\nConclusion\\nFrom time to time, during your present session, I shall have occasion to present for your study and consideration matters that, in my opinion, deserve your attention. Meanwhile, may I express the hope that the cordial cooperation which as existed in the last session between the Executive and the Legislative Departments will continue to be keynote of our relations? The success of the Commonwealth will depend upon the ability of the executive and legislative departments to cooperate with each other.\\nIn our day and generation democracy, as an effective system of government, is being challenged. Let this new democracy of ours show to the world that democracy can be as efficient as a dictatorship, without trespassing upon individual liberty and the sacred rights of the people.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>\\nMessage\\nof\\nHis Excellency Manuel L. Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly\\nOn Improvement of Philippine Conditions, Philippine Independence and Relations with American High Commissioner\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the Second Session of the National Assembly, in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on October 18, 1937]\\nMr. Speaker, Gentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nAt no time in ancient or contemporary history has Almighty God showered His blessings upon our beloved country as generously as He has done during this year that is about to close. In a spirit of humility and thankfulness to Him, I come to report to you that the finances of the Government are sounder than they have ever been, that our foreign and internal trade has increased, that more school houses and roads have been built and opened to the people, that public health is in good condition, and that peace and order prevail in every province, city, municipality, and barrio of the Archipelago.\\nIn this year too, as the highest representative of our people, I have taken a step that is of the greatest moment to the Fatherland. In my recent trip abroad I proposed to the President of the United States that he recommend to the Congress the granting of complete independence to the Philippines either on the 30th of December 1938, or the 4th of July, 1939.\\nI feel certain that in making this petition I have expressed the views of the immense majority of our people and that it is better for us to be independent now, that is to say, as soon as the necessary steps could be taken for the orderly process of erecting an independent Republic, rather than in 1946.\\nI can see no valid reason why, if the Philippines can be given independence in 1946, she may not have it in 1938 or 1939. In the short span of seven years the Filipino people can hardly do anything that would substantially change their present situation. Any obstacle which would vitally affect the chances of a successful and lasting independent nationhood in 1939 cannot be overcome by 1946.\\nSo, if we want independence at any cost and are ready to take all the consequences –the dangers as well as the advantages of independent national existence- let us have it no later than 1939. If, however, we are fearful of the possible threats that complete independence may offer to our national security, and we would rather remain under the protecting wing of the United States, then let us leave the final determination of our future to come coming generations and not deceive ourselves with the groundless hope that by 1946 we shall have become politically and economically beyond any serious difficulty.\\nWe cannot be hesitating indefinitely. The best interest, indeed the very life, of the nation is at stake. If it is our resolve to be an independent nation, this is the time, for every year lost is to our evident disadvantage.\\nOur duty –the duty of the Executive and Legislative branches of the government- is plain. Under the Independence Act and the Constitution, the Government of the Commonwealth has been established to prepare the country for complete independence. Our people alone, by their own choice and direction, can command us to take a different course.\\nSince the news of my proposal to have the transition period shortened was published, voices in opposition to it have been heard both in public and in private. Let me say in all earnestness to those Filipinos who believe in good faith that the security, liberty, prosperity, and peace of our common country lie in some kind of political partnership with the United States rather than in complete independence, that they should say so frankly and come out courageously in the open with an alternative plan, instead of merely adopting dilatory tactics in the belief that when the fourth of July, 1946, shall have arrived, some unforeseen event will prevent the establishment of the Philippine Republic. They have nothing to fear: there is here freedom of thought and of speech, and one may be as much a patriot advocating some other political status for the Philippines as favoring complete independence so long as in advocating he is inspired not by selfish motives but by what he honestly believes is for the commonweal. As long as the essentials of freedom are not sacrificed –and they must not be sacrified under any consideration- the formula for securing and enjoying it may well be debated upon.\\nIt is true that from the point of view of a foreigner who does not intend to remain in the Philippines after independence shall have been granted and who is contemplating to liquidate his interests in this country, the remaining seven years may, perhaps, give him the opportunity to withdraw his investments. But, is this a sufficient reason to postpone the grant of independence if, on the other hand, it would be to the best permanent interests of the Filipino people to accelerate its grant? Is the future well-being of a whole nation to be sacrificed for the benefit of a few foreigners? Do these foreigners have any right to a special consideration?\\nFrom the very first day of America’s occupation of the Philippines, she disclaimed any intention to permanently hold these Islands. Neither did she, in thus announcing to the whole world her intentions, ever give any promise either directly or by implication that she would not withdraw her sovereignty from her newly-occupied territory at a moment’s notice. Therefore, foreigners who had investments in the Philippines when the United States took possession of the Islands, as well as those who came thereafter, knew full well that they were not placing themselves under the protection of the American flag except for as long a time only, and no longer, as the Government of the United States decided to retain the Philippines.\\nWith more reason should these foreigners have known that the days of American sovereignty were numbered when, in 1916, the Jones Law was enacted, for it was solemnly and clearly declared in that law that the Philippines would be granted her independence as soon as a stable government could be established in this country. Since the question of the stability of a government is a matter of opinion, and in the case of the Government of the Philippines, the Congress alone has the right to determine the question, that pronouncement in the Jones Law was tantamount to a formal notice to all concerned that the United States might, at any time, leave the Islands to their own fate.\\nIt is true that when the Independence Act was approved by the Congress in 1934, it was specifically provided therein that complete independence would be granted ten years following the inauguration of the Government of the Commonwealth; but the reports of the respective Committees and the speeches delivered upon the floor of both Houses of the Congress clearly show this was not a commitment addressed to foreigners having investments in the Philippines, but only to the Filipino people who, in the opinion of the Congress, might be seriously injured economically if their trade relations with the United States were abruptly terminated. If the Filipino people themselves are willing to have the date for the granting of independence advanced, there is nothing, expressed or implied, in the Independence Law that denies them the right to ask the Congress to shorten the transition period.\\nMy main reason for asking that the independence of the Philippines be granted not later than the 4th of July, 1939, is that I am sincerely of the opinion that it will be to our best interests to secure independence during and under the administration of President Roosevelt. I know the President, his progressive and liberal ideas, his very deep sense of justice, and his friendship for and good will towards the Filipino people. I have no doubt that under his leadership we will receive from the Government of the United States the fairest treatment that we may ever expect to receive under the leadership of his successors. And if the Philippines were to become independent not later than the fourth of July, 1939, President Roosevelt would still have more than one full year to extend his helping hand to the new Philippine Republic in the early stages of its dealings as an independent nation both with the United States and the rest of the world. We could, indeed, find no better sponsor than President Roosevelt to usher the Philippines into the family of free nations.\\nMoreover, the experience of the last two years has shown that, although the avowed purpose of the ten-year transition period is to stabilize the trade relations between the United States and the Philippines, as provided in the Independence Act, so as to give the Filipino people a basis for making readjustments in their national economy preparatory to the change that complete independence would bring with it, there were tendencies in Congress to disregard the terms and conditions governing said trade relations even against the will of the Filipino people.\\nIn proposing to President Roosevelt that he recommend to the Congress the shortening of the period for the grant of independence, I also asked that the present trade relations between the United States and the Philippines be continued for at least ten years after independence. If this were done and made a part of a treaty between the Government of the United States and the Philippine Republic the trade relations between the two countries would have been placed on a stable basis during the life of the treaty.\\nI know that there are people who believe that these trade relations only benefit the Philippines at the expense of the American people. As far as I am concerned, I would never ask from the United States anything that we could not reciprocate in kind. If U advocate the temporary continuance of the present trade relations between America and the Philippines it is because I am convinced that these trade relations are mutually beneficial to both countries.\\nThere is another vital reason why the date for the granting of independence should be advanced. The present political set-up is untenable in that while America retains her sovereign authority over the Philippines, she, at the same time, has placed in the hands of the Filipino people the responsibility for laying down the foundations and erecting the structure of the Philippine Republic. The continuation of her sovereignty over the Philippines imposes upon America obligations she cannot shirk, and, correspondingly, it gives her rights that are incompatible with the free exercise of our judgment as to the best means that we should adopt to prepare ourselves for an independent national existence. Conflicts of views, and perhaps of interests, may arise during the coming next eight years that may create misunderstanding and ill-feelings between the American and Filipino peoples and mar the unprecedented record of perfect cooperation and goodwill between two dissimilar races which Fate has thrown together temporarily. As long as America was the sovereign authority and reserved for herself and exercised full power over, and assumed exclusive responsibility for, the Government of the Philippines, there was no occasion for conflict. Her word was then final in all matters of public policy, and our duty was merely to cooperate with her, as we did cooperate under her authority and direction.\\nUpon the establishment of the Government of the Commonwealth, however, the situation has changed materially. By an Act of Congress, we were given power to create our own government, controlled and managed by us, under a Constitution of our own making. It was the plain purpose of the Congressional enactment that the Filipino people, who were to become automatically independent in 1946, would, during the Commonwealth period, take such steps, as in their opinion would best ensure the stability and success of the Philippine Republic. Yet, the powers granted to the Government of the Commonwealth in the most important and essential functions of government, such as those affecting trarrif, currency, finance, immigration, or those which in any way might involve the international obligations of the United States, etc., were subject to the ultimate approval of, or revocation by, the President of the United States.\\nIt must be recognized, on the one hand, that America cannot, in fairness to herself, concede more governmental powers to the Commonwealth than she has granted without endangering her own interest and peace, nor on the other hand, can the Filipino people assume responsibility for their due preparation for independence with only such limited powers as have been vested in the Commonwealth Government. In this predicament, it were better for America and the Philippines to be independent of each other so that each may be free to act in the furtherance of her own national objectives and interests.\\nWe have been fortunate indeed that so far the representatives of the President of the United States in the Philippines have been men of the highest character and integrity, of broad statesmanship, and of a clear vision of the task entrusted to them. You all know former High Commissioner Frank Murphy. His relations with us, not only as High Commissioner but also as Governor-General, have been very close and most cordial. In both capacities he has rendered permanent service to our people. In my last trip to America he has proven to me that his interest in our liberty and well-being is abiding.\\nThe present United States High Commissioner has been but a few months in our midst. Some of his early acts were misrepresented or misunderstood. For a time there were some misgivings on the part of our people as to his attitude towards them and this Government. But nothing can dispel misunderstandings quicker than personal contact.\\nIt is my pleasure and my duty to report to you –and what I am going to say is no mere gesture of official courtesy, but an honest and straight talk- that I could wish for no better United States High Commissioner in the Philippines than His Excellency, Paul V. McNutt. He measures up to his exalted position, both as an official and as a man. Indeed, it is a very difficult choice to make between Mr. McNutt, the man, and His Excellency, the High Commissioner.\\nSince my return, we have had some difficult problems to settle and I had occasion to appraise the true measure of him who now represents the President of the United States in the Philippines. He deserves our respect and affection. The best spirit of mutual cooperation characterizes our official association, and we have also become good friends. I feel confident that in serving his government and his country, High Commissioner McNutt will be of invaluable help to the Filipino people.\\nHappy and fruitful as our association with the American High Commissioner has been, I must state in all candor that these two short years of the life of the Commonwealth have already revealed some signs of the possibility of a serious conflict between the High Commissioner and the President of the Philippines in the performance of their respective duties even if each were desirous of avoiding such conflict. Perhaps there will always be found a way to arrive at some reasonable compromise as long as President Roosevelt is at the head of the American Government, and if his representative in our country were of the caliber of the two High Commissioners we have had until now; especially if the President of the Philippines understood American psychology and realized America’s difficult situation during this twilight period of our nationhood. But who can foretell what will happen if another President should be in the White House, or a less sympathetic man should represent the President of the United States in the Philippines, or a Filipino President should be one entirely foreign to American ways or one-sided in his views of American-Filipino relations? The only sure remedy to this dangerous situation is to terminate it with the least possible delay.\\nNo better evidence could have been given by President Roosevelt of his deep concern for the future welfare of our people than by the appointment of the Joint Preparatory Committee which is now sitting in conference in our country.\\nThe following statement given out jointly by Mr. Sayre, Assistant Secretary of State, as Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Affairs, and myself on March 18, 1937, gives a complete idea of the reason for, and the object of, the creation of this Committee:\\n“Arrangements are being made for the appointment shortly of a joint preparatory committee of American and Philippine experts. The committee is to study trade relations between the United States and the Philippines and to recommend a program for the adjustment of Philippine national economy. This announcement followed conferences between President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth and the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Affairs, which is acting on behalf of President Roosevelt in the preliminary discussions. Assistant Secretary of State Francis B. Sayre is Chairman of this Committee.\\n“Inasmuch as the Independence Act provides that complete political independence of the Philippines shall become effective on July 4, 1946, and inasmuch as President Quezon has suggested that the date of independence might be advanced to 1938 or 1939, it was agreed that the joint committee of experts would be expected in making its recommendations to consider the bearing which an advancement in the date of independence would have on facilitating or retarding the execution of a program of economic adjustment in the Philippines. It was further agreed that the preferential trade relations between the United States and the Philippines are to be terminated at the earliest practicable date consistent with affording the Philippines a reasonable opportunity to adjust their national economy. Thereafter, it is contemplated that trade relations between the two countries will be regulated in accordance with a reciprocal trade agreement on a non-preferential basis.”\\nThe members of the Joint Committee appointed by the Inter-Departmental Committee with the approval of President Roosevelt and by me are the following:\\nHis Excellency, the United States Ambassador to Turkey, Hon. John Van A. MacMurray, Chairman of the Committee.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Group\\nPhilippine Group\\n\\n\\nJoseph E.

WaringSenior Economist, United States Tariff Commission.\\nManuel Roxas\\nFloor Leader, Minority Party in the National Assembly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBen Dorfman of the United States Tariff Commission and Benito Razon, Economic Adviser to the President, were later on appointed to the Committee as alternates.\\nThis Committee held hearings in Washington, San Francisco, and Manila; and it also visited most of the provinces of the Philippines to secure first-hand information that would be valuable to the members of the Committee in making their report and final recommendation on the task entrusted to them.\\nAfter this Committee shall have submitted its report, it is my purpose to reiterate my petition that the granting of complete independence to the Philippines be advanced either to the 30th of December, 1938, or to the 4th of July, 1939, unless the National Assembly, during its present session, should express a contrary opinion.\\nSocial Justice\\nLet me now turn your attention to our most immediate economic and social problems. The Philippines has undoubtedly made great strides both in the field of politics and of economics during the last three decades. Politically, we have reached the point where we are –having an almost entirely autonomous government and the assurance of complete independence. Economically, we have become an important factor in American commerce; our foreign and domestic trade has multiplied –in a word, the national wealth has greatly increased. We have accomplished, too, considerable progress in sanitation, in education, in the construction of roads and all kinds of communications, and we have acquired the modern conveniences of life. But the main beneficiaries of this most remarkable progress are the rich and the middle class. The rich can live in extravagant luxury. Some of their offspring grow up in an atmosphere of ease, with an outlook on life which gives paramount important to society affairs, vanities, trivialities and material possessions, devoid of discipline, love for work or human sympathy. The middle class have attained a higher standard of living as compared with that prevailing during the Spanish regime. The comforts of present-day civilization are within their reach and they are enjoying them. Their sons and daughters are better-fed, better clothed, better educated –thousands upon thousands of them are now receiving the benefits of higher instruction.\\nSad to tell, but it is none the less true, the same cannot be said of our laboring population. The men and women who till the soil or work in the factories are hardly better off now than they were during the Spanish regime. Of course, wages are higher than in any other Oriental country, with the possible exception of Japan. But it should be remembered that money could buy more in those Spanish days than it can now; and furthermore in the relationship between employer and employee in the days of old there was a consideration of higher value to the employee than the monetary compensation itself. Of yore employers and employees lived in personal contact and association resembling that which exists amongst members of the same family so that ties of affection bound them together much more than material considerations. Now this no longer obtains for their relationship is almost as impersonal and detached as that existing between employers and employees in highly industrialized countries. Again, our ancestors, because of their greater ignorance, knew no better and were resigned to their hard life, believing that it was a part of the world order as decreed by Divine Will, so that the unfortunate sufferer may meet with a greater reward in Heaven.\\nNow the Filipino workingman, however illiterate, refuses to believe that the Creator of the Universe could have ordained that some of His creatures should live in luxury and plenty, while others, in destitution and misery. The Filipino laborer now knows that the Father of mankind loves him as much as every other human being, and, therefore, that the world has not been made for the benefit of a few, but for the happiness of all.\\nStill more: The Filipino workingman has heard, if he is not able to read, of the equality before the law of the poor and the rich. He has heard of democracy, liberty, and justice, since every candidate for an elective office discourses on these topics, painting to him in glowing terms the meaning of these words.\\nAnd yet, what does he actually see? How do these doctrines that he has heard propounded from the platforms affect his everyday life? His hopes have been raised, his vision has been broadened, and his outlook has been painted in bright colors. But thirty-five years of American regime has brought him only disappointments and, sometimes, despair.\\nHas the progress then made by the Philippines benefited our poorer population? Rhe poor still has to drink the same polluted water that his ancestors drank for ages. Malaria, dysentery, and tuberculosis still threaten him and his family at every turn. His children cannot all go to school, or if they do, they cannot even finish the whole primary instruction for one reason or another.\\nRoads from his barrio or his little farm to the town there are none. Only trails are within his reach –trails that have been formed by the daily pressure of his bare feet and not because they have been constructed. As he works from sunrise to sundown, his employer gets richer while he remains poor. He is the easy prey of the heartless usurer because usury is still rampant everywhere despite legislative enactments intended to suppress it.\\nThat is, concisely speaking, the lot of the common man in our midst, after America’s long endeavor to give to all fair opportunity in the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of life.\\nIt was, of course, impossible for American administrators to see and reach the lowest strata of our population. But now that the reins of government are in our hands in so far as our own domestic affairs are concerned, what excuse, what reasonable justification can there be in allowing such a social and economic order to continue?\\nIt is high time that all the branches of this Government cooperate with one another, and with them the whole community and every good-hearted man and woman, so that at last in this dear land of ours social justice –real justice- in the relations of man to man, may reign supreme.\\nOur people are patient and law-abiding. They love peace. They have not lost their faith either in the executive, the legislative, or the judicial branch of the Government. As the Government is now in the hands of their own countrymen, they have become hopeful and are placing the realization of their dream for a better day in our clearer understanding of their lot, our better knowledge of conditions prevailing in the country, and in what should be the natural craving of our hearts to serve them with all the power at our command –they who are flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood.\\nThe promotion of social justice by the State is a clear and categorical mandate of our Constitution. Our platform, the platform upon which you and I have been elected, imposes upon us the high duty of enacting measures that will improve the living conditions of the laborer and of carrying these measures into effect. We must see that laws are enacted which will not permit the exploitation of the employee by his employer and which will leave no loopholes that may be used to defeat the ends of justice. We must rely for the security of this new nation, not so much upon the might of brute force, but upon the undivided loyalty of every citizen to the Government –a loyalty founded upon individual consciousness that this Government is his, and that it exists only for his protection, for his liberty, and for his happiness.\\nBoth the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor are ready to help you in the preparation of the measures that are required to fill the gap that may be found in our existing legislation, for the purpose of correcting prevailing social evils and of carrying into effect the provisions of the Constitution as well as the commitments in our platform.\\nThe Proceeds of the Excise Tax on Oil\\nFortunately for us a new source of income has come to our hands that will facilitate the carrying out of our program of social justice and economic readjustment. From the proceeds of the excise tax on oil there has been accumulated up to the end of June, 1937, the sum of P96,507,227.30 in the Federal Treasury, the transfer of which amount to the Treasury of the Philippines I had secured before I left America on my last trip. This sum is now available for appropriation, the understanding with the Treasury Department of the United States being that out of that fund, P10,000,000 will be available upon thirty days’ notice and the balance upon ninety days’ notice.\\nThe final decision as to how this fund shall be spent is, of course, yours. But in the exercise of my constitutional prerogative I shall take the liberty of making some suggestions regarding the purposes for which this money should be spent.\\nThe first thing that we must bear in mind is that this fund does not constitute an ordinary income of the Government upon which we may depend for recurring obligations. When independence shall have been granted, this source of our income will cease. Were we to defray from this fund services that we cannot maintain once this income is terminated, we would have thrown away the money thus spent. We must, therefore, limit the use of this fund for national objectives, for purposes where the greater good may be derived by the Filipino people.\\nConcretely, I recommend that this fund be devoted to the following purposes:\\n1.   To improve sanitary conditions of centers of population by constructing water systems or artesian wells.\\n2.   For combating malaria where there is assurance that it can be done at a reasonable expense.\\n3.   For the prevention of tuberculosis and the establishment of more sanitoriums, as it is well known that the white plague is the worst scourge afflicting our race.\\n4.   For the building of new leprosariums which will permit lepers in the early stage of the disease to be treated where they may be easily reached by their families, thus making their isolation less tragic.\\n5.   For extending free dispensary service to the poor not only in centers of population but also in outlying barrios and communities.\\n6.   For building public schools in every barrio where there is a sufficient number of children justifying the opening of the school.\\nIn this connection, I desire to state that it was with great reluctance that I vetoed the bill passed in your last sessions appropriating funds for school buildings. A subcommittee of the Committee on Public Instruction came to see me to secure my approval to a measure that would appropriate P5,000,000 for school buildings even before approving the regular budget of the Government. The Department of Public Instruction is now ready to furnish you with all the necessary information.\\nThe Constitution imposes upon the Government of the Philippines the duty to give every boy and girl of school age the opportunity to receive primary instruction. As soon as there are sufficient school buildings to accommodate all the school-age population of the Philippines and permanent means for supporting the schools have been created, there should be implanted here, in my opinion, compulsory universal primary instruction. In the meantime we should make it compulsory for every boy and girl who is now in our public schools, and those who may be admitted next year and thereafter to remain in school during the period required for the entire primary instruction. Means should be immediately provided to carry this policy into effect.\\nOne of the discoveries which we have made since the establishment of the Government of the Commonwealth is that, despite the large number of children that have gone through our public schools, as shown in the reports of the Bureau of Education, the literacy of the Islands has not increased proportionally, and the knowledge of those rudimentary subjects which the citizen of a democracy should have, has not been acquired by a population corresponding to the number of children that appear to have entered the public schools. The reason for this is simple. A large proprtion of the boys and girls who have been admitted to the schools have not remained long enough to acquire any kind of useful knowledge.\\n7.   For opening national highways and helping in the construction of provincial and even barrio roads whenever the respective provinces and municipalities pledge themselves to maintain the roads thus constructed, and in the case of barrio roads, where the volume of traffic on said roads also justifies their construction.\\n8.   For the construction of office buildings for the National Government so as to reduce, if not eliminate, the continuous expense in rents.\\n9.   For the purchase of large landed estates and their resale in small lots to the actual occupants thereof.\\nWe are committed to the policy of acquiring the haciendas which, in the opinion of the Government, should be subdivided in small lots and resold to the tenants actually working on said lots. In a message to the National Assembly in its first regular session, I stated that we were not in a position to redeem this pledge, not only because we had no funds with which to purchase these estates, but also because I feared that we would only be transferring the trouble faced by the owners of these estates to the Government itself. Since then we have come into this fund accruing to the Commonwealth from the processing tax on oil, and I deem it proper and wise to use a part of it for the acquisition of these haciendas. In order that the Government may accomplish its objective more completely this time than when it brought the Friar lands, I have appointed a committee to study the whole question in its varied aspects with instructions to submit it recommendations not later than November 15, 1937. As soon as the committee submits its report, I shall refer the same to the National Assembly for such action as you may deem proper and expedient in the light of the recommendations therein contained.\\n10.                For the development of water power, the reforestation of denuded areas, the colonization and development of Mindanao; and\\n11.                For the financing of a long range program of economic adjustments necessary to prepare the country for the new situation attending the grant of our independence, including the establishment of new industries which at the same time will give work to the unemployed.\\nIt is expected that the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs will include in its report a well considered program of economic adjustments to supplement its recommendation on future American-Philippine trade relations. As soon as this report has been received by me it will be immediately submitted to you for your consideration.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, before closing, allow me to emphasize the need to of giving the common man in the Philippines the benefits that the citizenry of every progressive democracy is entitled to receive. I am sure that every one of you will give to this noble task the best that is in him. An opportunity has been offered us that no past or coming generation has had or will ever have –that of creating a nation where there will be no privileged class, where poverty will be unknown, where every citizen will be duly equipped with the knowledge that will enable him to perform his duties and to exercise his rights properly and conscientiously, and where every man, woman, and child his fireside will be thankful to God for living in this beautiful and blessed land.\\n</td>\n",

Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly\\nOn the Revision of the System of Taxation\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the Third Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 24, 1938]\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nThe state of the nation remains practically the same as reported in my annual message to your Honorable Body at the beginning of your last regular session on the 16th of October, 1937.\\nWe are earnestly concerned with social justice. Without a strict application of social justice to all elements of the community, general satisfaction of the people with their government is impossible to achieve. Here, in the just and equitable solution of social problems, is the real test of the sufficiency of democracy to meet present-day conditions of society.\\nSocial justice involves many and varied questions, such as taxation, wages, land ownership, insurance against accidents and old age, etc.\\nI desire to direct your attention at this time to one subject only—taxation—which we are solemnly committed to revise in order to place the burden upon those who should and can best carry it.\\nTaxation is imposed in the interest of the nation: to keep peace and maintain order; to repel invasion; to prove the living conditions of the people; to educate them; to promote agriculture, industry and trade.\\nThe power to tax may also be used to prevent the accumulation of vast wealth in a few hands. This is not to deny the right of property of the individual, but it is to affirm that this right may be limited by the State when social well-being demands it. The root of the worldwide discontent among peoples, which gave birth to communism in Russia and which has been at the bottom of every revolution of the last forty years, has been the utter disregard by governments of the social purpose of property. Selfish interests have been allowed to dictate government policies affecting social and economic life.\\nIn the past, taxation has not been concerned with principles of justice and rarely has it been concerned with bettering the people. Rather it has sought only to produce revenues and to place the burdens on the backs of those least able to remonstrate. It has done this by taxes on consumption, on sales, on licenses to engage in business, trade or profession, and by excessive charges on services which should be rendered by the Government and for which only a sufficient charge should be made to cover the cost. Those who rule have not paid their share. They have exempted the wealth they owned and the incomes they enjoyed almost wholly from taxation. This has been true throughout the world. It has been true of the Philippines as well.\\nOur tax system, unlike our political system, is still a heritage of earlier centuries, out of harmony with those principles which should guide progressive nations today. The Filipino people have one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. That Constitution is built not only on the principle of political equality but also on the added principle of social justice.\\nIt remains for us to parallel our achievement in the realm of political science by a similar achievement in the realm of economic and social justice.\\nThe present system of taxation in the Philippines is a source of the greatest injustice from which our people suffer. It may properly be said that our burdens of taxation rest most heavily upon the masses, and very lightly upon the rich. Bearing in mind the income of the rich as compared to the earnings of the labouring class, it is a fact that the richer the taxpayer the less he contributes proportionately to the maintenance of the Government. The picture of the distribution of taxes in the Philippines is this: The wage earner and the small farmer as a class carry most of the burden, then comes the middle class, and lastly the upper class. This wealthy upper class constitutes a very small percentage of our population.\\nIn your last session you have done away with the one direct tax which was imposed upon the poor in the same amount as upon the rich— the cedula tax. But even after the elimination of this odious tax which accrued exclusively to the provincial and municipal governments, it is still true that as far as the National Government is concerned, its income comes mostly from customs duties, the tax is ultimately paid by the consumer, and in the case of internal revenue taxes, with very few exceptions, the bulk of the tax is also paid by the consumer. Needless to say, if most of these taxes are paid by the consumer, it is the great mass of the people who are carrying the burden.\\nThe extent to which the Commonwealth is supported by the great mass of the people through taxes on consumption is not generally realized. Taxes on consumption are of necessity taken almost entirely from the poor. These taxes are added to costs as are all other elements of the cost. Thus, in 1936 the total revenue of the National Government, including the customs, amounted to approximately P85,000,000. Of this sum less than P5,000,000 came from direct taxes on incomes while the total taxes paid by inheritances and wealth amounted to less than P1,000,000. Deducting incidental revenues and other earnings, there remained P52,500,000 in the form of indirect consumption taxes on the things the people used , and for the most part had to use. They were in the form of customs taxes, excise taxes, license taxes, sales taxes, and similar charges.\\nThe revenues of the provinces and municipalities, excluding contributions from the National Government, amounted to P46,000,000. Except for such taxes on real estate as are ultimately borne by the owners of the real estate, the great bulk of these taxes were consumption taxes or charges on the living costs of the people.\\nIn other words, approximately P100,000,000 have been taken from fifteen million people not according to their ability to pay but according to their need to exist. This burden is equivalent to possibly P40 per family. And this burden is borne by millions of our people whose total family income is between P100 and P200 a year. There is no escape from the fact that the Commonwealth is supported in large part by those who are already on a low margin of subsistence.\\nIn forty years’ time we have taken from these classes a sum which approximates the accumulated wealth of the entire Philippines, agricultural as well as industrial. Within the past generation these consumption taxes have rebuilt the Commonwealth. They gave us our docks and harbours, our streets and highways, our schools and public buildings. The taxes from the poor have in fact made possible the Commonwealth which we now enjoy. It is their contributions that have given us security. They have paid for our courts of justice. They have preserved our health. They are maintaining our military establishments. They have made the Philippines a safe and comfortable place in which to dwell. It is the centavos of the millions that have created the conditions which have made our industries possible. Almost alone the masses have built the Commonwealth by their sacrifices. This has been going on for more than three hundred years. It is a system which we inherited from Old Europe, in which a few enjoyed all the privileges while the people did the work and also paid for the support of the state.\\nIt is not social justice alone, it is ordinary justice that demands correction of this age-long injustice.\\nWhile in the case of the customs duties, we are not free at this time to introduce radical or even any important change in our laws, we are not placed in the same position with reference to the internal-revenue taxes. We must proceed at once to reduce and, whenever possible, to eliminate altogether, every internal-revenue tax which is passed on ultimately to the consumer, such for instance as the sales tax. The sales tax is not paid by the merchant but by the public who buys the articles for its consumption. The merchants, in paying the sales tax of 11 per cent for every sale that they make, no matter how many times, are only acting as collectors for the Government, and the real person who pays the tax is the last purchaser, the consumer. The sales tax, moreover, is not only unjust to the poor; it also is injurious to the healthy growth of business. There are historian-economists who attribute the ruin of Spanish industries in the sixteenth century to the sales tax. In the United States, the Federal Government imposes no sales tax, and only a certain number of States impose it. But regardless of how other governments secure their revenues, it remains true nevertheless that the sales tax is unfair to the poor and harmful to the business. I, therefore, recommend the amendment of the sales tax law so as to eliminate completely the sales tax on every article that is of prime necessity and leave it only for luxuries, in which case, the tax should be materially increased. However, in no case should the sales tax be cumulative, but rather it should be paid only once at the source.\\nAnother advantage to the Government in the amendment of the sales tax law as suggested is that there can be no evasion of the payment of the tax as in the past. Nor will there be any need for a large number of internal-revenue collectors and inspectors who, in the performance of their duties, are unavoidably causing annoyance and irritation especially among the small merchants. Many small merchants, insufficiently trained to handle complicated accounts, waste time and energy in keeping their sales books in order. I am sure that the relief which thousands and thousands of small merchants all over the Philippines will receive from the abolition of the cumulative sales tax and of any tax on articles of prime necessity, will in itself compensate, in terms of satisfaction with their Government, for the loss, if any, that the treasury may suffer. I believe, too, that it is in part due to the difficulties that the average small Filipino merchant finds in keeping his books and paying his books and paying his sales tax that the retail trade is not largely in Filipino hands. It is my hope and belief that the abolition of the sales tax will encourage and facilitate the entry of more Filipinos with little capital into the retail business.\\nThere are other internal-revenue taxes that should be abolished or amended, such for instance as the license fees on the various professions. It is evidently unfair that a new lawyer or anew doctor should be made to pay the same amount of license as those most experienced and accredited in the profession they are paying. If it is the preference to keep this tax, at least there should be an exemption for those who have not been in the profession more than five years. In order that the Government may have a record of these practicing professionals, they may be compelled to pay only what is necessary to defray the cost of keeping that record.\\nThere are still other taxes on our cultural life that should be repealed or very materially reduced. One of these is the tax on radio sets which should not exceed P1 a year, except in the case of expensive sets which are luxuries. The radio should be available to every family. It is a means of political contact with their Government. It is a carrier of news, by which the people may be informed as to what is going on in the world. Through the radio adult education is possible. Through it, music and drama can be disseminated in every barrio. By means of the radio, police administration is made easier, and property and life made more secure. To tax such an instrument by an almost prohibitive charge to the poor is as indefensible as a prohibitive tax on the daily press.\\nIn the case of the market licenses, I recommend that the National Assembly enact a law prohibiting the municipalities from collecting market and shouse fees in excess of what is necessary to pay for their maintenance and upkeep. If, however, the municipality is still in debt for the construction of its market, it may be permitted, if deemed necessary, to collect higher taxes only until such cost has been fully recovered.\\nThe foregoing recommendations will mean a serious reduction in the income of the Government which we cannot afford to leave uncovered. Fortunately, there are many sources from which we can raise new taxes without causing any injustice to those who will have to pay, for we must see to it that these new taxes are just and fair, that they do not discourage initiative in sound business enterprises. Indeed, my very recommendation that the sales tax and licenses be done away with is in line with our purpose not to allow taxation to retard the proper economic development of the country nor to jeopardize the confidence of business in us.\\nIn your first regular session, you passed an act increasing the rates of our income tax, but the most cursory examination of the income tax paid in the Philippines both by corporations and individuals as compared with the income tax paid in other countries shows that we are practically imposing a nominal income tax. The United States is not the country that imposes the highest income tax, yet as compared with America, the income tax in the Philippines is but a trifle. Following is a comparative statement of the rates of income tax levied in the United States and in the Philippines.\\nCOMPARATIVE TABLES OF INCOME TAXES UNDER THE\\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW AND THE PHILIPPINE\\nINCOME TAX LAW (AS OF 1936)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnited States\\nPhilippines\\n\\n\\nExceeding\\nNot Exceeding\\nBracket\\nRate Per cent\\nTax\\nRate Per cent\\nTax\\n\\n\\nP4000\\nP6000\\nP2000\\n4\\nP80\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6000\\n8000\\n2000\\n5\\n180\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8000\\n10000\\n2000\\n6\\n300\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10000\\n12000\\n2000\\n7\\n440\\n1\\nP20\\n\\n\\n12000\\n14000\\n2000\\n8\\n600\\n1\\n40\\n\\n\\n14000\\n16000\\n2000\\n9\\n780\\n1\\n60\\n\\n\\n16000\\n18000\\n2000\\n11\\n1000\\n1\\n80\\n\\n\\n18000\\n20000\\n2000\\n13\\n1260\\n1\\n100\\n\\n\\n20000\\n22000\\n2000\\n15\\n1560\\n1\\n120\\n\\n\\n22000\\n26000\\n4000\\n17\\n2240\\n1\\n160\\n\\n\\n26000\\n30000\\n4000\\n19\\n3000\\n1\\n200\\n\\n\\n30000\\n32000\\n2000\\n19\\n3380\\n2\\n240\\n\\n\\n32000\\n38000\\n2000\\n21\\n4640\\n2\\n360\\n\\n\\n38000\\n44000\\n2000\\n24\\n6080\\n2\\n480\\n\\n\\n44000\\n50000\\n2000\\n27\\n7700\\n2\\n600\\n\\n\\n50000\\n56000\\n2000\\n31\\n9560\\n3\\n780\\n\\n\\n56000\\n62000\\n2000\\n35\\n11660\\n3\\n960\\n\\n\\n62000\\n68000\\n2000\\n39\\n14000\\n3\\n1140\\n\\n\\n68000\\n70000\\n2000\\n43\\n14860\\n3\\n1200\\n\\n\\n70000\\n74000\\n4000\\n43\\n16580\\n4\\n1360\\n\\n\\n74000\\n80000\\n2000\\n47\\n19400\\n4\\n1600\\n\\n\\n80000\\n90000\\n10000\\n51\\n24500\\n4\\n2000\\n\\n\\n90000\\n100000\\n10000\\n55\\n30000\\n5\\n2500\\n\\n\\n100000\\n110000\\n10000\\n58\\n35800\\n5\\n3000\\n\\n\\n110000\\n140000\\n30000\\n58\\n53200\\n6\\n4800\\n\\n\\n140000\\n150000\\n10000\\n58\\n59200\\n7\\n5500\\n\\n\\n150000\\n170000\\n20000\\n60\\n71000\\n7\\n6900\\n\\n\\n170000\\n200000\\n30000\\n60\\n89000\\n8\\n9300\\n\\n\\n200000\\n230000\\n30000\\n62\\n107600\\n9\\n12000\\n\\n\\n230000\\n250000\\n20000\\n62\\n120000\\n10\\n14000\\n\\n\\n250000\\n260000\\n10000\\n64\\n126400\\n10\\n15000\\n\\n\\n260000\\n300000\\n40000\\n64\\n152000\\n11\\n19400\\n\\n\\n300000\\n360000\\n60000\\n66\\n191600\\n12\\n26600\\n\\n\\n360000\\n400000\\n40000\\n66\\n218000\\n14\\n32200\\n\\n\\n400000\\n420000\\n20000\\n68\\n231000\\n14\\n35000\\n\\n\\n420000\\n480000\\n60000\\n68\\n272400\\n16\\n44600\\n\\n\\n480000\\n500000\\n20000\\n68\\n286000\\n18\\n48200\\n\\n\\n500000\\n540000\\n40000\\n70\\n314000\\n18\\n55400\\n\\n\\n540000\\n600000\\n60000\\n70\\n356000\\n20\\n67400\\n\\n\\n600000\\n750000\\n150000\\n70\\n461000\\n23\\n101900\\n\\n\\n750000\\n1000000\\n250000\\n72\\n641000\\n23\\n159400\\n\\n\\n1000000\\n1400000\\n400000\\n73\\n933000\\n26\\n263400\\n\\n\\n1400000\\n1800000\\n400000\\n73\\n1225000\\n29\\n379400\\n\\n\\n1800000\\n2000000\\n200000\\n73\\n1371000\\n32\\n443400\\n\\n\\n2000000\\n2200000\\n200000\\n74\\n1519000\\n32\\n507400\\n\\n\\n2200000\\n5000000\\n2800000\\n74\\n3591000\\n36\\n1515400\\n\\n\\nOver\\n5000000\\n———-\\n75\\n———-\\n36\\n———-\\n\\n\\n\\nIt should be borne in mind that besides the income tax which corporations and individuals in the United States pay to their Federal Government, they still have to pay income tax to their respective States. In the Philippines, however, the income tax is paid only to the National Government.\\nI advise against raising the income tax in the Philippines to anything near what is being collected in the United States. We are in the formative period of our national economy and we should not discourage the investment of capital. But we must increase the income tax because it is inexcusably low. Moreover, this is the time to adopt the policy of avoiding the accumulation of enormous wealth in a few hands and to force the return of excessive income to the public through the medium of government services supported by these taxes. It is in the case of corporations. Inheritance and income taxes that the Government must bear in mind the need of reverting to the nation large amounts of wealth that may be accumulated in a few hands. From the increase collections accruing to the National Government from the additional income tax that we contemplate imposing, an adequate proportion should be set aside for the provincial and municipal governments.\\nIt is my firm belief that if the recommendations made in this message are carried out by the National Assembly, we shall have gone far in our efforts to lay down the foundations of a nation wherein each citizen will contribute his part in the maintenance of the Government in proportion to his ability or resources. As we reduce the burden that is being unduly placed upon the masses of our people, on the one hand, and give them the wage that they are entitled to earn, on the other, we shall ultimately raise the standard of living as we reduce its cost, and thereby increase the purchasing power of the wage earner.\\nWe are liable to forget the fact that the business of the country does not come from great incomes that a few individuals residing in that country make, but from the earning power of the masses.\\nI hope that this Honorable Body will enact the laws herein recommended early in this session. We have talked enough of social justice. Even the walls have heard our speeches. We have made a good start. We have raised the wages of all government labourers. We have abolished the cedula tax. But we have not done enough. We have only begun. Now we are fully prepared to act and we must act at once, if our people are to continue placing their confidence for the remedy of the social evils which embitter their life entirely in our hands. The last general elections have proven beyond question that the people have wholeheartedly and enthusiastically approved of our avowed policies. The City of Manila, which, like every large city in the world, is usually in the opposition by large majorities, has voted practically for the whole Nacionalista ticket, the election of two councillors from the opposition being purely a vote for the individual rather than for the party to which each belongs. As for the rest of the country, all the newly elected governors are Nacionalistas; only one or two provincial board members and an occasional mayor belong to the opposition.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly: The time to act is now. Deeds and not words is what our people want. We dare not disappoint them.\\n</td>\n",

Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the Second National Assembly\\nOn the the State of the Nation and Important Economic Problems\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the First Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 24, 1939]\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nI take pleasure in congratulating you upon your election to this Second National Assembly, and to you, Mr. Speaker, I wish publicly to express my deep feeling of satisfaction that your distinguished colleagues have elevated you to this position of great responsibility and honor.\\nAs we enter upon the second and last period of my administration, we should once more make public avowal of our objectives and of our firm determination to achieve them.\\nThe Philippines is our country, and we shall make it the home of a free people—not alone politically, but economically as well. And this economic freedom must not be limited to the concept of national self-sufficiency, but must extend to every hamlet and hearth in this land. For of what practical value can the “right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” be to a person, if he does not actually enjoy it and his only freedom consists in the freedom to starve or die?\\nThis then is our ultimate goal: That the political rights vouchsafed to all our people by the Constitution be made real and effective by affording to every person willing to work the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood.\\nThe First National Assembly laid the foundations for the attainment of this goal. It made an enviable record worthy of emulation. Only a visionary could claim that this task can reach fruition during the life of one administration or of even a generation. We have to rebuild our national structure on the solid and permanent foundation of social justice. Laws alone will not do it. We have to fight against prejudices, wrong notions, and outworn customs and traditions. We have to preach the fundamental principles of Christianity, and make them the underlying philosophy of our political and social institutions.\\nThe great work initiated by the First National Assembly with such signal success we have to continue and carry forward. This is the mandate we have received from our people and which we dare not disobey.\\nNo party has ever received such a vote of confidence as the Nationalist Party did at the last general election. Not a single candidate from the minority parties has been elected to this body. The faith and trust which our people have placed in our party in this extraordinary manner demands, in turn, from each of us extreme fidelity and devotion to duty. Not only must we steadfastly forge ahead with our determination to elevate to the topmost the moral, cultural, political, economic, and social conditions of our people, that they may be free from every sort of bondage, but our official acts and deeds should be such as to convince our people of the earnestness and honesty of our aims.\\nAs the head of the State and the leader of our party, I venture to express the hope that the National Assembly will resist every temptation to divide itself into groups or blocs that may tend to weaken our unity of purpose and action. One of the dangers of such division lies in the possibility that the general interests of the nation may be overlooked, at least temporarily, and sacrificed for the benefit of the particular interests represented in the group or bloc. Obviously, one of the reasons why our people did not elect to the Assembly members representing the opposition is because they realize the importance of avoiding waste of time in political bickering in the proceedings of this body in these anxious days when every single energy we can command should be devoted to the difficult task of preparing our nation for an independent existence in an international situation so fraught with danger. Moreover, organized groups or blocs within a party are inconsistent with party responsibility and majority rule.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, with your permission, I shall now proceed to give you a report on the state of the nation and to submit my recommendations regarding measures of first importance which I consider deserving of your prompt attention. From time to time, I shall take the liberty of sending to this body other messages concerning matters which, in my opinion, should be acted upon at this session.\\nDuring the past year the country enjoyed peace and order. There have been conflicts between capital and labor, but without serious consequences. Both the Department of Labor and the Court of Industrial Relations are entitled to commendation for the happy solution of such conflicts. However, we would be closing our eyes to the realities of the situation were we to believe that labor in our country is satisfied with its lot. There is growing unrest and discontent, specially among the farm laborers, not due entirely to the activities of professional agitators and irresponsible so-called labor leaders. Our laborers cannot be easily led astray by agitators when they have no real grievances. The Government is deeply concerned with the well-being of our masses, and it will not cease in its efforts to better their condition until ample justice is secured to them.\\nNew public schools and classes have been opened and the enrollment in the public schools last year was increased by over 243,000. Approximately 18,500 kilometers of roads were in existence at the end of the year, and new wharves and other port facilities have been constructed. Public hospitals have been increased or enlarged, and clinics and dispensaries have been established in many localities. We are making progress in providing the remotest sections of the country with the services of doctors, dentists and nurses, and it is my earnest hope that during the next three years every town will be provided with these services. Sanitary conditions have been improved. We have not had any serious outbreak of epidemics and every threat or danger was effectively checked. An important housing project has been started in the vicinity of Manila to permit wage-earners and low-salaried employees to acquire or build their own homes. Should this project be successful, as I hope it will be, similar projects will be initiated in other communities.\\nGenerally speaking, our national defense program has been carried out as planned, both as to cost and the number of men trained. Two full classes of trainees have now been processed through the instructional cadres and their organization into effective military unit’s proceeds apace. Acquisition of arms, equipment and supplies is in approximate step with the production of tactical units. The Air Corps is steadily evolving into an effective fighting unit, both as to personnel and to equipment.\\nDeserving of special mention is the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio and its progress toward the establishment of a training course calculated to produce a highly trained, loyal and efficient professional leadership for our Army.\\nOne accomplishment of the year toward which effort had been long directed was the separation of the Constabulary from the Army. From the beginning it was realized that law enforcement is not properly a military responsibility. Yet the necessity for using the Constabulary, as it existed in 1935, as the nucleus out of which to establish the Army’s foundation, and the paucity of trained men for key positions had been the causes of the temporary consolidation heretofore existing. In the hope of avoiding wholesale transfers from the Army for police work, the establishment of a State Police from civilian sources was attempted in 1936. When the lack of trained personnel demonstrated that this method could succeed only if large numbers of officers and enlisted men were made available, it was decided, to avoid administrative complications, to separate from the Army the necessary individuals and organize them into a Constabulary. This has been done, and there is every reason to believe that the reconstituted organization will quickly earn a popular respect and prestige equal, and even superior, to the reputation in this regard enjoyed by the organization that existed prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth.\\nAs a final word respecting the Army, I want to urge you, once again, to give to all matters concerning our future security the earnest consideration their fundamental importance deserves. If eternal vigilance is the price of freedom, let us then be ceaselessly vigilant. Our defensive system requires no unusual sacrifice by any individual, but its success depends primarily and almost exclusively upon a unification of the efforts of all toward this common and vital purpose. To attain such unification in a democracy, the military plan must be supported by popular intelligence, confidence, and enthusiasm. It is a special function of Government to see that this confidence is fairly earned and assiduously sustained. To this end let us see to it that every law we pass and every military measure we adopt shall reflect an unselfish and national purpose, that it shall impose injustice on none, and that it shall promote the security and defend the peace, the possessions and the liberty of all.\\nThe business enterprises of the Government, especially the Philippine National Bank and the Cebu Portland Cement Company, were operated at a profit during the past year. The Manila Railroad Company has at long last completed its southern line. The gap which existed for many years between Tayabas and Camarines Sur was connected at a cost of about P2,000,000. This was one of my dreams that have come true. The significance of this achievement will be readily seen when we consider the fact that a daily, comfortable, fast and inexpensive communication service has been established between Manila and the Bicol provinces. At the same time the completion of this southern line means increased earnings for the railroad. The National Rice and Corn Corporation stabilized palay and rice prices at levels which, under the circumstances, properly safeguarded the interests of consumers and producers alike. The National Development Company is completing the construction of certain factories and studying the organization of others, in line with our policy to promote industrial development and provide more opportunities for the employment of labor. It is our policy with regard to many of these new industries merely to do pioneering work and ultimately to transfer them to private ownership and management.\\nOur foreign trade during 1938 suffered a slight reduction, mainly on account of low prices for our export products. It is to be noted, moreover, that our imports increased materially, while our exports decreased in value resulting in larger imports than exports decreased in value, resulting in larger imports than exports. This is an unhealthy condition for a country like the Philippines and every step should be taken to guard against the persistence of this adverse balance of trade. This situation may be due in part to increased purchasing power as a result of the expenditure by the Philippine Government of proceeds of the excise taxes on Philippine products collected in the United States. At the beginning, these remittances were made through the Dollar Exchange Standard Fund which resulted in an increase of circulation. In order to avoid this undesirable effect, the necessary measures have been adopted to effect the transfer of these funds through normal bank exchange transactions, without the necessity of releasing new currency by the National Treasury.\\nTax receipts exceeded budget estimates during the last year. The income from taxation, however, for the year 1938 was P8,076,362.49 below the collections for the year 1937, exclusive of the proceeds of the excise taxes from the United States. This reduction in revenue may be attributed to three causes: (1) the low prices for our agricultural products both for domestic consumption and for export, (2) the stock market slump during the year 1938, and (3) the fact that in 1937 large amounts were collected for taxes due in preceding years. Despite the reduction in the public revenues the fiscal position of the Government remains sound and strong. As the budget which I shall present to the National Assembly will reveal, the expenditures of the Government during the year 1938 were well within the income for that year, with an excess in collections accruing to the general fund over the ordinary expenditures amounting to P12,410,420.21 at the close of the year.\\nThe low prices for our export crops during the past year were a serious blow to a large portion of our population. This emphasizes the necessity that we should endeavor to establish our economy in an ever-growing proportion on the basis of our home market, because export crops must face conditions which are beyond the control of our Government.\\nAs I have already reported to the last National Assembly, the President of the United States, in consultation with me, appointed the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs to study and make recommendations concerning future trade relations between the United States and the Philippines. The Committee has submitted its report and recommendations to the President of the United States and to the President of the Philippines. Copies of this report were furnished to the members of this body. The report will be officially transmitted to the Assembly tomorrow. I commend it to your careful and earnest consideration. President Roosevelt and I have both approved the report and recommendations of the said Committee and it is my understanding that the President will urge the Congress to enact appropriate legislation to carry into effect those recommendations. One of these recommendations is to do away with the restrictions on the expenditure of the proceeds of the excise tax on coconut oil, and another is to bind copra and abaca free of United States duty during the Commonwealth period. While it is not necessary for the National Assembly to pass any legislation effectuating such recommendations until the Congress of the United States has acted thereon, I earnestly recommend that you approve a resolution endorsing the recommendations of the report, so that the Congress of the United States may be informed that, if it should take favorable action on said recommendations, the National Assembly would do likewise. It is my hope that the Congress of the United States will approve legislation putting into effect the recommendations of the report at an early date, in order to place American-Philippine trade relations on a more fair and equitable basis, and to permit the Philippines properly and intelligently to plan its economic adjustment in preparation for independence.\\nIn connection with this matter, I have sent as my special representative to Washington the Honorable Sergio Osmeña. Vice-President of the Philippines, to conduct, with the cooperation of the Resident Commissioner, the necessary negotiations with the Government of the United States. With the authority, they have enlisted the assistance of the Honorable Antonio de las Alas, formerly Secretary of Finance. I am in constant touch with the Vice-President who is keeping me advised of the progress of their work. So difficult and delicate a task could not have been entrusted to better hands.\\nYielding to the wishes of the members of the last National Assembly and of the business community, I agreed to defer action upon my proposals for a tax revision and appointed a Tax Commission to study the matter. The Tax Commission has effected a revision of our internal taxation, taking into consideration the fiscal adequacy of our system of public revenue, a more fair and just allocation of the tax burden, and the need of insuring a more equitable and sound redistribution of wealth. I also instructed the Commission to revise the tax system of our local governments with a view to supplying them with definite sources of revenue and a sufficient income to meet their growing needs. The report of the Tax Commission will be transmitted to you at an early date and I trust that it will receive your favorable attention.\\nI also desire to submit to your consideration the enactment of necessary legislation for the settlement of sparsely populated regions of the Philippines, specially in Mindanao. This is important not only for obvious political reasons and as a means to promote economic development, but also to relieve the acute congestion of population existing in certain agrarian areas. The National Economic Council has recommended a carefully prepared plan to carry out this objective. The plan contemplates a ten-year program aiming at the settlement in these vacant areas of about 500,000 people on selected lands adapted to subsistence farming and the production of certain money crops. This project will require an estimated total outlay of P20,000,000 which may be appropriated from the proceeds of the excise taxes. The report and recommendations of the National Economic Council on this matter will be transmitted to the National Assembly within a few days.\\nAnother problem which demands immediate attention concerns banking and credit, the cost of credit, and credit facilities for commerce, agriculture, and industry. The only institution in the Philippines that grants agricultural credit is the Philippine National Bank, but the limit fixed by law on the amount of the capital and resources of the Bank which may be invested in such credits has already been reached and the Bank is unable to give any more agricultural loans. Credit for capital investment is not available. There is practically no market for industrial bonds. Prevailing rates of interest charged by banks and private money lenders are still high, which fact is a drag upon economic enterprise and business prosperity. The National Economic Council is recommending a reform of our banking structure in order to remedy these evils. The Council proposes the creation of an investment bank for agriculture and industry, to which shall be transferred all the activities of the Philippine National Bank except those exclusively pertaining to commercial banking. The Council also recommends the establishment of a reserve and rediscount institution which will operate precisely in the same manner as the Federal Reserve System in the United States. This will provide a reasonable degree of elasticity and control over the money market and should immediately result in releasing for investment many millions of idle cash now prudently held by the banks as reserves in excess of legal requirements. These proposals will not only insure sufficient credit facilities at reasonable cost, but will, in my opinion, afford credit to small farmers, either directly or through cooperatives, and likewise to large industrial enterprises. Upon the approval of these measures, the Assembly may also consider the wisdom of amending the Usury Law by reducing the maximum rates of interest that can be charged. Considering the importance of credit as an aid to economic enterprise, I request that these proposals, which will be transmitted to you shortly, be given early consideration.\\nOne of the most pressing needs of the Philippines is develop men with the necessary technological training to supply the needs of modern industry and agriculture. There is likewise great need for men who may assume positions of responsibility in the management of business and industry. I believe that the institution which should be principally expected to supply these men is the University of the Philippines. Hence, I have urged the authorities of the University to propose plans for a reorganization of that institution with a view to raising its standards and placing it on the same level with the best institutions of its kind in the world. Pursuant to my request, the Board of Regents has been studying a plan of reforms in that institution and has employed two of the most competent educators of the United States to act as its advisers in that important task. One of the recommendations of the Board of Regents has been studying a plan of reforms in that institution and has employed two of the most competent educators of the United States to act as its advisers in that important task. One of the recommendations of the Board of Regents is the transfer of the University of the Philippines to a new site. This is considered essential in order that University students may be brought under a more strict and wholesome supervision and control, and the proper spirit and atmosphere may be created on the University campus. Moreover, the physical plant of the University must be enlarged and improved, and suitable laboratories provided, if it is to be enabled to grant adequate professional training, specially in science, demanded by present-day progress. Besides being inconveniently located, the actual site of the University is too small to permit of these improvements. The transfer of the College of Medicine will require the construction of a modern hospital on the new site. At any rate, the Philippine General Hospital is no longer adequate to supply the needs of the growing population of Manila, particularly for free patients, and a new hospital is instantly necessary. This transfer of the University will require a considerable outlay, but I believe that the expenditure will be more than justified if we succeed in our efforts to capacitate that institution to supply the Commonwealth with properly trained professional men, business executives, economists, and scientists. Once reorganized and its standards raised, the University of the Philippines would set a mark for private universities to emulate. Fortunately, the present physical plant of the University will not be wasted. The Government is in dire need of buildings to house several offices and the present buildings of the University can be made adequate for that purpose. It would be highly desirable for the National Assembly to act upon the proposed transfer of the University of the Philippines at this session, so that the Government may consider the availability of the buildings of the University in framing its program of construction for government offices.\\nHeretofore, the municipal and city governments have had, by law, the responsibility of maintaining all elementary instruction. But in order that the purpose of the Constitution may be accomplished, it has been necessary for the National Government to assume the burden of supporting the primary schools, leaving to the local governments only the maintenance of intermediate instruction. As regards secondary instruction, I recommend that provincial governments be authorized to spend their funds only for vocational high schools and not for academic high schools, which, beginning with the school year 1940-1941, should be maintained on a self-supporting basis. Vocational high schools, however, should continue to receive adequate national aid.\\nTo properly cope with the problem of public health and sanitation, I desire to recommend the establishment of a Department of Public Health. This is necessary for a more effective coordination of public health administration, the better to insure the protection and care of the health of our people, particularly those in early age. Furthermore, it is desirable that the Department of Public Instruction be placed in a position to devote itself exclusively to the far-reaching problems of education and to give greater impetus to the up building of the character and physique of our youth. The new Department of Public Health should be given administrative supervision over public sanitation, hospitals, asylums, clinics, dispensaries, and other institutions that minister to the health of the people.\\nIn order to effect an orderly and scientific development of our agriculture and to permit the intelligent planning of agricultural production, it is essential that as soon as possible we undertake an agronomical survey of the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture and Commerce has completed the soil survey of several provinces. This work should be supplemented and accelerated. This agronomical survey has been recommended by the National Economic Council and the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs. I request that sufficient funds be appropriated to carry out this survey, which should indicate to the Government and to the people the crops adapted to different sections of the country.\\nAnother recommendation of the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs is the establishment of agricultural experiment and extension stations. This is a project which should merit our immediate consideration, if we wish to stimulate agricultural enterprises and modernize agricultural methods. I recommend the repeal of the present law requiring a 5 per cent contribution by provinces and municipalities to the local agricultural fund. Better results could be obtained by a consolidation of these experiment and extension stations in typical areas than by dispersing them, as at present, and often duplicating the experiments, in each province. I recommend an appropriation from the proceeds of the excise taxes of a sufficient amount to cover the expenses for the establishment and operation of these situations in such localities as may be determined by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Another reason which induces me to make this recommendation is the fact that the finances of local governments are inadequate to support this service and that they cannot continue setting aside such a large portion of their revenues for these stations without jeopardizing other activities imperatively needed by local communities.\\nModern industry and agriculture can not be efficiently operated without the aid of scientific research. This is particularly true in the Philippines where technological science of common knowledge is so far behind other countries. We have secured the advice of a renowned scientist to assist the Government in the establishment of an institution for scientific research. It should serve not only the Government but also private industry and agriculture. I shall submit to the National Assembly appropriate recommendations on this subject as soon as the studies of the National Economic Council and the Department of Agriculture and Commerce are completed.\\nThe National Economic Council has recommended the establishment of an Institute of Nutrition. In order to protect the health and build up the physique of our masses such an institution is necessary. The people need to be educated on the nutritive value of different food products. There are many wholesome and nutritious articles that are consumed in some sections of the country which are unknown in others. It is also necessary t formulate dietary programs scientifically balanced which shall be within the reach of the people of the most modest means. Once the Institute completes its study of the different food products that could be produced abundantly and cheaply in the Philippines, the Department of Agriculture and Commerce could conduct a campaign for the production of national interests, has agreed with our Government that political refugees who desire to come to the Philippines shall not be given visas by American consuls without the previous approval of our Government. We owe it largely to His Excellency, the United States High Commissioner, that the State Department was fully appraised of the situation and that this administrative policy was adopted.\\nAt the last session of the First National Assembly I had occasion to express publicly our indebtedness to High Commissioner McNutt for his unstinted cooperation with our Government. I reiterate those sentiments now. It is, therefore, with a sense of great loss for our people and for me that I have heard of his contemplated return to the United States. If he should find it necessary to resign his present post, we would be deprived of a true friend and a most able collaborator, one whom we need at this most critical period and who would be very hard to replace. But if he must leave us, we wish him to know that he takes with him our affection and gratitude, and our prayer that he may succeed in his future undertakings.\\nTo protect the interests of our people and to repair an injustice done to certain races by existing legislation, we should enact a new immigration law. Under our present immigration law passed by the Congress of the United States, Chinese, Indians, and some other Orientals may not be admitted into the Philippines. Ours is an oriental country, and we are an oriental people. We belong to the same racial stock as some of those excluded by our laws. So long as other foreigners are allowed to immigrate to the Philippines, we should admit, under the same terms and conditions, those coming from oriental countries. To avoid, however, a large influx of immigrants from any one country, we should establish a quota that will be the same for all countries.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, the world in which we live today is an entirely different world from that which we knew only a few years ago. Whereas before the World War, democracy was gaining ground everywhere, mankind is now divided into two great camps—those who believe in democracy and those who feel contempt for it as a completely discredited system of government. By our political education, by our convictions and by our inclinations, we are a democracy. We have established a democratic system of government and the perpetuation of this system will depend upon our ability to convince our people that democracy can be freed from those vices which have destroyed it in some countries, and that it can be made as efficient as any other system of government known to man. It behooves us; therefore, to prove that through a wise use of democratic processes, the welfare and the safety of the people can be promoted, thus contributing our share to the preservation of democracy in the world.\\n</td>\n",

Thank you for your courtesy.\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the members of the Senate; House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo; His Excellency Gabriele Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio and the justices of the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga kababayan.\\nAbout two years ago, I solemnly took my oath as a worker of the national government. I was as inspired to institute real changes for the greater good of the Filipino people, as I was greatly overwhelmed then by the daunting challenges that lay ahead.\\nTwo years later, my solid commitment to directly and decisively address our nation’s collective challenges remains. It has not wavered. In truth, it has even gotten stronger through adversity and the desire to give the people the most we can, within my term in this government.\\nLet me begin by putting it bluntly: the war against illegal drugs is far from over. Where before, the war resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs worth millions of pesos, today, they run [into] billions in peso value. I can only shudder at the harm that those drugs could have caused had they reached the streets of every province, city, municipality, barangay and community throughout the country.\\nThis is why the illegal drugs war will not be sidelined. Instead, it will be as relentless and chilling, if you will, as on the day it began. These drug dealers know fully well that their business is against the law. They know the consequences of their criminal acts, especially when caught in flagrante delicto and they violently resist arrest. They know that illegal drugs waste away lives, dysfunctionalize families, and ruin relationships. They know that once hooked, addicts will die slowly — slow deaths. And yet, they persist in doing what they do, oblivious to the terrible harm that they cause to the people and communities.\\nAnd when illegal drug operations turn nasty and bloody, advocates of human rights lash at—and pillory—our law enforcers and this administration to no end. Sadly, I have yet to hear really howls of protest from the human rights advocates and church leaders against drug-lordism, drug dealing and drug pushing as forceful and vociferous as the ones directed against the alleged errant [law] enforcers in the fight against this social scourge.\\nIf you think that I can be dissuaded from continuing this fight because of [your] demonstrations, your protests, which I find, by the way, misdirected, then you got it all wrong. []\\nYour concern is human rights, mine is human lives. [] The lives of our youth are being wasted and families are destroyed, and all because of the chemicals called shabu, cocaine, cannabis, and heroine.\\nHuman rights to me means giving Filipinos, especially those at the society’s fringes, a decent and dignified future through the social and physical infrastructures necessary to better their lives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lives and freedoms and the hard-earned property of every Filipino whose condition we wish to improve shall be protected from criminals, terrorists, corrupt officials, and traffickers [of] contrabands.\\nYou worry about the present; I am concerned [about] both the present and the future. [] I worry about the future because I know what crimes can do to the youth of this country. If not stopped, crimes can make human cesspools of succeeding generations. I will not allow it to happen. Not during my term.[]\\nTime and again, I have stressed that corruption must stop. [] Corruption is like a leech that it bleeds the government of funds programmed for its infrastructure and other social development projects. It saps the morale or the morale of dedicated and honest government workers.\\nCorruption destroys those who succumb to its temptation and eventually it is the innocent who will suffer and bear its horrible consequences.\\nThe love of money is corrosive. And sadly, the desire to make the easy kind by being imaginative and manipulative, corrupts absolutely. Stolen wealth does not make the thief respectable. Neither will the trappings of wealth mask [nor] cap the stink that thievery exudes. One day, justice will catch up with those who steal government funds. And when that day comes, it will be the public who will have its retribution.\\nWhile we run after those who steal the people’s money, we are also enhancing the government’s delivery of frontline services. I thank Congress for the swift passage of the Ease of Doing Business [Act], [] which is a significant fight against corruption and improving service delivery. We need to sustain our momentum. And I hereby direct all [local] government units — makinig sana kayo — and government agencies to faithfully implement this law and simply simplify the process. Hinihingi ko ho ‘yan sa lahat nasa gobyerno under my control and supervision. Huwag ho kayong magkamali.\\nI particularly call the attention of the agencies with the [most] number of red tape-related reports from the public, make your services truly customer-friendly. Our people deserve efficient, effective, and responsive government services. They deserve nothing less. [] Kayo lang ang ayaw eh. Gusto ng tao kayo ‘yung binabayaran, make your living from the pockets of the people, and you have a lousy and corrupt bureaucracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have friends and political supporters whom I appointed to public office and then dismissed or caused to resign. I need not mention their names or recount the circumstances surrounding their removal or resignation. Media has more than amply reported that.\\nI value friendship, make no mistake about it. But it has its limits.\\nThis is a lonely place I am hemmed in. Do not make it lonelier by forcing me to end our friendship because you gave me the reason to end it. It pains me to end — the loss of friendships. And that is why I appeal to you to help me in my cause so that our friendship will endure.\\nFor as long as I can remember, the bulk of the income generated in Mindanao used to be remitted to what we, in Mindanao, refer [to] as the “Imperial Manila” to fund national projects primarily in the Metro Manila area, leaving a pittance to Mindanao as its share thereof. Mindanao was dubbed as “The Land of Promise,” and Mindanaoans say in derision that this is so because what it got from the government through the years were promises, promises and more promises.\\nWe aim to rectify that derisive observation and, as a matter of fact, we are now in the process of fulfilling that promise through significant increases in the budget for Mindanao. At the end of my term, I hope to see the promise of Mindanao fulfilled, or at the very least, approaching fulfillment.\\nBe that as it may, Mindanao pauses at the crossroads of history. One road leads to harmony and peace; the other, to war and human suffering.\\nDespite all that has been said [for] or against the Bangsamoro Organic Law by all sectoral groups, I make this solemn commitment that this administration will never deny our Muslim brothers and sisters the basic legal tools to chart their own destiny within the Constitutional framework of our country.\\nWhen the approved version is transmitted and received by my office… The law has been passed actually and I intend to… Give me 48 hours to sign it and ratify the law. [] Babasahin ko pa bago ko pipirmahan. Baka may isiningit kayo diyan na hindi maganda para sa — para sa ibang tao.\\nWe will need loads of understanding and patience to endure and overcome the birth pangs or pains of the new beginning. To me, war is not an option. We have been through the catastrophe in Marawi. We have seen the horror, the devastation, and the human toll and the displacement of both Christians and Muslims alike.\\nI have made a pledge that ISIS terrorists or groups or its allies will never gain foothold in our country. Yet, when what remained of the decimated Maute-ISIS group in Marawi finally saw the error of their ways and expressed their desire to be reintegrated into society, we welcomed them with open arms and embarked on genuine efforts to embrace a peaceful, productive life for them. We owe it to our fallen soldiers and police officers in Marawi and elsewhere to put an end to the bloodshed and seek the path of true peace—a peace that will last beyond this lifetime, and whose dividends our children will reap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn international relations, we shall continue to assert and pursue an independent foreign policy. Our long-term national development and national security goals come first.\\nWe shall continue to reach out to all nations regardless of their prevailing political persuasions or proximity to or distance from our shores so long as these nations wish us well.\\nOur stronger bonds with our ASEAN friends have made possible our trilateral border patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia, which has since then put out of business sea pirates, piracy and other terrorists who used to infest our shared seas. This is a testament to the readiness of our country and our good neighbors to make regional peace and security our shared responsibility.\\nWe have successfully hosted the 50th ASEAN Anniversary and the 31st ASEAN Summit last November 2017. We have shown the world what we are capable of when we work together. The ASEAN events showcased not only the world-renowned Filipino hospitality and organizational capabilities but also our artistic talent. I would like to commend the [ASEAN National] Organizing Council led by no less than my Executive Secretary, Salvador Medialdea. []\\nOur re-energized relations with China has also led to an unprecedented level of cooperation between our nations on the war against transnational crimes. Our shared intelligence led to the discovery and dismantling of the clandestine shabu laboratories and the arrest of Chinese chemists [connected] with the Dragon organization called Wu Syndicate.\\nOur improved relationship with China, however, does not mean that we will waver in our commitment to defend our interests in the West Philippine Sea.[] This is why we engage China through bilateral and multilateral platforms such as the ASEAN-China and the Philippines- China Bilateral Consultation Mechanism.\\nOpening lines of communication and amicably managing differences have led to positive developments that include renewed access of Filipino fishermen in the areas in dispute in the Philippines — West Philippine Sea.\\nParticipation in the ASEAN-China dialogue has also resulted to the draft framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea which intends to resolve disputes by peaceful means.\\nWe admire our Filipino migrant workers for their selflessness and courage in enduring the hardships of living away from home to provide for their families. You epitomize the innate resilience of the nation. You have shown your willingness to toil and sacrifice day-in and day-out, for the long-term good of your family and loved ones. You have also contributed greatly to the national economy, even as you help in small and big ways to the economies of our international partners.\\nThis is why we strongly condemn the deaths and abuses experienced by Filipino migrant workers in the hands of their foreign employers. I have said this before and I say it again: I am a worker of government, and it is my vow to make sure that your well-being remains our foremost foreign policy concern. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is for this reason that we are continuing to work with the host nations to ensure the welfare of our countrymen. I appeal to all host governments to help us, as true and dependable partners, in this endeavor.\\nI have always believed that no matter how well-intentioned a leader is, no matter how well- conceived may be his mission, if he lacks the political will to do what needs to be done, then he can only end up a failure and a hopeless dreamer.\\nAs a worker of government, I promised to do whatever it would take to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, fighting powerful interests and making sacrifices. My obligation is to promote and uphold the greatest good, for the greatest number. []\\nOur campaign against Endo has resulted in the regularization of more than 300,000 workers as of early this month. On May 1 of this year, I signed Executive Order 51, which sought to protect the workers right to security of tenure.\\nRead my lips, I understand that this does not satisfy all sectors. I share their sentiment; I truly do. Much as I would like to do the impossible, that power is not vested upon me by the Constitution. And neither will I make both ends meet even if I violate the laws to achieve that purpose. Simply, it is not part of my territory.\\nThat is why I add mine to their voices in asking Congress to pass legislation ending the practice of contractualization once and for all. []\\nOur farmers, especially our coconut farmers, form a significant part of the basic sectors of society. It is from the toil of their hands that we put food on the table. It is my hope that we finally see this through. I urge you Congress to convene the [bicameral] conference committee and pass at the soonest possible time the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund. [] I pray that you will do it.\\nMy administration remains firm in its resolve to ensure that the country’s telecommunications services are reliable, inexpensive and secure. A draft Terms of Reference for the entry of a new, major industry player is at hand. The terms will be fair, reasonable and comprehensive. It will be inclusive so it will be open to all interested private parties, both foreign and local. The only condition is that the chosen entity must provide the best possible services at reasonably accessible prices.\\nHowever, our efforts to usher in a new major player shall be rendered futile if we do not improve its odds of success in an industry that has long been dominated by a well-entrenched duopoly.\\nWe shall, therefore, lower interconnection rates between all industry players. Not only to lessen the cost to the consumers as it will also lower the costs [for the] incoming player to access existing networks, [thereby creating] a market environment that is more conducive to competition. This is a policy which is crucial to ensure that our solution to our telecommunication problems will be both meaningful and lasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the last 2 years, experience has taught me that lack of consultation or insufficiency of information can, at times, lead to rash judgments. If and when I am unsure on the most appropriate course of action to take given the problem, it’s factual milieu and the desired end, I never fail to consult to discuss options with persons whom I trust and whose advice I value.\\nWhen I decided to establish Malasakit Centers in Cebu, Tacloban and Iloilo, my long-time aide, Bong Go and his team became instrumental in arriving at the right decision through proper consultations. []\\nDeliberations with the proper agencies also made me decide to push for, and eventually approve, both the [free] Tertiary Education Act and the increase in the salary of our men in uniform, our soldiers and our policemen. []\\nBoracay Island, widely regarded as one of our country’s treasures and admired worldwide for its natural beauty, has sadly become the representation of the government’s negligence, including mine.\\nI could not allow this decay to continue; decisive action has long been overdue. Recognizing that we are mere stewards of our natural resources, and I said enough is enough.\\nWe intend to restore its environmental integrity, alongside measures to alleviate those whose livelihood were momentarily affected. Environmental protection and ensuring the health of our people cannot be overemphasized; thus, our actions in Boracay mark the beginning of a new national effort.\\nThis is just [the beginning]. For the other tourist destinations needing urgent rehabilitation and enforcement of environmental and other laws shall soon follow. I urge our local government units to proactively enforce our laws and not wait for us to swoop down on your areas just to do your duty and work. [] At some other time, I would have to discuss sa local government units.\\nWhat has happened to Boracay is just an indication of the long-overdue need to rationalize, in a holistic and sustainable manner, the utilization, management, and development of our lands. I therefore urge the Senate to urgently pass the National Land Use Act [] to put in place a national land use policy that will address our competing land requirements for food, housing, businesses, and environmental conservation. We need to do this now.\\nTo help safeguard the present and the future generations, we have to earnestly undertake initiatives to reduce our vulnerabilities to natural hazards, and bolster our resilience to the impact of natural disasters and climate change.\\nAs I had stated last year, we must learn from the experiences from the Super-typhoon Yolanda, and other mega disasters, and from global best practices. We need a truly empowered department characterized by a unity of command, science-based approach and full-time focus on natural hazards and disasters, and the wherewithal to take charge of the disaster risk reduction; preparedness and response; with better recovery and faster rehabilitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHence, we, in the Cabinet, have approved for immediate endorsement to Congress the passage of a law creating the “Department of Disaster Management,”[] an inter- agency — just like FEMA. Well, I don’t know if it’s — it’s an effective agency in the United’s government.\\nAn inter-agency crafted and a high-priority measure aimed at genuinely strengthening our country’s capacity for [resilience] to natural disasters. I fervently appeal to Congress to pass this bill with utmost urgency. Our people’s safety requirements cannot wait.\\nOurs is a rich and beautiful country, indeed. Add to that a great number of people equipped with technical expertise and professionalism, and you have a country poised to soar and take its place among the world’s economic and financial eagles. God willing. Inshallah.\\nNature endowed us with this wealth to be tapped for the benefit of all generations. My policy in the utilization of these resources is non-negotiable: the protection of the environment must be top priority [] and extracted resources must be used for the benefit of the Filipino people, [] not just a select few. Do not just give me taxes. I can get it from other sources. Give me what needs to be given to my countrymen. []\\nTo the mining industry, I say this once again and maybe for the last time, do not destroy the environment or compromise our resources; repair what you have mismanaged. Try to change [your] management radically because this time you will have restrictive policies. The prohibition of open pit mining is one. []It is destroying my country. It is destroying the environment. It will destroy the world of tomorrow for our children. []\\nAgain, I warn irresponsible miners, along with their patrons, to stop destroying our watersheds, recharge areas, forests, and aquatic resources. You can no longer fish in our rivers. It’s all contaminated. And the color is not even brown or white, it’s black. You want to see it? I will invite you. We can go to Diwalwal and the other mining areas. And I’m sure you will puke with what is happening to this country. Expect reforms, radical ones. I do not intend to quarrel with anybody, with the moneyed, but for as long as I am here I said: you will just have to contend with me.\\nI expect you to do your part in ensuring our nation’s sustainable development, starting now.\\nI exhort all concerned agencies and local government units to uphold the concept of inter- generational responsibility in [the exploration] and utilization of our mineral wealth, the protection and preservation of our biodiversity, anchored on the right to a balanced and healthy ecology.\\nI applaud Congress for the timely passage of the TRAIN law. You have made funds available to build better roads and bridges, and improve health and education, and strengthen our safety and security. Some have incorrectly blamed our efforts toward a fairer tax system for all the price increases in the past months, and some irresponsibly suggesting to stop TRAIN’s implementation. We cannot and should not. We need this for sustainable growth that leaves no Filipino left behind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTRAIN is already helping poor families and senior citizens cope up with rising prices. We have distributed unconditional cash transfers to 4 million people, and we will help 6 million more this year.\\nFollowing the one-peso discount per liter in gas stations, we have also started releasing fuel vouchers to public utility jeeps and other valid franchises. Further, we have fast-tracked the distribution of NFA rice to provide affordable rice for all. [Excuse me.]\\nThis year, we are giving 149 billion pesos worth of subsidies to the poor and vulnerable. Next year, the amount will be increased to 169 billion pesos.\\nBut no amount of subsidy can help the poor if some businesses take advantage of the situation to make more money. I ask businesses to cooperate with us in charging a fair price.\\nTo help stabilize rice prices, we also need to address the issue of artificial rice shortage. I now ask all the rice hoarders, cartels and their protectors, you know that I know who you are: stop messing with the people. I hate to… Power sometimes is not a good thing. But I hope I will not have to use it against you.\\nConsider yourselves warned; mend your ways now or the full force of the State shall be brought to bear upon you. I am directing all intelligence agencies to unmask the perpetrators of this economic sabotage and our law enforcement agencies to bring them to justice.\\nWe are also working on long-term solutions. On top of this agenda to lower the price of rice. We need to switch from the current quota system in importing rice to a tariff system where rice can be imported more freely. This will give us additional resources for our farmers, reduce the price of rice by up to 7 pesos per kilo, and lower inflation significantly. I ask Congress to prioritize this crucial reform, which I have certified as urgent today.\\nAlam mo, ako humihingi talaga ng tulong. Business is really for profit I understand that. But the Philippines has always been a playground for, you know, scoundrels and those who do it without really considering the plight of the others. It’s all conscience.\\nWhen I ran for public office, I promised to do whatever it takes to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, even if it means fighting powerful interests. I am committed to a comprehensive tax reform, and I ask Congress to continue the job.\\nPackage 2 will lower corporate income taxes, especially for our small businesses. Lower taxes mean they will have more money to invest and create more jobs. More than 99 percent of our businesses are micro, small, or medium enterprises (MSME) and employ around 65 percent of our workers. The enactment of the Package 2 is what stands between today and millions of jobs in the near future.\\nCongressmen Cua, Gonzales, Abu, and Garin and Batocabe, as well as the Suansing family, filed versions of Package 2 last March 2018. Salamat po [] and I support their push to shepherd the bill. I hope the Senate will follow suit, maybe tomorrow, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis matter is urgent. Do not be part of the problem by ignoring it. I hope to sign Package 2 before the year ends. I urge Congress to pass it in a form that satisfies our goals and serves [] the interests of the many, not just the wealthy few.\\nBy the end of July 2018, all 5 packages of my tax reform would have been submitted to Congress. Apart from TRAIN, rice tariffication, and Package 2, they include the mining, alcohol, and tobacco tax increase, reform in property valuation, reform in capital income and financial taxes, and an amnesty program.\\nI urge Congress to take them seriously and pass them in succession, for there is no chance that we can deliver our promises without an equitable tax system.\\nOne of the most important thrusts of this administration’s medium-term development plan is to cover all Filipinos against financial health risks. That is why I have directed concerned agencies to streamline the various sources of financial assistance for people with health-related needs.\\nWe are currently institutionalizing the unified implementation of the “No Balance Billing Policy” [] through which the government and our private healthcare providers can work out a system that will provide an order of charging of medical expenses.\\nMuch needs to be done to improve our healthcare system, which remains highly fragmented, resulting in disparity in health outcomes between the rich and the poor in the urban areas and rural. While investments in health have increased over the years, several policy and operational bottlenecks have constrained universal health care for this country.\\nWe shall pool all our resources for health services under the [PhilHealth]; institutionalize primary care as a prerequisite to access higher level of healthcare; and supplement human resource gaps of the LGUs through a National Health Workforce Support System.\\nThese will ensure that every Filipino [family] gets the appropriate, affordable, and quality health services in appropriate facilities and will be protected from financial burden due to sickness.\\nTo this end, I urge the speedy passage of the Universal Health Care Bill authored by Former Representative Harry Roque. [] Strong political determination, not political ambition, is the guiding light. []\\nI have no illusions of occupying this office one day longer than what the Constitution under which I was elected permits; or under whatever Constitution there might be.\\nFour administrations before me have tried to amend the Constitution to be able to introduce amendments and reservations to the charter — revisions rather to the charter. But none of them has successfully done for one reason or another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI therefore consider it a distinct honor and privilege to have received earlier from the Consultative Committee that I created, the draft Federal Constitution that will truly embody the ideals and aspirations of all the Filipino people. []\\nI thank all the members of the Committee, especially those who came out from their retirement, for their valuable services in crafting this draft Federal Constitution. I would like to extend my particular gratitude to Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno [] and Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.[]\\nI am confident that the Filipino people will stand behind us as we introduce this new fundamental law that will not only strengthen our democratic institutions, but will also create an environment where every Filipino—regardless of social status, religion, or ideology—will have an equal opportunity to grow and create a future that he or she can proudly bequeath to the succeeding generations.\\nMy countrymen, I will not bore you with a litany of this administration’s projects completed otherwise in the process. That would be too self-serving. I have instead caused to be prepared a written report on what has — what was and what has been done in the months and probably in the years to come. The reports shall be made available within the next few days.\\nI was informed that satellite facilities were set up by the Presidential Communications Operations Office in certain far flung barangays so as of today the residents of these communities can watch the State of the Nation and for the first time see you on TV. I hope you have enjoyed the experience. []\\nIn ending, may I quote — I have always quoted but — in my previous talks. One American that I salute, the great Abraham Lincoln. And this has been — I’ve been in government for the last… If I completed my… If I complete my term, Inshallah, God willing, I would have served government for 40 years.\\nAnd I came across this statement which has been with me since I was a fiscal in the 70s. And he said: If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop, the presidency, might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is — what has been said against me won’t amount to anything. But if the end brings me out wrong, ten angels of God swearing that I was right would make no difference.\\nDaghang salamat ka ninyong tanan. []\\n— END —\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

Kindly sit down. Kumusta po kayo?\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, magandang hapon po sa inyo — sa iyo, ma’am, [] kung nasaan ka; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito, [] Macapagal- Arroyo []; His Excellency Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the other members of the Cabinet; Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga mahal kong kababayan.\\nLet me begin by extending my hand in gratitude to all who kept faith with me in our most trying times. Numbers speak a thousand words and tell a hundred tales. But the landslide victory of the Administration candidates as well as the latest survey results shows that my disapproval rating is 3%. [] I hope that the members of Congress — sana hindi kayo included sa 3% [] — inspires me with determination to pursue relentlessly what we have started at the start of my administration.\\nFew men imbued with the will and the courage to do what he believes is right and just and whatever be the opposition in terms of numbers and noise, makes a majority. For it is not the eagle in the fight but the fight in the eagle that matters. [] Believe me, I will end my term fighting.\\nIt has been three years since I took my oath of office, and it pains me to say that we have not learned our lesson. The illegal drug problem persists. Corruption continues and emasculates the courage we need to sustain our moral recovery initiatives.\\nYears ago, we saw the terrible devastation caused by illegal drugs. On May 23, 2017, our law enforcers launched an operation to serve a warrant and to neutralize terrorists. A group of armed men with sophisticated weaponry and aided by locals radicalized by extremist dogma and teachings fought our troops for weeks. During that Marawi Siege, tons of shabu worth millions and millions of pesos. Drug money killed 175 and wounded [2,101] of my soldiers and policemen in that five-month battle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am aware that we still have a long way to go in our fight against this social menace. Let the reason why I advocate the imposition of the death penalty for crimes related to illegal drugs. Our citizens have begun to do their part in the war against drugs, and through the barangay formation of anti-drug councils, and also actually surrendering bricks of cocaine found floating in the sea into our islands. I call this responsibility. However, the drugs will not be crushed unless we continue to eliminate corruption that allows this social monster to survive.\\nI respectfully request Congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes [] related to drugs, as well as plunder.\\nMy countrymen, it is a sad commentary that we cannot distinguish our need from our greed, our principles from our prejudices, the real from the fake, and the truth from a lie. The reason is because that many of us, what matters above all is the “self.” It is selfishness [at] its worst for no purpose other than personal aggrandizement.\\nTo borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have not risen above and beyond the parochial interests. Our warped loyalty to family, friends and tribal kin continue to exact a heavy toll on our programs designed to uplift the poor and reassure our investors, our foreign investors local, and the business sector in this country.\\nThe recent uncovering of the massive fraud perpetrated against the public health insurance system proves that corruption is pervasive. Huge amounts of medical funds were released to cover padded medical claims and imaginary treatment of ghost patients. I am grossly disappointed. The government is conned of millions of pesos which could be used to treat illnesses and possibly save the lives of many. Thus I ordered the NBI to arrest and cause the prosecution of those liable. I appointed a new PhilHealth President, whom I know is a man of integrity, a military man, a former military officer, and gave him marching orders to prioritize ridding the agency of corruption.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the way, I commend the Bureau of Investigation for its handling of high profile cases resulting in the arrest and prosecution of criminals. These culprits will have their day of reckoning in court. I hope it happens during the last three years of my term.\\nConcerning the unscrupulous persons manning our ports and scalawags in uniform, we have been unyielding in our reforms to weed them out of public service.\\nI have fired or caused the resignation of more than a hundred officials and appointees of government without regard to relationship, friendship and alliance. There is no sacred cow, as the saying goes, in my Administration.\\nInstitutions that are the stewards of our resources and agents of development have long been a major source of public frustration. Drastic reforms within these agencies have yielded results. Our government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), infamous for high salaries and bonuses being paid their executives and employees, have started to shape up. As of July 9, 2019, we collected more than P61 billion from GOCCs or government corporations, 32% of which, or P16 billion, from PAGCOR. [] This is more than the P36 billion collected in 2017. My salute to Andrea Domingo. [] Magpasugal ka pa, ma’am, nang marami. [] Bureau of Customs, though corruption-ridden, managed to collect Five Hundred Eighty Five Billion Pesos (P585,000,000,000) in 2018. Imagine how much more could have been collected had the BOC been clean and less corrupt.\\nMay I cut and just — magsalita lang ako kung anong sa isip ko. I went to the Bureau of Customs two weeks ago and found out that there were about 63 of them facing charges, criminal charges, and 61 of them under investigation. I hope that I can have the cooperation of Congress if we cannot abolish their position. And if I cannot dismiss them for the reason that there is a security of tenure, I will just allow them to have their plantilla positions but they have to report to Congress everyday to help me in the huge paperwork that we have to do everyday. All of them will go out from the premises of the Customs area. [] I do not want them back.\\nWe, in government, talk too much, act too little, and too slow. I recall saying that before the Congressional hearing when I was Mayor of Davao City. I say that again to emphasize how little we have changed since then. We are long on rhetorics but short on accomplishments. It’s either you Congress or — even the Executive department and maybe me. So I am here to rectify my own error.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is why, I implore those who occupy positions of power and authority, to let your deeds and accomplishments do the talking. Lead by example. Words ring hollow when not followed by positive and prioritized action.\\nTime and again, I have emphasized that like my fellow workers in government, trabahante lang po ako ng Pilipino.\\nLast year, I assign — I signed the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, a significant piece of legislation to improve service delivery and fight corruption, still until now.\\nHowever, much [has] to be done in ensuring our responsiveness to the people’s needs. Based on complaints received by the Contact Center [ng] Bayan, Contact Center [ng] Bayan – — that’s in my office — the LTO, SSS, BIR, LRA, and PAG-IBIG are the top five agencies that need to drastically improve their service.\\nI reiterate my government — my directive to the government and instrumentalities, including the LGUs and the government corporations: simplify. May I… Nandito ba kayo? Simplify. Just like the others. You can do it electronically. You do not have to go to the office.\\nI’ve been asking that from you since three years ago. ‘Pag hindi pa ninyo nagawa ‘yan ngayon, papatayin ko talaga kayo. [] Nabubwisit na…\\nSimplify and make your services responsive to — client-friendly. Your client is the Filipino, our employer — from where the money in our pockets come from, from our salaries.\\nThanks to Executive Secretary Medialdea, we have increased the number of lines [for] Hotline 8888 to make it more responsive to the public. Our ultimate goal is for our people to be freed from using these hotlines because government service and response have markedly improved.\\nAgain, I will… Ang problema kasi ng Fili — I’m addressing now to the Filipino. Kayo rin kasi sinasabi ko na sa inyo, be assertive. At ‘pag kayo o ikaw hiningian more than the required payment by government at humingi pa sa iyo, I’ve been telling you mag-eskandalo kayo sa opisina. Make a scene. Sampalin mo ‘yang p***** i** na ‘yan. [] Kasi aabot rin sa akin ‘yan. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I have done that. Ako mag-prangka ako sa inyo, ako lang ang Presidente na hanggang ngayon nagbubugbog talaga ng tao diyan sa loob ng Malacañan.\\nPinapakain ko ng pera ‘yang mga y*** na ‘yan. Eh galit na ako sa inyo eh. Kindly be assertive. Pagka hiningian ka, sabihin mo, “T*** *** mo. Sabi ni Duterte, the President told us, that if you extort money from me, I will slap you.”\\nAt sampalin talaga ninyo. Hindi na bale magkaaway. I will defend you. At kung maaari and this is what I’ve been doing all along. There’s an [8888]. Be sure that it is true. Though you are not liable for libel pero huwag naman ‘yang makasakit ka ng kapwa-tao na wala namang kasalanan. [8888], then place “To President Duterte, re: abuses by the director asking for money.” Text mo, lalabas ‘yan diyan. And that is for the public to view.\\nAt kung totoo, Malacañan, I said, is open 24 hours — 24 hours basta corruption. And that is why that fiasco about the frigate ni Trillanes was because ‘yung Koreano na napagbili ng barko, who sold the ship to the Philippine government, wala pa hong delivery. And it was there already ready.\\nAnd that is why that Korean went to Malacañan just to complain why is it that there is no request for delivery. So I told Bong, “Bong, ayusin mo ‘yan.” He went to Lorenzana and Lorenzana nagsulat siya. May nakakuha because sa Malacañan, every administration may tao ‘yan diyan. Every administration leaves some of the men because they are appointed on plantilla position.\\nEh kinuha nila then it was brought here, before the Congress. And so Bong was called to testify. And he said, he was assured it will be a closed-door. I told Bong, “No, ask for an open and public hearing.”\\nSabi ko, “Sabihin mo sa lahat — wala — you have nothing. Just say the truth.” Sabi ko, pagkatapos niya testify, sabi ko, “Bong, maniwala ka hindi, you will be a senator.” [] Totoo ‘yan. That is the story of how convoluted politics and corruption here in our country works.\\nEquipped with political will, the government ordered the closure of Boracay Island for six months to prevent its further deterioration. We cleaned and rehabilitated the island and I allowed it to heal naturally. I am proud to say that it has been restored close to its original pristine state. Boracay Inter- Agency Task Force led by Secretary Cimatu, and fully supported by Secretaries Año, Romulo-Puyat — Oh what’s her name? Puro surname ito,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRomulo-Puyat. What’s her name? Ah si — ah Berna. Ah, Berna Romulo-Puyat, Bello and Villar, and then TESDA Chief Mamondiong for this huge success. Kudos are also due to the PMS for integrating the six-month Rehabilitation Plan, and the NEDA for the recently-approved [Medium]-term Boracay Action Plan. []\\nBoracay Island is just the beginning. And the girls there, the foreigners are waiting for you gentlemen to visit the place. They are all on the beach sunbathing. You are invited to — I have not been there.\\nAlam mo, nung naayos ‘yan, day before we were told that there’s gonna be an opening tomorrow. So on the TV on that day, Magandang Hapon, showed a lot of buntings and banners, “Salamat Duterte.” So when I saw it, I called the military and the police, “Remove the buntings. I am not going there.” No need to really arbi — ah advertise. I am paid for what I’m doing. Nakokornihan ako. Too much adulation, bordering pretentions. I can always smell it a mile away.\\nAnd I never went there until now. What I did was I went to the other side of the island and asked the DAR, “What is the status of the land behind the beach of Boracay?” And they are still categorized as forestal and agriculture. “Not…” I said, “Not commercial?” “No, sir.”\\nSo I told the Agrarian Reform, “Go to the place, have it inspected because I will declare the whole of the island a land reform program.” And I gave the islands piece by piece to the Atis, the natives of the place para walang masabi. Marami kasi ginawa ko raw [] para linisan ko, ibigay ko sa mga kaibigan ko.\\nWala akong kaibigang mayaman. Ayaw kong kaibigan ng mayaman because pagka mayaman ka, tatabi ka lang sa akin, pati ako napahiran na ng kung ano-ano ang hingiin mo sa gobyerno.\\nThere are those who violate environmental rules. I am giving due notice to the LGUs and other stakeholders, kayo po, of tourist destinations to take extra steps in the enforcement of our laws and the protection of our environment.\\nOn January 27, 2019, we officially started the Manila Bay rehabilitation. Though we have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the test results of the waters near Padre Faura. We will relocate informal settlers — I hope it can happen during my time — along the waterways and shut down establishments that continue to pollute and poison our waters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake a choice. I’m going to the… [Malaki ba ‘yung building diyan?] I’m going to dismantle your burning — ah building — or just simply burn it down so that we can have a new set-up of environmental friendly, whatever that means.\\nThrough the Build, Build, Build Program in emerging economic hubs outside Metro Manila. This will swiftly gain ground, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Team led by Secretary Dominguez. Hard at work in the interconnection of our islands and cities by air, land, and sea are Secretaries Tugade and Villar.\\nAlam naman ninyo. Magaganda na ang airport ninyo. Inuna ko nga kayo eh. Everybody’s complaining about the Davao airport and I said, “Davao will be the last.” Kung hindi na maabutan, sabi ko mga taga-Davao, pasensya na kayo. Para walang masabi ang Congress sa atin, baka nga 3% sila doon sa kabila.\\nWe also paved the way for the entry of third telecommunications provider. Do not worry about this. There is no corruption at all. I guarantee you, upon the grave of my father. I do not allow — I do not talk to them. I just say: Just do your work. And kung maaari, according to what the specifications are required by this government.\\nI challenge this new player to fulfill its commitment to provide fast and reliable telecommunication services to our people, especially in the underserved areas. DICT Secretary Honasan will be the lead man in this endeavor. I hope he is here. []\\nHowever, developmental gains will not be felt by our people in the countryside if we cannot maintain law and order. ‘Yang peace and security, wala ‘yan. We need to enforce the law.\\nAfter almost two decades of peace negotiation, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was finally passed and ratified.\\nFor decades, our Muslim brothers in the ARMM have been mired in poverty. My late Muslim brother, MinDA Chair Abdul Khayr Alonto, envisioned a progressive, peaceful, and united Mindanao during our lifetime. It is my hope that the Bangsamoro Transition will fast-track the establishment of regional government that will secure and comfortable life for Muslim brothers and sisters, and all indigenous communities in the Bangsamoro Regions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, I have taken the helm of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict and have assigned a Cabinet member to each region to harmonize government efforts in attaining national development [and] security.\\nThrough the exceptional leadership of Secretary Briones and the DepEd, I am proud to say that this year more Filipino learners are receiving basic education, with over 27 million enrollees from Kinder to Senior High School. []\\nAnd because we have still a little to spare, the fastest population growth, one of the — is the Philippines. We are so industrious that we are producing more people than… [] I do not want to quarrel with the religious but…\\nMore than [823,000] — sorry my eyes is not good — for the… Isinusuot ko lang ‘to ‘pag mag — paminsan-minsan eh. Out-of-school youth and adult learners were able to access non-formal education through the Alternative Learning System. For our national sports development, I support the proposed measure to create the National Academy of Sports for High School students. []\\nAlmost 86,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises or the MSMEs have received over P3 billion worth of loans since 2017, thanks to the efforts of Secretary Lopez and the DTI.\\nAdditional benefits for solo parents, [] the assignment of health workers in all barangays, and the expansion of the Malasakit Centers, are what we also hope to achieve through the bills filed by the original concept of Bong Go. [] Para manalo sa kampanya, ‘yon ang mantra niya. Totohanin mo lang, Bong, mapahiya tayong lahat. []\\nI also implore Congress… You — look. You have to study this very carefully. Congress has to postpone the May 2020 elections and ‘yung Barangay, Sangguniang Kabataan to October 2022. Because if you read it, this… [] To rectify the truncated terms. Paiba-iba na eh. The truncated terms of sitting barangays but also provide them with the ample time to finish their programs and projects. I suggest Congress should also enact the Magna Carta for Barangays. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Administration’s malasakit at serbisyo program has, of course, reached the Filipinos who labor in foreign lands. The milestone signing of the Bilateral Labor Agreement with Kuwait in 2018 is a testament of my commitment to stop abuses inflicted on our overseas Filipinos. To ensure their welfare, protection and their access to government services, the establishment of the Department of Overseas Filipinos will sufficiently address this particular need. []\\nOur accomplishments for the past three years and the plans for the next three are discussed in detail in my mid-term report to the people, copies of which shall be made available before the day ends.\\nLet me repeat what I said many times before. Honestly, I have identified the enemy who dumped us into this quagmire we are in. I have met the enemy face-to-face and sadly, the enemy is “us.” We are our own tormentors — addressing the Filipino people — we are our own demons; we are as rapacious predators preying on the helpless, the weak and the voiceless. We find corruption everywhere in government with every malefactor watching his cohort’s back in blatant disregard of his oath when he assumed public office. Even the language has evolved to soften the wickedness of the criminal act. “For the Boys”, “sponsoring an event” or what-else-have-you. No amount of euphemism can trivialize or normalize betrayal of public trust or any other criminal offense. It is an injury laced with insult. It is both a national embarrassment and a national shame.\\nFor every transaction, a commission; for every action, extortion; and a request that goes on and on – endlessly and shamelessly.\\nCatharsis is what we, individually and collectively, need to do today – not tomorrow but today. Self-purgation followed by the resolve to do what is right and proper, is good for the nation’s health.\\nLet me ask you: When will corruption end? Kailan ba talaga ‘to? Hanggang kailan? Well, I don’t know. I’ve been in — with government for almost 35 years now. I am not singling out myself. It’s the entire gamut of our system.\\nCorruption exasperates. It frustrates. It is also exasperating that there are times when I think that perhaps it is blood that we need to cleanse and rinse away the dirt and the muck that stick to the flesh like leeches.\\nOf course, it is only a thought. I am simply thinking aloud. To dispel any controversy that my statements in this regard will create something else. Words of Pedro Guerrero who said, “Sometimes they write what I say and they write — and they write what I say and not what I mean.” So ‘yung mga pa-purga-purga lang diyan. I use similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and other figures of speech every now and then, to prove or stress a point. I am as human as anybody else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the matter of the Philippine — West Philippine Sea. The avoidance of conflict — armed conflict and protection of our territorial waters and natural resources compel us to perform a delicate balancing act. A shooting war is grief and misery multiplier. War leaves widows and orphans in its wake. I am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction, more widows and more orphans, should war, even on a limited scale, breaks out. More and better results can be reached in the privacy of a conference room than in a squabble in public. That is why I will do in the peaceful way, mindful of the fact that it is our national pride and territorial integrity that are at stake.\\nShort of expressly advocating a call to arms, there are those who say that we should stand up and stop those who fish in our economic zone. Of course we will do in due time. There is…\\nAlam mo ganito ‘yan eh. Noong — when I became President and when the M16 rifles were cancelled by America upon the prodding of the US Congress, I found myself in a quandary because reports were already very ripe na there was the passing of arms in Marawi.\\nAnd because of the arms were already — mostly in the hands of the police, hands-me-down from the army were quite old and sometimes the bolt that pushes the bullet flies out and the barrel has really become lose, and there are no more launch and planes to push it into a circular trajectory to maintain its accuracy.\\nSo I was forced to go to China. Eh mabuti’t na lang nasabi ko sa inyo ‘to. Then in China, we had a bilateral. I brought along the military man — Año, the chief of staff then, and all of them, Lorenzana, Esperon, National Security.\\nIn that meeting, I said — Cabinet members were there — “I want to go to my territory to dig oil.” That was the word, “I dig.” Because that is ours. Ang sabi ni President Xi, “Well, you know there is a conflict there. Do you think, rather than go there and have a confrontation — not necessarily the grey ships, war ships. But you know a squabble there could lead to something else.” Sabi niya, we just became friends. And perhaps we can talk about this. But not an outright precipitate move because… He said it softly, “It can mean trouble.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the trouble comes out from the mouth of a president of a republic, anong magawa ko? So what did I answer? “Well then maybe, sir, we can talk about this at some other time.” But definitely, before I go, we must talk about the West Philippine Sea. We cannot you know, have our cake and eat it too.\\nYou know, I cannot go there even to bring the Coast Guard to drive them away. China also claims the property and he is in possession. ‘Yan ang problema. Sila ‘yung in possession and claiming all the resources there as an owner. We are claiming the same but we are not in the position because of that fiasco noong dalawang nag-standoff doon during the time of my predecessor si Albert, ambassador. If I’m correct. I do not know his real name. Tayo ang umatras. Pagsabi niya umatras, that was a kind of a compromise. Tayo ang umatras. Noong umatras tayo, pumasok sila. Marami na.\\nThat day, we lost the Spratly and the Panganiban Island. Iyan ang totoo. Walang bolahan ‘yan. Ngayon, may arbitral ruling. I… I said, I could not even ask for the oil claiming the entire resources of the…\\nAnong sabihin ko sa kanila? Kaya sinabi ko, “Let us do this mutually.” Of course, when Xi says, “I will fish,” who can prevent him? And sabi ko naman, “We will fish because we claim it.”\\nAnd sabi ko, “Please allow because…” Before that, they were driving away our fishermen. ‘Di ba inaabog nila? Kaya sabi ko, “Do not drive them away because the Filipinos are of the belief that they are also — they claim it.”\\nNow, if you deprive — deprive the Filipinos of — there, magkagulo talaga ‘yan. And it could lead to ano — not really war, and I said, “we have to…”\\nKaya ang sabi ko… When I said, “I allowed,” that was on the premise that I own the property. Pero hindi tayo in control of the property. Ayan magsabi sila, “Of course, I will allow you.” Kaya pinabalik.\\nEh ‘yung disgrasya, ‘yung pagsabi “a mere incident — legal, marine incident,” ‘yan ang ginagamit sa batas ‘yan, “a marine incident happened.” Hindi naman sinasabi na “marine accident.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was just nabanggan, wala naman. So they wanted to talk, tapos ayaw dito. And so, “So sige, we will investigate and you investigate, and when you are ready, we should meet and compare notes, and let us determine who pays for what damage.”\\nGanun lang. Ipadala ko ‘yung marines ko to drive away the Chinese fishermen. I guarantee you, not one of them will come home alive.\\nKung ipadala ko ‘yung limang — pati ‘yung frigate ko na bago, ‘yung pinagkaguluhan nila ni Trillanes diyan sa — that made Bong a Senator, ubos ‘yan because there are already guided missiles in that island.\\nAnd the fastest that they have installed there can reach Manila in seven minutes. You want war? Alam mo, asaran ‘yan eh. Supladuhan ‘yan. Kung supladuhan lang, murahin, “P***** i** mo, l**** ka. Umalis ka diyan.”\\nKung ganunan lang, bright ako diyan. Hanggang bunganga lang. Pero kung bunutan na ng baril, ah pwede siguro basta dalawa lang. But the problem is, there — whether we do it in a diplomatic way, there will be heated arguments, sigurado ‘yan.\\nWe do it in a confrontation doon. We try to drive them away, it could lead to a violence. Any way ‘yan. By the way the President answered when I said “I will dig my oil” the first time I went to China.\\nNakita ko ‘yung tao eh. So you can, more or less, draw a profile of his, “Please do not do that because there will be trouble.” Ano… Anong magagawa ko?\\nI go there, I said, “The fisheries who were…” And besides, I was invoking ‘yung traditional fishing rights. It is in that arbitral ruling. Ayaw lang ninyong gustong tignan.\\nIt is mentioned there that even before countries were in existence, people around an ocean or a lake had already been fishing there for generations. And that is why fishing rights are allowed in the so many cases between Finland and Germany, decided by UNCLOS — UNCLOS and the International Law of the Seas.\\nUNCLOS is a product of a treaty. That treaty is also a part of our land because we are a signatory. Eh kung basahin lang ninyo ‘yan nang husto, it is there. You might just…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina and everybody recognizes traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments. That law is a humane law.\\nSo I’m sorry I have to… I promised you 40 minutes. My God, I… You want me to stop? We can go home now. [] I have exceeded my… There is the, you know, there is a time for everything.\\nDo not believe the others because they are not my friends. They are my political enemies. They said I do not believe in God. Who says? I am a believer of a universal mind there.\\nBut [] I do not believe that a God so perfect would create hell for his creation. What kind of God is he? He is not my God. There is a time to — for everything. A time to negotiate and a time to quarrel with your enemy, with your political opponents or with your wife.\\nThat is why some lives here are… And a time to antagonize and a time to make peace and a time to go to war, and a time to live and a time to die. That’s Ecclesiastes 3.\\nOur ownership of the Philippine — West Philippine Sea is internationally recognized. However, both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arbitral Award in the case of People — “Republic of the Philippines vs. People’s Republic of China” recognize instances where another state may utilize the resources found within the coastal state’s Exclusive Economic Zone.\\nThe arbitral ruling even states, the one that they are charging me for violating the Constitution…. Sino gani ‘yon? Suntukin lang kita diyan ngayon mabuti pa. Nandito eh. The arbitral ruling even states that the Philippines may enter into fishing agreements with other states, provided certain conditions and requisites in the UNCLOS are met.\\nSo ‘yung akin, sabi niya, “Let’s go fish.” Sabi ko, “You have to act…” You know, they have been there fishing since time immemorial. I think it was Adam who got the first Lapu-Lapu there.\\nLet me assure you, that national honor and territorial integrity shall not — shall be foremost in our mind, and when we may take the next steps in this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmoldering controversy over the lines of arbitral ruling, the West Philippine Sea is ours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no ifs and buts. It is ours. But we have been acting, [] along that legal truth and line. But we have to temper it with the times and the realities that we face today.\\nPoverty incidence fell from 27.6 percent in the first half of 2015 to 21 percent in the first half of 2018. The most important number, though, is the six million Filipinos we need to pull out from poverty. Kindly help me on this.[]\\nAnd you know, as I said, corruption is everywhere. You are free to investigate. I don’t take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime.\\nYou do not have to call me. Call the idiots, expose them, and send them to jail. You are helping me. Do not be… I am not… I’ve been a prosecutor. I know how it works. Feel free. Feel free to expose anything that is not in accordance with law.\\nWe have pursued tax reforms to fund our poverty reduction programs. I therefore implore Congress to immediately pass Package 2 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, or the TRABAHO Bill, which shall gradually lower the income — corporate income tax, and rationalize and improve fiscal incentives.\\nIt will energize our MSMEs and encourage them to expand their business and hopefully generate, hopefully — I’m missing the word hopefully para sabihin na “you’re all talk” — hopefully [1.4] million jobs in the coming years. The MSMC — MSMEs hold the promise of raising a lot of the Filipinos.\\nI therefore believe that it is now time for Congress to approve a new version of the Salary Standardization Law. Ngayon na. [] And to the teachers, alam mo dito who toil and work tirelessly to educate our young.\\nKasali na po dito ‘yung hinihingi ninyo. Hindi naman masyadong malaki, pero it will tide you over during these hard times. A little bit bigger than before. [] This is intended to increase the salaries of national government workers, including teachers and nurses. Nurses, correct. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am also asking Congress to pass the remaining packages of my Administration’s Tax Reform Program, and the bills that would further raise excise taxes on — very good, let us do it — tobacco and alcohol.\\nSinong naninigarilyo dito? They should be exterminated from the face of the earth. [] They are the ones… You know, I… I’m… I do not hide my-\\n— what’s wrong with me. I acquired Buerger’s disease because I smoke.\\nBut I made it a national policy because you know when I was new mayor, I went around to see the discos and night clubs. I could hardly see the faces of the people inside. You have to wade into a thick smoke to just recognizeone.\\nSo that’s when I decided. But I was still smoking. But I decided because I knew, I already had it. So it’s time to — sabi ko. And a national law, para lahat na, that at 12 o’ clock, everything closes.\\nI am not trying to pull a chair here. Mine was that two o’clock noon sa Davao, it was two then I reduced it to one. When that boxing mayor there became mayor, she reduced it to six. Walang order, no orders in advance.\\nKasi we have ordered already, so you can close but we have to drink. Itong ngayon, at 12, everything closes down. Nobody works. So I… I think that we should adopt it. Most of the states, in many states, in many countries, ganun man. Alas dose, sarado na talaga.\\nWe have to stop drinking. And jukebox, they’re only good up to eight, nine. Eight, maganda ‘yan. It’s a… It’s there in every corner, store. Blares out noise and the children who will go to school and the working class, and you are there with your store.\\nI have prohibited it in Davao. And at 12, as you see, Davao is quiet because everybody is resting already. Be it in the memorial parks, cemetery, or inthe comfort of their homes.\\nThe valuation system has also to be improved local government units and rationalize capital income [taxation]. I urge Congress to review and pass the Government Rightsizing Bill to reconfigure the existing Metro Manila-centric bureaucracy; streamline government systems in order to deliver services without delay and within a short timeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese reforms would be for naught if we cannot avert of a “new poor” every time a disaster strikes. The Philippine experience has shown that natural disasters and — are poverty creators.\\nThat is why, we need to hasten the establishment of a Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) so that these department focus on the natural hazards and climate change. I urge Congress to fast-track the passage of the Administration of this bill — Administration version rather. In 2017, I reminded all of you of the probable consequence of a catastrophic earthquake in Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces. Since then, I have established the Project Management Office for the Earthquake Resilience and the Greater Manila Area to implement two-pronged strategy on earthquake resilience and mitigation efforts.\\nI just heard, it’s not in my speech. I just heard that from a psychic that the first crack when the “Big One” hits, will be right here in the center of\\nthis… [ and ]\\n‘Yan man ang sabi nila. “Philippines is so corrupt, it’s so lousy that if you kill all congressmen, senators and the president, we will have a new\\nday.” [] So I pray that if the earthquake comes, it comes now. This moment. [] Kumpleto na tayo. May madamay pa tayo doon sa harap. []\\nWe weathered one damaging effect of climate change this year. The El Niño were wreaked havoc in the agricultural sector and caused water shortage in the greater Metro Manila area. We need to pass bill creating the Department of Water Resources and Water Regulatory Commission. []\\nAlam mo, the agencies and the guys there handling the — the entire water works system — you have to change it immediately.\\nYou know what, there was this three-day no water. I was in Davao. So everybody was complaining and I was even afraid to come here because what if my girlfriend will not be able to – — to take a bath. [] She will smell like hell. So I said, I’ll wait for the water to wash her.\\nAlam mo kung hindi ako nagmura, kung hindi ko sinabi, “p**** i**, papatayin ko kayo, p**** i** niyo.” And then when I arrived in the morning, there was water. And my girlfriend was fresh. []\\nI also call on Congress to pass a law mandating a Fire Protection Modernization Program. Diyan tayo nagka-ano. If you go to Davao, you’ll\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfind the best. The best of everything, 911, all the cameras, all the screens. We did that if you can find it.\\nAlam mo — alam mo sabi ni… Is there… Sonny is here? Secretary Dominguez? Ah Sonny. Siya man ang magyayabang. Sabi niya, “marami tayong pera”. Pero ‘pag tanungin namin siya doon sa Cabinet meeting, “tsk tsk tsk tsk, walang pera, walang pera”. [] Si Diokno ganun rin kaya gi-tapon ko sa Central Bank. []\\nEvery time sabihin mo, you know we discussed projects, we plan and we submit it to Congress, it’s final imprimatur. Eh ‘di kami ang, “May pera ba tayo diyan, sir? “Wala.” “Magkano?” “Four billion.” “Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk that is not the tsk tsk practice. No money, no money.” P***. Saan pala ang pera natin dito? Sa bulsa ninyo? [] Karaming collection natin dito. But Sonny says that we can fund. This one we have to answer.\\nNow, I would like to remind… Pagbigyan na lang ninyo ako tutal para naman ito sa lahat. Alas- sais pa nga ginugutom na kayo. Hindi pala kayo nag- merienda?\\nAlam mo, ever since na-integrate ‘yan you would notice in your cities and provinces the deterioration of the service itself. Wala ng mga truck, luma na. And would you believe it in Davao City, I’ll show it to you, we have a\\n1934 Studebaker fire truck. Maganda pa.\\nSo we have to — we have to do better than this. There are other cities which are utterly — – utterly without the tools to respond the challenges of fire. We have to come up with something that is really good.\\nI mean at this age, it would be a shame if you cannot put up a fire in two days, three days, my God. We have to set aside.\\nSonny, you have the money? [] Oh yes. Oh see. Basta sa maraming tao mahiya man mag-deny. [] Totoo ‘yan. Totoo ‘yan. We have the money so maybe Sonny can give you a figure that we can set aside.\\nNakakahiya talaga itong ano natin. Ang Davao, meron. Davao has a very good 911. Hindi ako nagyayabang. And we have cameras in every corners that’s why we can solve crimes immediately. And meron kaming 911. “What is your emergency?” That’s the standard. So it’s fire, they call the fire department.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSabi ko, “911.” “Yes.” “What’s your emergency?” “I — I seemed to lost my –\\n— to have lost my girlfriend.” “We know you, Mayor. You go back to Manila there are plenty left there. Go.” []\\nThis will equip the fire — Bureau of Fire Protection with tools to respond to the challenges. I further ask Congress to urgently pass the Na — ito — the National Land Use Act or NALUA within this year. [] Paki lang po. So that we can proceed with the new… Well, we can meet the — the demands of the new investors coming in. Ang lupa natin ang problema eh.\\nA science-based national land use plan would serve as basis for the LGUs in crafting respective development plans, and help disperse economic activities to the countryside.\\nThe dispersion of economic and business activities to Visayas and Mindanao is not just a campaign promise. It is an economic imperative and a key to our country’s sustainable and equitable development. We will encourage investments that would develop the rural areas and Metro Manila and other mega urban areas.\\nLet me cut here, tutal maliit na lang. I would just like to remind everybody. No offense intended to the mayors and governors to the local government. Pero ‘yang style ninyo na it takes about three days, four days for the employees of a certain company, store, or whatever to go back and forth, back and forth.\\nWhen they go back, you have a new regulation. He gets it, he secures it and when he goes back, oh there’s still you have to follow — you have to get this paper.\\nI will tell you now. Hindi ako nagyayabang. In Davao, it’s one hour unless there is a need for ocular inspection. I am directing you publicly mayors — mayors. I am directing also the DILG, Secretary Año of the local government to see to it that this is honored. All clearances, permits emanating from your office that would need also your approval, must be out at the very least within three days. []\\nYou do not do that. I am directing si Secretary Año, is he here, sir? Nandito ka? Oh Secretary Año, he is the former chief of staff, he’s also a military man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI want three days, unless there is an exceptional reason, three days, para hindi na magpa- balik-balik kasi diyan ang perahan eh. Pagdating doon meron na naman hingin, pagdating doon may hingin.\\nKaya I said the Filipinos if it is done to you, I’m telling you, slap the guy, create a scene, create a scandal because that incident however little will reach me. And if it does, you can be sure, if I do not call you and the idiot, I will go there myself. That is a promise, that is a pledge. []\\nMake it a part of my oath of office. Lahat kayo diyan pati ‘yang tsk — easement. Well, under Villar, okay na. Pero ‘yang easement billion dollar — ah billion pesos. Well, if it’s a foreign company, it’s a billion dollar thing.\\nGanun ‘yan. Pabalik-balik at hindi binabayaran. That’s why nagpatong… If all moneys and revenues due government are collected in good faith, marami tayong pera. I’m telling you as President. Marami tayong pera para extra money to uplift the — the mass of Filipinos who are suffering. Maski ospital lang and housing.\\nJobs, it’s the economy that runs it. If the economy is good, more jobs. At the meantime, itong hospitalization, education, the basic things at saka itong relocation. Kaawa talaga.\\nKung makolekta lang lahat hindi ma-corrupt ang pera, marami tayong pera. Kaya ako nagsabi. That’s why I — I resi…\\nYou know, I will make it public. I was at the Nayong Pilipino. I gave it to a group of people. Tapos nagpa-bidding sila. Ang nagbidding nila is to allow a gambling casino to be erected there inside the Nayong Pilipino.\\nKaya ko nagsabi t*** i** ninyo. Anong kahulugan ng Nayong Pilino kung lagyan mo ng sugalan and without a bidding? You know, nandiyan na ‘yung mga generals, they are there, chief of staff. Kasi pag galing doon pumunta ako sa command conference. Pagdating ko sa command conference, may ipinasa si Sonny ghost delivery sa AFP hospital. Eh galing pa ako doon sa…\\nWhen I was facing the military and police, sabi ko, “Look, I thought I had my back covered by you? If I cannot trust you, you better tell me now. Because if you the commanders of the Air Force, Army pati Albayalde and the Navy, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwill step down now. I am resigning, I’ll go back to Davao. You do the explaining to the people why.”\\nGinanun ko talaga. And in one of the Cabinet meetings ganun rin. There was this two-year, pabalik-balik na ‘yung — back and forth, back and forth, for two years it was sitting on their ass, the papers.\\nSo when they were explaining to me the revised plan and with so many requirements, clearances from NBI, I stood up with the Cabinet members, lahat kami. In a Cabinet meeting I said, “Stop. That idiotic matrix is not for me. That is intended for the next — maybe the president after the next.” Lumabas ako sabi ko, “Inyo na ‘yang gobyerno ninyo.”\\nSabi ko wala ako… I — I’m tired. I’m tired and I am… Talagang gusto ko na rin mag-resign. Sabi ko I am not happy anymore. Sabi ko anytime — ah the military said, if you want to go out? If you want to take over coup d’etat, go ahead. Do not bring your armors. Do not bring your weapons here. Just call me and we’ll have coffee.\\nI do not believe. I think Marcos and Estrada were correct that they did not allow the… Kasi ‘yung guwardiya mo, guwardiya dito, pareho ‘yan. Lahat sila dadaan ‘yan sa presidential command. All of them will be assigned. Nag- iikot ‘yan sila lahat. A taste of everything. Hanggang Mindanao kaya kilala ko ‘yan sila lahat dumaan ng Mindanao eh.\\nSabi ko talaga, “Inyo na. Ayaw ko na.” Sabi ko, “Sige, sinong gusto? Raise your right hands. I…” “I…” “Duly appointed member of the junta, will now make the SONA next month.”\\nAh bahala kayo diyan. You threatened about… If you think that you can run the country better than the elected one, go ahead. That’s not my — it’s the problem of the Filipino people.\\nTalaga sa Cabinet na — na tsk… Kaya abutan ako ng topak, magbaba dito ako ngayon. Bahala na kayo diyan. I’m going home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne ese — one estimate pegs economic losses at P3.5 billion a day due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila. So meantime, I reiterate my directive, my request, my pleadings to the MMDA and all concerned local officials in Metro Manila, and all other cities, to undertake immediate action to ensure the speedy and smooth flow of vehicular traffic. Reclaim all public roads that are being used for private ends. Marami diyan. []\\nAnd again, I asked Secretary Año to see to it that this is enforced. If there is a mayor or a governor, or kung ano kang — sino kang demonyo ka, i- suspend mo Sir Año. Give him time and if he cannot — if he is not up to it, then pagpahingain mo na lang. Suspend mo na. Wala talagang — wala tayong magawa.\\nThey just keep on pleasing their own constituents just because they are constituents — a leader. Ganun kayo eh. The only way to do it… Anyway, me, I have no problem. Me, I am an inutil official. Me, I cannot run anymore. Me, after six years I might lose my head. Wala na ako. I… No more challenges in politics. No more mountains to climb. I will just do my duty.\\nAnd most of my Cabinet members are actually military men. You know why? Gusto ninyong malaman? Do not be embarrassed. Atin-atin na lang ito.\\nHuwag mo na silang pansinin, ‘yang mga ano diyan. Parang nag meeting- meeting lang tayo dito. [] ‘Yung parang nagpulung-pulong lang. Do not mind them. Eh kung tignan kasi ninyo mahiya kayo.\\nKasi ganito ‘yan, my penchant for military men. I want to ingratiate myself to them? What? I was elected by the people, not by the military, not by the police. But to — why do I have this I said — this predisposed of… Kasi utusan sila madali. Kasi ‘pag sinabi mong walang corruption, walang corruption. Kaya lang ang military and just like any organization, ‘pag ang top diyan general o ang commander-in-chief corrupt, ku-corrupt ‘yan lahat.\\nPero kung sabihin mo na matino ka, they will follow. So Boracay I\\nsent Cimatu. Sabi ko, “Puntahan mo nga doon.” Is General Cimatu here, si Roy? Ah yeah.\\nItong si Roy nakilala ko ito sa Mindanao. Hindi ko man ‘yan kilala. Mindanao… Na-mayor kasi ako 23 years. So all of them passed by Mindanao, kilala ko. ‘Pag inutusan mo, kaagad. And they know that I will not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngive illegal orders for them to implement. Alam nila abugado ako. Sabi ko sundin lang ako ninyo.\\nKaya I was surprised when I ordered Cimatu to go there — to Boracay, Sir Frank. Alam mo ang ginawa niya? The next day lumabas siya roon sa Daily Mirror. Naglalakad siya doon sa beach, naka-t-shirt ng blue at ‘yung mata niya nandoon sa dalawang Caucasian na nag… []\\n“G****** it, Cimatu. Akala ko ba inutusan kita?” “Yes, sir.” “O bakit ka nagpalakad-lakad diyan sa beach tinitignan mo ‘yung naka-bikini na dalawang puti?” “Sir, napadaan lang ako sir.” Sabi ko, “Trabahuin mo ‘yan ha.” And they did it in six months’ time. Of course with a… [] I like Cimatu because he mixed his pleasure with\\nwork. [] That is the way how to do it. []\\nI give you until the last week of the year ‘yung sa — September na to do this. Clean the\\nLGUs. Walang mangyari dito.\\nWe shall continue to invest in the countryside through agricultural programs that will increase the productivity and income of our small farmers and fisherfolk. We shall ensure the full implementation of the Rice Tariffication Law, including the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund. This will safeguard the livelihood of small farmers through the provisions of modern farm equipment and machineries, seeds and credit, and extension services.\\nI also have not forgotten my commitment to uplift the lives — ito — coconut farmers and further develop the coconut industry until the urgent —\\n– ah through the urgent utilization of the Coconut Levy Fund. That is 100 million. [] Kaya ako very careful until now wala akong nakuha. Look, it is really hard to look for an\\nhonest man. I must admit it. Baka ako hindi ko rin kaya. I do not have that well…\\nItong coco fund na ito, ito ‘yung naiwan sa — noong kay Marcos na levy fund. This is sacred money. This money was taken out of the pockets of the Filipinos arbitrarily. Wala kang magawa noon eh martial law. Ito na ‘yan.\\nKaya itong coco levy fund, kung sabihin mo lang, tama ang Supreme Court. Hindi mo pwedeng maibigay — sabi mo sino. You can no longer trace the truthful owner of the land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAng plano ko, kung gusto ninyo, you save the money. You invest the money. Siguro mag-abot ‘yan ng mga more than 100 billion. Ilagay na lang ninyo ng ano trust fund for the government. It’s about mga 5 billion. Ayon na lang ang gastusin ninyo to reserve the money. Rather than do it parang sprinkle na ibigay mo sa mga tao. You cannot — sabi ng Supreme Court tama sila —\\n– you can no longer trace the genealogy of the owners — the original owners. And\\nsometimes it would fail.\\nI will not act on that until I find the money. Wala pa akong nakuha. I have yet — I have yet to look for the money. Hanggang ngayon naghahanap ako. Wala akong makita. Kasi malaki ito and this will — this will, you know, if you assign a corrupt idiot there. Kaya gusto — ang gusto ko o baka nagustuhan rin ninyo, i-deposito ko na lang. Let it remain as a remembrance to the people who lost their ah — at that time. Tapos ‘yung 5 billion, ‘yon ‘yung to improve the econo — the improvement sa replanting sa coconut.\\nFive billion, that’s a big money. Pero kung ibigay mo, let it sprinkler, walang mangyayari. ‘Yung taga-bigay kukuha ‘yan — ‘yung pupunta. That’s why itong Land Bank na ito, ‘pag hindi ito na… You know, you are called Land Bank but you are now the number one commercial bank in the Philippines.\\nWhat the heck is happening to you? You are supposed to finance agricultural enterprises and endeavors. Bakit wala? [] Bakit — why can’t you just buy a few wagons or whatever? Go to the countryside and ask the people if there are cooperatives, tulungan ninyo to form one. []\\n‘Pag wala, eh tignan ninyo na maibigay ninyo for replanting of the coconut —\\n– to revive the coconut industry. Pahiramin ninyo ng pera plus the money — ‘nung sabi ko of the coconut levy. That is sacred money. Land Bank should go back to land. Why are you mired in so many commercial transactions?\\nBumalik kayo where you were created for and that is to help the farmers. Ilang administration na wala? [] You better decide on that, I will give you until the end of July to give me a plan or else I will ask Congress to reconfigure you what-not. Wala eh, wala kayong… []\\nI’m asking now Congress, ‘pag wala sila — if there is no viable plan for that for the farmers and it is just all commercial transactions, might as well abolish it and give the money to the congressmen for their development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfunds. [] O mas makatulong pa. Diretso eh. Ayaw\\nninyo? [] O ayaw daw nila, Sir Frank. Huwag mo na lang galawin.\\nI once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a more responsive version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund to ensure the accelerated utilization of coco levy funds for the well-being and empowerment of the coconut farmers. []\\nWe recognize the urgent need to ensure the sustainability and availability of resources and the development of alternative ones. In this regard, I trust that Secretary Cusi shall fast-track also the development of renewable energy sources, and reduce dependence on the traditional energy sources such as coal.\\nFinally, sustaining our gains entails a national security posture capable of defending the country from external and internal security threats. Defense Secretary Lorenzana, together with the gallant men and women of the armed forces, is at the forefront of this fight.\\nWe expect support for legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening defense- related systems such as the proposed National Defense Act, the Unified Military and Uniformed Personnel Separation, Retirement, and Pension Bill, and the revival of the mandatory ROTC in Grades 11 and 12. []\\nVery important. Alam mo ‘pag mag giyera-giyera, 10 out of 10 hindi marunong maghawak ng baril to defend even his father and mother and brothers and sisters. Itong mga bata ngayon, they are bereft of the patriotism and the love of country. Balik sila dito.\\nI think a military training would be good for everybody. Kung hindi sige lang\\n— sa shabu, mamaya namatay, krrrkkk. “Duterte: Extrajudicial killing. Report to the ICC.” Ah okay. If you can provide me with a good comfortable cell, heated during winter time, I want to go — and an air-conditioned during hot weather. And a conjugal visits, unlimited, [] para we can understand each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are aware of the fact that there are times in AFP and PNP personnel, while in the performance of their duties, get unjustly sued. Providing them with free legal assistance to help and boost their morale.\\nMy fellow citizens, to borrow the words of Churchill — akin ‘to, this is mine: We are now entering a period of consequences. The consequences of what we did and did not do but should have done during my first half of my term. I assume full responsibility for that. As President, I cannot pass it — the blame to anybody. So it’s on me.\\nThough we cannot change the past, we will not squander the future. I will push harder in the pursuit of programs that we have started, but always within the parameters of the law. I will not merely coast along or while away my time during the remaining years of my administration. It ain’t my style. [] But I will not stop until I reach the finish line. Then and only then shall I call it a day. []\\nOur goal for the next three years is clear: a comfortable life for everybody, all Filipinos. We have made significant strides and accomplished signal milestones as a nation in the past three years. This momentum must continue with greater fervor in the next three years and beyond.\\nI dream of glowing days ahead for every Filipino. I dream of a Philippines better than the one I grew up with.\\nThis is my pledge and commitment for just three years, if I can. If I cannot, I’m sorry. But I shall continue to comply with my constitutional duty to serve and protect the Filipino, until the last day of my term.\\nGod Bless the Filipino. God Bless the Philippines. Thank you very much!

Our dream of prosperity for our country was suddenly snuffed by a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease.\\nBut let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives will itself be laid to rest.\\nIn the meantime, let us express the nation‘s gratitude to those who courageously and willingly put their lives on the line to serve the people and country. We share the griefs of their families and no amount of tears can compensate their great losses.\\nMy countrymen, it is sad that while government focuses its attention and resources to battle the coronavirus, there are those who take advantage of a pre-occupied government.\\nOne of them is Senator Frank Drilon. In an interview, he arrogantly mentioned among others that oligarchs need not be rich. Then he linked the anti-dynasty system with oligarchy and the topic was my daughter and son. This happened after the Committee on Franchise voted 70-11 to deny the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngrant of franchise to ABS-CBN. Obviously, he was defending the Lopezes that they are not oligarchs.\\nGreat wealth enables economic elites and corporations to influence public policy to their advantage. Media is a powerful tool in the hands of oligarchs like the Lopezes who used their media outlets in their battles with political figures. I am a casualty of the Lopezes during the 2016 election.\\nThe dealers and purveyors of illegal drugs, hiding in the shadow of COVID- 19, have stepped up their activities. The amount of shabu valued at millions of pesos seized during police operations speak volumes of the enormity and weight of the problem that we bear.\\nThe corrupt, the grafters and the influence peddlers also take advantage of the fear and confusion that the coronavirus generates. The financial and material assistance of the government to the unemployed, the sick and the destitute running into billions of pesos, are not spared from corruption and ineptitude. Even the donations from well-meaning private persons are skimmed before reaching their intended beneficiaries. It is like snatching food from the mouths of babes.\\nThe profiteers, over-pricers and corrupt felons must be laughing while they stash their dirty monies. But not for long. They cannot outrun the long arm of the law.\\nIn this regard, the words of former President Ramon Magsaysay ring fresh and relevant today as on the day they were said decades ago. He said:\\n―We need men of integrity and faith like Rizal and del Pilar, men of action like Bonifacio, men of inflexible patriotism like Mabini. We need their zeal, their self-reliance, their capacity for work, their devotion to service, their ability to lose themselves in the common cause of building a nation.‖\\nIf we allow greed, self-interest and ambition to rule us, then as stated by one prominent physician, we will ―be left with nothing better than the lesser evil instead of the greater good.‖\\nIn my inaugural address four years ago, I said that no leader can succeed at anything of national importance [or] significance unless he has the cooperation and support of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe efforts and resources which we poured out produced the momentum needed to bring our country closer to our goals. Suffice it to state, we made significant strides over time.\\nOver 4.3 million poor families benefitted from the Pantawid Pamilya; over 9.2 million beneficiaries received subsidies under the Unconditional Cash Transfer program; we also made available [free] tertiary education and universal health care. Public utility drivers were given assistance through the Pantawid Pasada Program. There are complaints that some drivers did not receive any assistance at all. I have directed the DSWD and DILG to look into this.\\nI welcome the passage of the law postponing the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections. The postponement saved much-needed government funds and ensured implementation of projects under the current barangay officials. In hindsight, it also saved us from holding the polls while we dealt and continue to deal with the pandemic.\\nThe Malasakit Centers Act has proven to be of great help to our less fortunate citizens needing medical services through a one-stop platform in government hospitals. We commend the initiative and work of Senator Bong Go in this regard as well as other significant pieces of legislation. As of today, there are 75 Malasakit Centers serving Filipinos all over the country. These centers will be of great help in ensuring that our people remain healthy and resilient during these challenging times.\\nThe Salary Standardization Law of 2019 increases the salary of civilian government workers. I hope that this law will inspire our government workers to perform better and encourage young, brilliant citizens to join public service.\\nI appreciate the law establishing the National Academy of Sports. We can now give our deserving student-athletes the training and support they need to excel in their chosen field of endeavors.\\nWith the commitment of key members of Congress and the Executive Department, the PHISGOC, Philippine Sports Commission, and the Philippine Olympic Committee were bound together with one vision to host the\\n30th Southeast Asian Games. Our athletes prevailed. More than that, we fostered pride, patriotism, genuine sportsmanship, and camaraderie in our South East Asian brothers and sisters. Indeed, we won as one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo our business community and the general public, we assure you that the landmark Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act has been gaining momentum. We are closer to eliminating overregulation in government services.\\nFrontline processes, including consular services, processing of building and business permits, and services for overseas Filipinos and seafarers were streamlined. Passports and drivers‘ license validity were lengthened to ease the burden of the public.\\nWe received a BBB plus credit rating despite a sea of credit rating downgrades and negative outlook revisions worldwide. [] The Japan Credit Rating Agency upgraded us from BBB plus to A minus last month.\\nMeanwhile, Moody‘s has affirmed and maintained the country‘s ratings at B2 — Baa2 rather. [Understand. Because of the light I have … My eyesight is not as good as new.] Our fiscal position is strong, our economic and fiscal management prudent and our banking system robust. We are in a better position to weather the crisis caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic.\\nWe have accomplished significant infrastructure projects under the Build Build Build Program. I will not dwell lengthily on the nitty-gritty of our infrastructure accomplishments now lest I bore you. Instead we will release a comprehensive written report on our collective milestones and the details of accomplishments to remind us that perseverance, patience and determination will help us move forward even in the most difficult of times.\\nWe issued last year Executive Order No. 100 establishing the Diversity and Inclusion Program as a national program of the Government. We want to end the discrimination of persons on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and other character traits.\\nMy administration always believed that freedom from illegal drugs, terrorism, corruption and criminality, is itself a [human right].\\nPart of our efforts to uphold human rights is protection of the rights of children and the right against discrimination. Early last year, I signed Executive Order No. 92 creating the National Council Against Child Labor. Government efforts to protect the rights of children will be amplified to prevent, reduce and eliminate any form of child labor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur achievements along these lines have been extolled by an overwhelming number of our fellow member-States in the UN Human Rights Council, during its recently held 44th session last June.\\nRest assured that we will not dodge our obligation to fight for human rights.\\nMy countrymen, there are lessons to be learned from the coronavirus pandemic. It jolted us to realize that gains made after spending so much planning, effort, cost and time could diminish considerably and quickly for reasons beyond one‘s anticipation; that it is much easier to destroy than to build; that in a crisis of national proportions that affects every aspect of human life, governments need to have the support and cooperation of the people if it is to succeed in battling the cause of that crisis, that there are people who ask for compassion but show none themselves; that life, after all, is fickle like the weather.\\nThe gains we achieved in the first three and a half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road towards a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered.\\nThe global scale and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus.\\nIn this regard I would like to express my gratitude to all those who made possible the steady supply of food, water, and basic utilities [to] our households [] and the provision of basic social services and financial assistance to our people. Our profound gratitude goes to everyone who helped keep our country‘s food supply chain running, the valiant soldiers, policemen and security guards who kept peace and order [] in our communities; the dedicated personnel who kept our essential establishments operational. You showed us kindness and selflessness. You gave us strength. You risked your own lives to serve the greater good in keeping with the Filipino spirit of Bayanihan. []\\nI also thank the men and women of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases and the National Task Force against COVID-19 for all the countless hours it spent to keep the pandemic in check and for all the efforts it made to ensure the safety of our people. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me also recognize the efforts of the local government units that stepped up and initiated their own response measures to contain the effects of COVID-19 and its impact to their constituents. Have been — impact to its constituents. [The shadow says it’s a period there.]\\nI know exactly the difficulties you are undergoing. I pray that the officials of each LGU in our country – from the barangay to the autonomous regions – would set aside partisan politics and selfish interests to do what is right and good for all. []\\nI likewise issued Executive Order No. 104, which imposed ceilings on the retail prices of at least 133 drugs and medicines, and directed a continuous review of the retail prices of others. This proved to be providential now that we are facing a pandemic.\\nTo everyone who helped us in this time of great need, maraming salamat po. []\\nLet me say that the strength of a nation rests in the hands of the people acting as one with government, in the pursuit of common goals and objectives.\\nWhen the pandemic struck, I decided to prioritize life over other considerations. According to experts, the interventions that the government had put in place prevented as much as 1.3 to 3.5 million infections. To me, even if the numbers were much lower, it would still be and would have been worth the sacrifice[s] we made. ―Buhay muna, bago ang lahat.” []\\nWe initially encountered difficulties ramping up our testing capacity. We now have 93 accredited testing laboratories nationwide and we are aiming to conduct 1.4 million tests by end of July and ensure a quick turnaround time of 48 to 72 hours.\\nUnder the Social Amelioration Program, we allotted [PhP205 billion] for poor and low-income households who were affected during this pandemic — who thrive on a ―no-work, no-pay‖ arrangement. Admittedly, our implementation of the Social Amelioration Program was not perfect. And some opportunists turned crisis into opportunity. We will catch up with you sooner than you think.\\nWe came up with the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program. We extended financial assistance to over 650,000 affected individuals in the formal sector, 110,000 OFWs abroad, and almost 83,000 repatriated OFWs. We also provided temporary wage employment [opportunities] to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndisplaced marginalized workers through the TUPAD Project. Our indigent senior citizens were also provided with a stipend for the [first] semester of the current year.\\nThis health emergency stretched the government‘s resources to its limits. In response, the Office of the President worked closely with Congress for the quick passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\\nMay I again reiterate my thanks to you, the men and women of Congress, for the effort you invested into passing that law. I hope that we can get some or the same treatment of clarity, purpose and the\\nfastness [] to support the passage of the Bayanihan [to Recover as One Act], which will supplement funds for recovery and response against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWe must facilitate the country‘s economic recovery. I call on Congress to fast-track the passage of proposed measures such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or CREATE Act. [] This immediately cuts the corporate income levy from the current 30 to 25 percent and give the government flexibility to grant a combination of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, among others. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer or FIST Act will set up mechanisms allowing banks and other financial institutions to dispose of and transfer non-performing assets and loans to asset management companies similar to Special Purpose Vehicles.\\nOur economic managers have seen infrastructure investment as an effective tool to help spur high growth, attract investments, create jobs, and achieve financial inclusion for all Filipinos. The [DPWH] has resumed the construction of the North Luzon Expressway Harbor Link, the NLEX-SLEX Connector, the Cavite-Laguna Expressway, the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, the R-1 Bridge Project, the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway Project, and the Subic Freeport Expressway Project, to name a few. To realize the maximum benefit from the country‘s investments, the infrastructure projects under the Build, Build, Build Program, which are labor and capital intensive, are not mere springboards for the country‘s swift recovery [post]-pandemic. They are economic benefits — economic benefits to be distributed to all corners of the country and push sustainability in urban centers, particularly [Metro] Manila.\\nThe TESDA launched an online mode of livelihood and skills training. There are 71 free online training to help upskill trainees for the right opportunities. [opportunities, I’m sorry]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI ask the TESDA to come up with special training programs to retool our OFWs so they can find employment opportunities here at home. I am also calling on the CHED for scholarship programs for the qualified dependents of our OFWs. I direct the Department of Agriculture and DTI to come up with agri-business and entrepreneurship projects to help displaced OFWs rebuild their livelihood. Further, I ask the LANDBANK and other government financial institutions to continue providing low-interest loans to our\\nOFWs. Sa mga kababayan ko na naghihirap sa ibang bansa, nandito ang inyong gobyerno para matulungan kayo at inyong mga pamilya, lalo na sa panahong ito. []\\nThe government will intensify its efforts to help businesses, especially our micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs, by providing responsive government assistance and services, capitalization, and business operations support as we adapt to the next normal. []\\nNananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors – nananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors: malasakit at Bayanihan po sana ang pairalin natin ngayon. This is not the time to drive away lessees. During normal times they were the primary source of your income stream. Now, it‘s time to be fair and compassionate. Come up with amenable arrangement with your\\ntenants. Huwag po natin silang ipagtabuyan, tanggalan ng tubig, kuryente, at bubong. Commercial establishments are requested to give grace periods [or] allow deferment of payments, especially for MSMEs that were forced to close down during the quarantine period. Let us help them\\nrecover. []\\nWe pump-primed the recovery and rehabilitation of MSMEs. The DTI, through the Small Business Corporation, set up the PhP1-billion COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program to provide zero-interest loans for MSMEs affected by the pandemic. As of July 10, 2020, over 2,600 loan applications worth [PhP182.5 million] have been approved. We are optimistic that this initiative will help our MSMEs stabilize and recover from their losses.\\nI also enjoin the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and banks operating in the country to provide regulatory relief for our MSMEs and allow loan payment extensions, without incurring penalties and charges. [] We need your help to prevent the collapse of companies saddled with accumulated amortizations and payables caused by the closure of their businesses at the height of the strict quarantine periods.\\nAs we embark on these efforts towards inclusive recovery, we should acknowledge that all forms of government support will go to naught if the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnew MSMEs do not thrive because of lack of consumer support. Ito ang panahon para suportahan natin ang ating mga kababayan [] na nagnenegosyo at gumagawa ng mga produktong sariling atin.\\nIn the same manner, the tourism and recreation industries, which are among the hardest hit by the pandemic, count on our full support. While we slowly try to put the fun back in our local travels, the national government agencies and LGUs must harmonize their policies to boost tourism [while] ensuring everyone‘s well-being. We enjoin our people to help boost the economy by traveling locally [] [local na lang] once the necessary systems are in place.\\nThe DoST offers its Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program to enable businesses to access training that will help them transition to online and contactless operations.\\nNow more than ever, we need to protect our consumers. I direct the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure the empowerment of Filipinos on their consumer rights, and coordinate strategies between public and private organizations in building a fair, safe, resilient, and sustainable economy. []\\nThere are welcome developments for the e-Commerce industry. But major economic activities take place in a borderless environment with meager regulatory controls. They expose consumers to various risks related to security, data privacy, and misrepresentation.\\nWe must patrol the country‘s cyberspace and enforce online consumer and data protection and privacy laws. We must run after online scammers and those undermining the people‘s trust in online transactions. We must continue to protect Filipinos in the new normal and remind the world that we are responsible stewards of data. I am committed to protect both the physical and digital lives of our law-abiding countrymen. []\\nThe national government shall lead the way in our transition to online systems. I reiterate my call for all government instrumentalities to implement systems that shall make physical queuing a thing of the past.\\nPanahon na para mawala [] na ang pila para mapagsilbihan ang gobyerno nang walang kahirapan para sa tao. The DILG, DBM, and the ARTA, along with all agencies and instrumentalities of government, are hereby directed to make [all] possible services available online. We need to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadjust to and adopt a paper-less type business and work performance. We need e-governance [to provide] our people with the services they need [from] the comfort of their homes or workplaces. It will enable our bureaucracy to better transition into in the ‘new normal’ and cut or minimize red tape.\\nUntil the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face- to-face teaching or learning unless [all] risks of exposure to sickness are eliminated. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our students and teachers. []\\nIyong…. About two weeks ago, I — I seemed to have said that I would allow the face-to-face classes to resume. But we were talking actually of January because my thinking is that by September, we would have the vaccine. How to get it from the producers or from other governments is really something which we have to deal with because everyone — the… It’s a global need and everyone will go for it.\\nBut let me just mention it in passing that about four days ago, I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first or if it is needed, if we have to buy it, that we will be granted credit so that we can normalize as fast as possible.\\nLife that is lost is lost forever. Courses that are not substantial can be supplemented. Education that is delayed can be recovered.\\nWe must implement online learning, modular learning, and TV- and radio- based broadcast, which students coming from different backgrounds can avail. DepEd will provide printed modules for those who cannot afford online learning.\\nIn support of the Learning Continuity Program through blended learning, we plan to increase the number of schools with ICT equipment in the coming months.\\nThe DepEd and the DICT are building up the Public Education Network or PEN that will connect all public schools and DepEd offices nationwide. We will prioritize the connection of all Last Mile Schools and those with no electricity supply can have it via satellite and energized via solar panels. By 2022,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore I step down, the PEN shall be realized. [] I‘m referring to the program. I will — I will do it.\\nTV frequencies reverted back to the government for whatever cause or reason [shall be used] exclusively to the exclusion of [private] persons or [their] dummies, to cope with the demand of the next normal. These will be used to provide uninterrupted quality education to our children in our shift to e-learning.\\nI am directing Secretary Guevarra, Secretary Dela Peña and Secretary Honasan, in collaboration with Secretary Briones, and Secretary Avisado, together with Secretary Dominguez, to come up with an integrated program and implementation mechanism to ensure that these TV frequencies are fully utilized by government through the facilities of PTV4 for the utmost benefit of the Filipino people. []\\nLet me just — allow me to segue a little bit. For the remaining two years of my term, all that is good that belongs to government, whether it be the airwaves, whether it be the lines, or whatever that is good for the people, will belong to the government and it should be government who should be given the first option to utilize them. Ang sobra, kanila. []\\nI call on our [telecommunication] companies to improve their services lest we be forced to take drastic steps to address the less-than-ideal service that the public is getting from you.\\nAlam mo sisingit na lang ako dito. I am… Sometimes we are a government pictured to be weak and incompetent because we cannot really force our mandate. Alam mo itong nagbibigay ng mga public services, you better improve.\\nHuwag naman ninyo kaming pahintayin sampung taon bago kami makakamit ng mga services that the other countries are enjoying. If it’s just a question of added capitalization or the infusion of money, go and look for it. Maghanap kayo because if you are not ready to improve — anak — I might just as well close all of you and we revert back to the line telephone at kukunin ko ‘yan, i-expropriate ko sa gobyerno.\\nAlam mo itong… I’ll be straight, iyong Smart pati itong Globe, ilang taon na ito, at ang sagot palagi sa akin, “the party cannot be reached.” Eh nasaan pala pumunta ‘yung y*** na ‘yon?\\nEh kung ganoon lang naman ibigay ninyo sa amin, we are a republic, a sovereign country, bear that in mind because the patience of the Filipino\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npeople is reaching its limit, at I will be the one to articulate the anger of the Filipino people. And you might not want what I intend to do with you.\\nKindly improve the services before December. I want to call Jesus Christ to Bethlehem. Better have that line cleared. [] Alam mo sa totoo lang, at the end — naa-ano na ako sa inyo. I have been a citizen of this country and parang nilalaro lang ninyo ang…\\nKayong may pera, p***. May pera kayo? Negosyo kayo. Wala kayong pera? P***, umalis kayo dito. You know, you give us half deals, half-cooked transactions, lousy service. Tapos ang tao nagbabayad.\\nTell us now if you cannot really improve on it because I will work by December. I have two years. The next two years will be spent improving the telecommunications of this country without you. I will find a way. I will talk to Congress and find a way how to do it. []\\nLast year, I said that distributing economic and business activities is imperative to our country‘s sustained and equitable growth. Today I reiterate that statement.\\nI issued Administrative Order No. 18, directing concerned agencies to strengthen the development of Special Economic Zones in areas outside Metro Manila.\\nI also issued Executive Order No. 114 to institutionalize the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa Program. This consolidates and refocuses existing economic and social welfare programs, activities and projects toward the countryside. It also [establishes] an [inter-agency] council, headed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, which will create a framework for the effective implementation of the project. [Kung hindi ninyo ako naiintindihan sa binabasa ko, mas lalo ako.] []\\nIn 2021, we aim to increase access to healthcare services by continuously hiring and deploying more than 20,000 health professionals. This will augment health workforce in the LGUs, particularly in isolated and disadvantaged areas. We will implement projects to establish and improve Barangay Health Stations, Rural Health Units, and other healthcare facilities.\\n[But] we [still] need to address internal security. We are pursuing a whole- of-nation approach to bring peace and order and development in the countryside. We need to provide interventions and implement the Barangay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelopment Program. This would provide cleared and threatened communities and… This refers to a program where the Armed Forces would play a vital role in the one-nation approach. This is what simply — mean by this. And that everyone, every agency of the government including the Armed Forces of the Philippines should participate. And I am aware of the skirmishes and the assassination of our soldiers and I said, ―Correct this so that we can proceed with the barangay implementation as fast as possible.‖\\nWe have made significant strides in the past four years, but we need the support of local government leaders. We need your help to implement the Barangay Development Program.\\nCertain sectors expressed concerns when I declared martial law in Mindanao and its extension three times. But 2019 ended without my office requesting any further extension.\\nMartial law in Mindanao ended without abuses by the civilian sector, by the police, by the military. [] It ended because this time I know that they know how to love the country.\\nI thank Congress for its support to this administration‘s programs. Congress has been very productive. But much more remains to be done.\\nYou know actually my speech if you followed it carefully, it‘s all a plea to Congress to do this, to do that, to make a law or craft a whatever.\\nAnd this one, I strongly urge Congress to pass a law establishing the Department of Overseas Filipinos [focused] solely on addressing the concerns of Filipinos abroad and their families.\\nI reiterate the swift passage — before that — before this… Kawawa kasi itong ating mga overseas. If it‘s only an office there in the Labor department they are overworked or for whatever reason, their needs, their pleas are not really attended to with dispatch and with care. OFW pati itong ano ngayon ito ̳yung sinabi ko kanina, they — I… I will go for it. We will need it to help them.\\nI reiterate the swift passage of a law reviving the death\\npenalty [] by lethal injection for crimes specified under the Comprehensive Dangerous [Drugs] Act of 2002. I did not hear so much clapping so I presume that [] they are not interested. Wala kang… Someday I‘ll tell you the story what happened to the Philippines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHindi ngayon. But when I‘m — sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo bakit nagkaganito ‘yung droga ng Pilipinas. Why the drug syndicates continue to operate just like the countries of Colombia, Mexico, and it is being played inside the national penitentiaries. Para tayong — talagang binababoy tayo. Sabihin ko sa inyo. But this is not a time for storytelling. SONA kasi ito so dito na lang.\\nThis law will not only help us deter criminality but also save our children from the dangers posed by illegal and dangerous drugs.\\nMay I be allowed with the indulgence of the body, itong bakit talaga ako galit sa droga. Let us make this a semi-formal speech. Alam mo kasi limang pamilya members o anim or pito, pagka bumagsak ̳yung tatay to drugs, the family crumbles. There‘s no more home to them. Droga, and if he‘s receiving a salary naglala — nagtatrabaho sa pantalan, 300 a day, tapos ang shabu is sold at two. He has about 100 to bring home. Kaya pagka ganun nagaaway- away na, ang mga bata hindi nakakapag-aral, ̳yung iba ligaw na mga babae into early prostitution kung ano-ano nangyari. Hindi lang alam nitong mga — – na this is happening all over the country everyday. And what is really very tragic is this, when the family starts to crumble, there‘s no home, and invariably the wife would look for another… Now the husband will look for a job usually easily doon sa abroad. At ̳yung asawa aalis, ̳yung bana — lalaki nasa droga, ̳yung mga anak iniiwan sa kapitbahay, sa kapatid. And the ferocity of the laws of the Filipino family home has been destroyed. Kaya kung anong mangyari nito the wife works in the Middle East. I am not zeroing on any particular country mind you. But alam naman natin there are tribes in the Middle East which would allow rape as part of the territory of being a househelp. Kasama ̳yan, kasama talaga ̳yan. So iyan ang mahirap diyan. You have a wife there being crucified, being used. Magpadala ng pera tapos ang mga anak nasa shabu na rin kasi these are the guys that the shabu people would really you know they stick by them until it crumbles, the resistance. And then you have plenty of this all over the country. Hindi lang nila alam ̳yung sinasabi nila na misery sa itong human rights, plus 10 ̳yan. Not to count the victims of crimes perpetrated by people addicted to shabu. That is the reason why I‘m so vicious in my — galit talaga ako kasi nilalaruan tayo. Well, I don‘t know any other president might — pero ako ayaw ko ̳yon. Ayaw kong lalaruan ang Pilipino. Do not do it in my country because I will really kill you. That is a commitment.\\nOwning safe, decent and affordable housing is every Filipino‘s dream. But the housing market remains inaccessible to most of our countrymen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI renew my call for Congress to pass the National Housing Development bill and the Rental Housing Subsidy bill. These will enable all Filipinos— regardless of social status—to live in decent homes where their families can lead meaningful lives.\\nI also call on Congress to amend Republic Act No. 10912 [or] the Continuing Professional Development Act of 2016. In this time of great pandemic and forthcoming reconstruction, requiring our professionals to undergo seminars is burdensome and not realistic. This must end.\\nIto pang isa, there are — may mga profession… Isingit ko na lang lahat tutal this is to inform the nation. May mga profession na they would require — I think it‘s the nurses — they would require them to come to Manila to retrain and — for another round of expenses. Itong mga seminar-seminar na ito dapat mahinto. I don‘t know in other provinces [] but during my time ̳yang — [ano ‘tong sa barangay na?] barangay expeditions ng mga opisyal, hininto ko rin ̳yan. Which reminds me, I will act on this also in due time.\\nWe hail our health professionals as heroes. Now is the time to pass the Advanced Nursing — iyan ho — Nursing Education Act and the law instituting the Medical Reserve Corps.\\nCOVID-19 will not only be the last pandemic. We need to create a National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better respond to future outbreaks. We count on Congress‘ full support. You can just let it remain for a while in the Department of Health kung wala pang pera but you have to expand the services or it will also entail a little bit of money but not really as much as expensive when you set up a department.\\nIn the long term, we are looking into the creation of the National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better prepare for pandemics, protect lives, and allow development to proceed even in the worst of times. We are counting on the full support of Congress for this critically important endeavor.\\nI don‘t know but I‘ll leave it to Congress to really… It‘s another department. There seems that it could be a multilayer redundant thing between the health and the proposed department.\\nI call on Congress to prioritize the passage of a law for the Unified System of Separation, Retirement and Pension of the Military and Uniformed Personnel without however diminishing the benefits that our uniformed personnel are\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nentitled to under existing laws. [] There is a need to adjust the pension system which will be applicable only to newly-hired uniformed personnel so as not to cause a ―ballooning effect‖ against the budget of the military in the years to come and yet maintain the pension benefits of those already in service under the present law. This issue needs a solution\\nnow. Umpisahan natin ngayon para hindi na maging problema sa susunod na mga taon.\\nI want to… You know one of the… This is not politicking, I am not running. I cannot run anymore. Iyong dinoble ko ̳yung suweldo ng pulis pati army it was really a clarion call para for them also to have a decent life and they are able to get the things which ordinarily cannot be reached by any government employee. Ang akin doon is ̳yung corruption that maybe it might be a vain attempt but maybe dagdagan ang suweldo para it would be a hedge against corruption.\\nWe must also modernize the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Bureau of Immigration with urgency.\\nAlam mo sa Davao and if you go there I can show you, one of the serviceable trucks, fire trucks that we have in the City of Davao… Of course ang city mayroon ng sarili aside from the Bureau of Fire — Bureau of Fire which is really national, mayroon ‘yung Bureau of Fire. Would you believe it? Serviceable still. Ang pangalan ng truck, Studebaker. Ang katawan — ang talagang matatag ang katawan. Kaya ang makina, Isuzu. [] Pero okay pa rin. It can put out fire. Totoo. This is how this Bureau of Fire issue na medyo na — na-overlook natin nang matagal.\\nI emphasize the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. Our people‘s safety cannot be delegated to a council or commission. Equally important is the establishment of evacuation centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country. We must act [now] before another major disaster shakes [us] into action.\\nThe problem is disaster and even a fire cannot be — make — they cannot make a study for projection when the earthquake would suddenly come and make a big crack there. Hindi natin alam talaga.\\nAng ibig kong sabihin, this will require more than just one brainwork kung paano talaga itong how to prevent or avoid disaster. It will be… By the way, just before starting, I was tempted to say it pero baka magtindigan kayo. It will be all right for me if Bong Go will just stay. Wala akong problema. Kasi sabi ko na this piece of speech of mine would be one of the longest SONAs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat I will deliver. Nakita ko ‘yung page pagbigay sa akin. Iyong ibang input, akin. But ‘yung iba lahat. Ang nangyari po, binalik ko sa kanila. ―Make it short.‖ Pagbalik sa akin, mas makapal na. “Naku, p***** i**.” Eh di nandiyan na ngayon. Ito na ngayon.\\nThe responsible extraction and equitable distribution of natural resources remain among my non-negotiables. I reiterate the need for the passage of the National Land Use Act which has been pending for decades. Pakisilip lang ho ninyo ‘yan.\\nFor the rest of my term, I hope to see concerted efforts in protecting the environment.\\nThe rehabilitation of Boracay Island showcased our resolve to safeguard the environment. [] Boracay is doing well because of its scenery. If it‘s only a coconut and a black — white sand and water, wala ̳yan. Pero you add the — the visitors there, then it becomes a very tempting destination.\\nWe have seen the remarkable reemergence of the Island back to its former glory. I want this sustained. I ask Congress to enact a law creating — importante ito — the Boracay Island [Development] Authority or BIDA. We need it.\\nI cannot stress enough the importance of agriculture. The growth of our economy depends on a robust agricultural sector.\\nWe must utilize the coconut — ito, isa — we must utilize the [coco levy funds] for the welfare our coconut farmers and the development of our coconut industry. I urge everybody — both of the Executive Department pati ito — that ito ‘yung pera na nakuha doon sa na-sequester. And itong perang malaking ito, gagamitin ito for the welfare of the farmers.\\nThe problem is, we can no longer trace who are the farmers of yesterday. Marcos was — Marcos is a distant star. We do not know. Ako, alam ko because we had a little piece also that was covered by the land reform. Hindi na natin malaman kung sino ang may-ari.\\nSo I think Congress should look again and try to sort out how best the money can be utilized. I will not make any suggestion but I leave it to Congress to decide what to do with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers‘ Trust Fund. Tulungan natin ang ating mga magsasaka pagka hindi mawawala ‘yang pera, bilyon ‘yan. [] Jusko po. Well anyway the… We have learned so many lessons along the way.\\nI am also requesting Congress to pass the Rural Agricultural and Fisheries Development Financing System Act.\\nWe aim to provide adequate, accessible and affordable food for every Filipino [family] through the Plant, Plant, Plant Program. [] After the Build, Build, Build… I think this is easier to achieve. A few good men — a few good regional directors, DAR and the dedicated workers down below could make this thing a success. Mas madali ito kaysa Build, Build, Build. Ito Plant, Plant, Plant lang eh. It is more of a the — well, how you try to convince the farmers to cooperate with government for their benefit.\\nThis PhP66-billion agricultural stimulus package will help the agriculture and fisheries sector recover. I hope so. []\\nWe need to build trust and confidence in online transactions, stronger protection for online consumers and enabling measures for online businesses is needed through the enactment of an Internet Transactions Act\\n(ITA). [] This is very good.\\nI thus direct the Department of Trade and Industry and other relevant [government] agencies to work closely with Congress in ensuring that the provisions of the proposed bill are responsive to the needs of the consumers while promoting the growth of e-Commerce in the country. [] If you are tired of clapping, you just say so. I can make a\\nshortcut. [] Pabilisan lang ‘yan.\\nOn the path to better governance, we travel with others. Partners – both old and new – have helped. For bolstering our antiquated public health system, for bringing home our laid off Filipinos overseas, for filling in supply gaps for crucial medical supplies and equipment and staple food, for these and many more, the Philippines thanks all friendly nations. We will never forget your kindness and your timely support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin ASEAN and beyond, the Philippines will continue to work with partners to address global perils and ramp up cooperation to secure for our peoples, greater peace, progress and prosperity.\\nThe Filipino nation claims its rightful place in the community of sovereign states. Thus, we will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy. Let me be very clear about this.\\nMay I cut my prepared speech? Alam mo, I read a little over three weeks or last month na the Americans would — intends to go back to Subic.\\nI will just put on record my thoughts. I have nothing against America, I have nothing against China but if you put bases here, you will double the spectacle of a most destructive thing just like Manila during the Second World War — during the retaking of this city. One of the most devastated cities in the world.\\nKaya maglagay-lagay ka ng base at this time, this will ensure if war breaks out, because there would be atomic arsenals brought in, this will ensure the extinction of the Filipino race.\\nWe worked without fail to protect our rights in the South China Sea, neither beholden nor a pawn to anyone. We broadened the boundaries of Philippine diplomacy. We built productive ties with everyone willing to engage us on the basis of equality and mutual respect. And, we redefined our relationships with our most important partners, placing the country in a far better position to advance our interests in an evolving regional order and emerging global problems. []\\nNow, plenty of critics, both sides, claim about nothing has been done to retake forcefully or physically the South China Sea.\\nAlam mo, unless we are prepared to go to war, I would suggest that we better just call off and treat this, I said, with diplomatic endeavors.\\nChina is claiming it. We are claiming it. China has the arms, we do not have it.\\nSo, it is simple as that. They are in possession of the property. It will remain a property of a — if you’re a lawyer, property rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are — it has nothing to do with the Philippine Laws of Property but it‘s akin to — they are in possession. So what can we do? We have to go to war and I cannot afford it. Maybe some other president can, but I cannot. Inutil ako diyan, sabihin ko sa inyo. And I’m willing to admit it. Talagang inutil ako diyan. Wala akong magawa. I cannot…\\nThe moment I send my Marines there at the coastal shores of Palawan, tinamaan ng cruise missile lahat iyan. Hindi pa nga naka-set sail iyan eh, sabog na.\\nLet me say again that victory in the global battle against COVID-19 would take longer than we expect. Everyone‘s cooperation is needed. I know that you, the Filipino people, have sacrificed a lot. But we have no other choice but to work together and to do even more.\\nI must admit that our actions have been far from perfect — totoo iyan I admit it — and there could be improvements here or there—but all of us in government, including myself, assure you that we will not stop until we get things right and better for you. []\\nI know that many of you are worried not only about health and safety but also about our ability to move around and ride public transportation; the depletion of your savings due to the rising cost of goods; and the loss of your incomes due to uncertainties in your jobs and livelihood. I assure you that your government will [squarely address] these problems and challenges to overcome them and proceed to the ̳new normal‘.\\nMarami ho talagang mawawalaan ng — those for the middle-income. They buy a car on installment basis. If you cannot keep up with the amortization, you’ll lose it — you‘ll lose the car and you are forced to ride on public utilities.\\nConcomitantly, didiretso rin itong mga criminal na rarami at crimes will increase. But let me assure you, for as long as I am President, there can never be a runaway crime in any of our cities. Hindi ako papayag ng ganun. I can assure you we will remain peaceful — relatively\\npeaceful. [] Hindi naman very peaceful. Pero kung sabihin mo na kagaya ng holdup dito, holdup, ah… Alam naman nila kung ano mangyayari. You know what will happen to you.\\nI am addressing myself to the criminals. You commit holdups, you commit rapes, you commit all sorts of things and you harm the public, then kaaway mo na ako. Kapag bumalik kayo sa dati kagaya noon, patong-patong na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnaman ang patay dito. Sigurado hahanapin ko kayo. Do not ever go back to your old ways. Maghanap na lang kayo ng anong trabaho diyan. Magtiis kayo.\\nTo open up the economy to pre-Covid-19 levels at this time is not an option because whatever good it can produce will only be gobbled up, or be outweighed, by the bad it will generate. Sometimes, haste does make waste. The recent upsurge of infections when we opened little windows to the resumption of business is proof of that.\\nI am happy that I have talked to you today. You know, in other places they opened up too early too soon. America is one. China — well fortunately, it was arrested on time. China and the rest for those who opened up and those who do not follow the protocols of the — at least the World Health Organization — they are suffering and they have at least 140 deaths.\\nAng Amerika nagkukulang sila lahat. No nation on earth was really prepared for COVID. No amount of preparation because that kind of microbes visits about once every 100 years. Wala man ̳yung — mga tatay natin, what they suffered was Second World War, but tayo…\\nWe are not ready and therefore we will not gamble with the lives and health of the people. Certainly, no one would want to end up on the negative side of the equation. Not me, not us.\\nAll I ask is that you continue to put your faith in your government and work with us in achieving what is best for our country and our people. Together, let us do — mahirap basahin kasi dito eh — the most that we can to ensure that the health, safety and well-being of every Filipino—especially those severely affected —are taken care of.\\nTogether, we shall fight this pandemic with the same fervor as our campaign against illegal drugs, criminality, insurgency, and corruption in high places and entrenched parochial interests.\\nAs a government worker, I am addressing each and every Filipino that the government cannot do this without your help. More than ever, we need to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreinvigorate the deep-seated Filipino spirit of pakisama and malasakit within each and everyone of us.\\nWe are being — we are being tested, as a people and as a nation. Worse times loom ahead. But I do hope that this spirit of solidarity and unity will serve as the drumbeat to which we shall march in unison in our quest for the light at the end of the tunnel.\\nI appeal to each and every Filipino, let us take care of one another. Ito ang panahon para magtulungan. Hindi ito ang panahon para maglamanan — maglaman — lamang-lamangan — lamang. Mamang p*** — dila\\nko. [] Hindi maglamang — at pagkakaisa.\\nMy faith in the Filipino innate patience, resilience and determination to bounce back is unwavering. Let us share our blessings with those who have little and those who have none. This is the time to bring out the best in us.\\nThe woes that weigh heavily upon our shoulders may bend our back, but they shall not bend or break our spirit.\\nFrom the rubbles of adversity, a more resilient and stronger nation built on Bayanihan and Pagkakaisa shall rise.\\nTogether, we shall overcome.\\nBefore I… Pardon the time but it was really the allotted time for my speech. I would just like to give a statement between — between us sa gobyerno kung hindi tayo nagkakaintindihan.\\nYou know Drilon, stand it — he was defending… I would like to ask Drilon, were you a part of ACCRA when this contract of Ayala water was being drafted?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd why are you fumigating? Bakit kasi ikaw lang ang galit? Na sabi mo na dynasty-dynasty. You are a hypocrite. You know that you cannot pass an anti-dynasty law. Ikaw ang nandiyan sa Congress, ̳di ikaw ang mauna dito.\\nBut you know, to take it against me for protecting my country is something which I really resent. Alam mo you described using the dictionary the synonym ng mga oligarchs, oligarchy, kung ano, then you proceeded to characterize everyone every — every name and then said that oligarchy is not bad at all because sa — not all oligarchies are bad. True.\\nBut ito, to my countrymen, the oligarchy that exists in this country is the oligarchy that existed during the Spanish time. And the Spanish lands and the friar lands and all the benefits that were passed on to the Insulares who did not go back to Spain or to the Spaniards and into their… But that was long ago, it has been forgotten. This is the oligarchy that controls the Philippines by what? By taking control of the water and the electricity and power. Iyan ang oligarchy mo Drilon. []\\nWala ng oligarchy dito except that. They have controlled. Look at… How can you now craft a new contract? Because I would insist that you pay the billions and billions that you collected.\\nFor example, water treatment. O nandiyan sa kontrata. It‘s in the billing, they are being collected since 1997. Ilang bilyon na nga wala ni isa, not even a faucet was built for a water treatment facility.\\nIyan ang mahirap sa… You do not protect the oligarchs here. You are the one. Ikaw lang mag-isa. And I suspect that you were also the one — or helped when you were there in the ACCRA.\\nWe do not even know the — ang mga abogado sa public documents hindi nga alam. Hindi nga natin alam kung naka-graduate ba o hindi. Wala. Would you think Ayala would get the services of those…? Ayala got ACCRA. ACCRA did it. Ikaw galing ka doon, most of you, more successful lawyers sa corporation, you handle big corporate. Iyan ang mahirap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangga tayo dito. Me, hinawakan ninyo eh. Hindi ka puwede kay… Kita mo noong nag-increase, walang tubig, pinuputol ̳yung tubig, ang tao bumigay kasi hindi puwede man tayo hindi maligo, hindi uminom. Electricity ayaw mo mag-increase. O ayan, wala ka, palaging brownout, lahat.\\nI‘m sorry but I have to say this to you. I do not like it. It‘s not the time for it, but since it is the time for the SONA, for people to know and people to really get the facts, then — and the right of the people to be heard.\\nTayo na naman ang tao magsabi. Hinawakan ninyo ̳yang tubig pati electricity, iyon ang oligarchy talaga. Kaya ako sinabi ko noong kampanya ―corruption is not here.‖ Iyang mga Customs na ̳yan, maliit ̳yan. It‘s there upstairs.

Noong nakita ko ̳yung contract…\\nAt saka ̳yang linya na ano, ̳yung choice — trans — ̳yung linya ng ano, it belongs to government.

[ and cheers] So many — so many beautiful faces and you only have to guess when you see the full face of the person.\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Lord Allan Jay Velasco and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Joseph Ejercito Estrada; the Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the justices of the Supreme Court; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Dean of the Diplomatic Corps His Excellency Archbishop Charles John Brown and the distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps; my fellow government workers; and of course to my lovely wife Honeylet; mga mahal kong kababayan [].\\nWhen I assumed the presidency five years ago, dominant in my mind were dreams and visions of a better life for all Filipinos. I saw them as reachable through the institution of reforms and radical changes in both the structure of government and the mode of governance — changes designed [to yield] responsibility [and] accountability. All in consonance with the truth that public office is a public trust.\\nWhen I ran for the presidency, I just made fundamental promises and strangely you can count them by the fingers of your hand. I made those changes, which I thought that was really at that time doable.\\nTo offer free education — it’s there already — the Universal Health Care [], nandiyan na po; the fight against illegal drugs, [] criminality and corruption; and the development of infrastructure, including free irrigation and other big ticket projects, which I thought I did not have the funds to do it, but per chance, among others, they were done in my term.\\nToday as I approach the end of my term, I have less visions but more remembrances. But mine is not to rue or to second guess what might have been, but to bear and respond with urgency [to the impact] of unforeseen events as they unfold.\\nEven before I took my oath of office, [I] – and everyone else, I suppose – knew the gravity [and] enormity of the problems that the country was facing. And precisely because of that awareness, I was driven to hasten the implementation of changes which I believed the country needed, keeping in mind that the Constitution afforded me only six years to make those changes happen. Making a difference within the constitutional time-frame is what I was up against. But no one gets by legally without worming through the needle’s eye of constitutional imperatives.\\nThat is why I cajoled, I shoved, I pushed, and I tangled with men of wealth and influence who were oblivious to the anguish and pleas of the weak and impoverished. And for that, I was pilloried to no end. But I did not succumb to the attacks. And neither did I allow criticisms, however intense, to dampen my determination and initiatives, because my purpose was pure and unpolluted. []\\nWhile we were busy instituting reforms, the twin ogres of illegal drugs and corruption laid low for a while only to resurface us — still with us, and make no mistake about it corruption is but another term for stealing people’s money, dashing, in its wake, a nation’s goals and aspirations.\\nDue to the brilliant programs and excellent work of our economic managers and the extraordinary cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches of government, our economy, with investor confidence, was poised to leapfrog into the company of the world’s fastest growing economies until the COVID-19 pandemic stalled everything.\\nBe that as it may, allow me this opportunity to extend my personal and the nation’s gratitude to all those who selflessly gave their all in the fight against COVID-19. Our health workers and other frontliners who risked their own safety [] to keep our essential health services and our food supply chain running, [boost] economic activity, and ensure peace and order in our communities.\\nI would like also to extend my deepest appreciation for the generosity of the private sector who came to the government’s aid in fighting COVID-19. [] I am profoundly thankful for your sustained assistance to our fellow Filipinos, [] amidst the same deleterious effect of the pandemic to your respective industries. Let me assure you that the government is committed to assist the private sector to regain the commercial vibrance of the country prior to the pandemic. []\\nTo our local [chief] executives, this pandemic pushed you to step up and deliver responsive assistance. I am glad to have seen you undertake new and heightened responsibilities, working doubly hard to protect your constituents. []\\nTo the international development partners who extended a helping hand amidst the global health emergency, the Philippines remembers your kindness and goodwill with sincere gratitude. []\\nAnd to all of you who answered the call to protect one another by adhering to our nation’s [health] protocols, daghang salamat. []\\nBut then, let me ask, perhaps you and to myself: What exactly is the state of the nation today in the light of the pandemic which has paralyzed business activities and crippled even the strongest of the world’s economies? So where do we go from here?\\n[Looking Back to our Accomplishments]\\nIn my first SONA, I laid down with utmost commitment and resolve the overall direction of my presidency: a comfortable life for all Filipinos anchored on a people-centered approach to development and governance. If I remember correctly, my administration, I said, will implement a human approach to development and governance, in our people’s welfare in the areas of health, free education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for the culture.\\nI bore no illusion that steering the nation towards a comfortable life for every Filipino would be easy. Indeed, the past five years have truly been challenging and humbling. I stand here before you today bearing no conceit, but if there is one thing that I could be proud of is that not once did I waver in doing the unpopular even if it meant upholding the greatest good for the greatest number. []\\nBefore I took office, our country was beset with a communist insurgency scattered across the nation, a separatist movement that sought to divide us on the basis of religion and religious differences, and the proliferation of illegal drugs and criminality.\\nOur armed forces were ill-equipped to deal with internal and external threats, while the police force had been overwhelmed by criminality and the drug trade problem. This is why I made it a priority to strengthen the institution and boost the morale of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the Philippine National Police, and other armed services. []\\nAgain, I thank Congress for working with the executive department in enhancing the capabilities of the AFP and the PNP through our modernization program.\\nIn 2018, we raised the salaries of our military and uniformed policemen and personnel [] to a level commensurate to the critical role they play in upholding national security and maintaining order.\\nI am asking Congress to pass a Unified System for Separation, Retirement and Pension of Military and Uniformed Personnel to maintain [] government fiscal flexibility and provide adequate benefits and remuneration to our men and women in uniform. This shall apply only to the new entrants of the Military and [Uniformed] Services.\\nHindi ho lahat. It cannot be that we have to pay so many, even the salaries of the retired. They get a chunk of the big budget. And if we include the new entrants, the funds available for them would not be enough.\\nIt is also high time for us to pass a law providing Free Legal Assistance to AFP and PNP Officers and Enlisted Personnel [] to help [defend] them from charges arising from incidents related to the performance of official duty. []\\nThe continuous upgrading of our defense capability shall ensure that we shall uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty from external and [internal] security threats, among the new additions. [] We welcomed the country’s two missile-capable warships, to enable us to protect our seas.\\nBy providing them with the necessary equipment, by enhancing their professional capabilities, and looking after the families of the soldiers who would not be longer be in their company. We do not only strengthen our military and police institutions — we also inspire them to serve this nation with the highest degree of loyalty and patriotism. We enabled them to carry out their mandate to defeat all enemies of the state whatever the cost.\\nIndeed, I am proud of the accomplishments of our troops in securing our nation against all threats to our democratic institutions. [] But peace must be realized — peace and security is not only just a military concern. That is why we deviated from the traditional purely military approach in dealing with matters of national security.\\nWith the creation of the National Task Force to End [Local] Communist Armed Conflict or NTF-ELCAC, [] we have made great strides in addressing the root causes of this conflict by empowering our kababayans who have been used by the communists for so many decades.\\nIn our continuing effort to build safe and conflict-resilient barangays, we have worked towards the sustainable rehabilitation and development of communities where the communists used to operate.\\nThrough the NTF-ELCAC, we invested in farm-to-market roads, school buildings, water and sanitation [systems], [] health stations, and livelihood [projects].\\nAlam mo, kasali na tayo dito lahat. Always every law or every regulation must pass Congress, of course, to the President. But sometimes, you know, in our… Well, in the performance of our duties, we encounter the not-so-nice of confronting each other.\\nBut because of these interventions, more than [17,000] former communist rebels have surrendered to the government. They have returned to the fold of the law and are happily reintegrating to [society], [the Enhanced Community Local Integration Program] or E-CLIP. []\\nIt’s either I am talking too fast or too slow or the operator of this thing here is drowsy. [] Maybe because I had so many ad libs along the way. Marami ho akong akin lang. Kaya ‘yung… [] Nahinto ako. When I stop and I process something in my — the gray matter between my ears — hindi humahabol o hindi alam ng operator.\\nHindi bale, ma’am. Mahal pa rin kita. [] Lalaki ba ito o ‘yung mga babae? Kagabi ‘yung mga babae. Sila? O sabihin mo sa kanila makipagkita ako mamaya. I will embrace them for their punctuality in operating this ano — this strange machine that [] gives you the speech.\\nWith the support of our local government units, I am confident that support for the communist movement will continue to erode in the next few months. [] And like the decades-old Moro rebellion in Mindanao, we will also bring an end to the armed struggle of the communists once and for all. []\\nSa totoo lang, itong komunista college pa ako. Hanggang ngayon, ang mga — sige pa rin. So… Speech-speech man lang ito. Kunwari lang pero ang totoo there’s a lot of fighting going on in the countryside. But I’d like to credit the police and the military for destroying so many communist fronts. [] I think they have destroyed more than 15 apparatus of the fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines.\\nAlam mo, mag-istorya muna tayo sa taxation. I’d like to be frank with you. Everybody, as everybody in this country, are paying taxes to the communists. The Communist Party earns billions but pass on a little to their fighting men who die for an ideology that is so rotten and corrupt.\\nThey themselves are pocketing the money and their children are studying in Europe and in other places, which I think none of you here can finance such journey. Iyan ang masakit dito. They collect taxes, support Sison in Netherlands, and they do nothing but bad-mouth the government and mouth the war dogmas and everything.\\nHindi na sila napagod. It’s about 53 years in the making. And until today, the poor people are dying. The cadres and most of them belonging to the indigenous tribes of our country are fighting a losing battle between the communist and the government. They waste lives, they enlist children and they are proud of it, but they deny it.\\nBut when you go to the mountains such as I and Senator Go many times, even during the elections, they were there with so many arms that I think somebody — an idiot here in the Philippines supplied the firearms.\\nI’d like to ask Congress, especially Senator Bato, kindly dig on because we have identified the person who imported the AK-47 into this country on the pretext of using it in the security — providing security and guards in all, in business establishments and for those who can afford their home.\\nThis policeman, I think, is still there. He was a colonel and he is still… Walang nangyari. At maraming sundalong namatay dahil sa mga armas na pinasok nila dito sa Pilipinas.\\nSo that my orders to the — to you, if you see them walking around, kindly shoot them dead. I would be happy. Anyway, you are already charged in the ICC together with me. So what is the problem of adding another one? Another idiot Filipino who has caused great damage to our country. Iyan ho ang totoo diyan. At itong mga pulis…\\nBut let me go back in time. When I first said I will fight drugs in six months, I thought it was like in Davao. You can either coerce, intimidate or bribe them, or give them money, I said, “Lumabas kayo ng Davao. Doon kayo magkalat sa Luzon at sa ibang lugar, huwag dito sa Davao.” Naniniwala naman ang mga ulol at we were able to attain a sense of normalcy in the city. Iyon ho ang totoo.\\nThere are people charged with corruption and even going to prison for just maybe not telling the truth in their itong assets and liabilities, nakukulong. Eh p***… Itong mga pulis who are doing their thing, their drugs, they were the manufacturers and they were the distributor of drugs. When I became President, I asked Dela Rosa — he was the chief of police of my city — I promoted him direct to be PNP chief. Four star na kaagad automatic. But I told them, I told him and the others, “Look for the enemies. Look where — for where they are and if you find them, destroy the apparatus, destroy all from the manufacturers to the peddlers because we are fighting a drug war that was being participated in the business by nine generals of the PNP.”\\nKaya ‘yan ang masakit sa loob ko. I did not know that I was fighting my own government. Customs and everyone else were facilitating the importation of drugs. And one importation, as you can see it every night on TV, the police now seize about almost a billion worth of drugs everyday.\\nAnd if you look at the [8888], there are about a thousand Filipinos arrested everyday by the police in connection with drug trafficking. And that is why I go crazy looking at the situation. They are still around. We do not have the laboratories now because nawala na sila at itong naiwan ngayon are doing the importation.\\nThe citizens of another country cooked their shabu in their — [Anong tawag nitong…?] — in their tugboat or something and they threw out the product in — contained in the plastic bags and with GPS attached to the contraband so that the importers here could find them easily. That is how we are fighting almost losing a battle against drugs.\\nAnd now the [Sinaloa] gangsters of Mexico and the Triad of Laos in that area, they are busy cooking and we have the Filipinos here with no — with nothing in their mind except to destroy a nation — distributes them. That is what I said.\\nI’ve been asked the question and several times I gave the answer. I am a Filipino and I love my country. I do not want my country in disarray because of drugs. I do not want families break up and become dysfunctional. Iyon ang masakit sa akin.\\nWhen there — if you want to destroy a family, look for a way of the member or a resident of that family home, bigyan mo ng droga. ‘Pag nandiyan na ‘yung droga at they are hooked, and that is the end. Sometimes families are separated because of drugs, becomes dysfunctional, at ‘yung mga asawa magpunta doon sa abroad, ika nga, to look for jobs.\\nAnd you know, in the Middle East — I am not attributing it to any particular country — but there are tribes in the Middle East who are employing our Filipina citizens and they are uniform. Everybody who comes here home ask them how many hours of sleep they have? They said it’s only three to four hours and the food is hogwash.\\nAnd they sacrifice because they send money to the families back home and thinking all the time that the money was spent usefully, only to realize when she comes home that that family has already dispersed to nowhere.\\nBakit ‘yan? Because itong mga durugista sa baba, itong peddlers, itong basurero tawag — it’s a street lingo — they look for families na may mga nanay, tatay nagtrabaho — ang tatay or nanay nagtatrabaho sa abroad. And to think na iniiwan nila ang mga anak nila kung saan-saan na lang, to their neighbors at a tender age of three to four, five, it breaks your heart.\\nIiwan lang nila sa kapitbahay kung walang mga relatives. And then when they come back five years, four years after, they now realized that their young sons and daughters have gone into prostitution because of drugs and their boys or the fem — the male are nowhere to be found and into the drug business also. Iyon ang pinakamasakit.\\nMasakit sa akin na ang Pilipina pumunta doon para magtrabaho because sexual abuse in some tribes in the Middle East have this notion that if you are a slave or you are a paid person working for them, sexual abuse becomes part of the territory. Kaya diyan ako pumuputok at nakikita ko ‘yung mga pamilya na sira.\\nAnd to think that they labored without sleep, eating, I said, garbage, and not being allowed to go to their own church to pray for that is prohibited by them. And we have been just because of the money that they get, we just look the other way around. But still being — you know, bothered every night and they… What will happen to the next succeeding group of…? That is why I have in this speech a talk about slavery.\\nPero ‘yan magprangka ako uli, I would never deny and the ICC can record it: Those who destroy my country, I will kill you. And those who destroy the young people of our country, I will kill you. Talagang yayariin kita because I love my country.\\nYou can do it the legal way but it would take you months and years. And you know what? The statistics, I just learned the other night, that plenty of those who are in the middle class have been released from prison despite the fact that they are charged with trafficking, which is non-bailable and most of them are out. Babae pati lalaki ang kaso. And that is why I said I toyed with the idea — I said, if there is still a space — with due respect to the Senate President, he is a good man, he can become a good vice president. He is holy. Ngayon hindi na siya nahuhuli, noon huling-huli siya. But with due respect to Senator Sotto, who is also running for the vice presidency, he is a capable man, a good man and a Filipino. []\\nSige ako tingin sa harap, nandito pala sa likod ko. [] You know when you are old — I have been in politics, mayor for 23 years; five years as a congressman, dito, I worked here; and four years of working as vice mayor for my daughter Sara; and the presidency. I have been in politics almost — 23 plus four, plus four — almost 40.\\nKaya kung — hindi ko na malaman ang seat arrangement dito. Hindi ko alam nandoon pa ang mga Senate President pati… Buti’t na lang hindi ko sinali si Velasco. Baka hindi na ako makabalik doon maya. ‘Di bale, diretso na ako uwi.\\nI have said many times before: The bloodshed caused by the separatist movement in Mindanao is all about correcting the historical injustices suffered by the Moro people since the period of colonization. With the help of Congress, we were able to pass the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, [] finally fulfilling a promise that was decades in the making.\\nOur victory in Marawi is also a testament to how the Filipino’s patriotism is far stronger than any extremist group. As I have said before, many times, there is no room for lawlessness in this country. []\\nRebuilding a better Marawi remains today, still not completed. To Task Force Bangon Marawi, we need to race against time. And you have to finish the necessary work to rehabilitate the war-torn city and bring back its [displaced] families back home.\\nNow let me talk again about the drugs. I was just ahead because I was talking something else. Nag-segue ako.\\nWhile we have made great strides in ending rebellion and insurgency in various parts of the country, we still have a long way in our fight against the proliferation of drugs. This problem has hounded our country for several decades — destroying families and degrading the moral fiber of our society.\\nWhen I assumed office, I committed to end this problem at the soonest possible time. We launched an unprecedented war against the illegal drugs and to destroy their apparatus that permeated every level and sector of society. We waged war on the manufacturers, the financiers, the suppliers, the peddlers, and the entire syndicates and, more importantly, their protectors in government. We have rescued and reformed drug dependents because of their idiotic sense of decency by [launching] interventions and building facilities not only for their rehabilitation, but also to prepare them to reintegrate into society.\\nOur unyielding campaign led to the surrender of millions of drug dependents; and neutralization, capture and prosecution of thousands of drug personalities; the dismantling of illegal drugs and syndicates and the drug laboratories; the extensive drug-[clearing] of communities down to the barangay-level, and the cutting of narco politics.\\nYou know, just allow me a little bit of your time. Wala naman siguro kayong lakad ngayon, unless na you want to — unless you have this appointment with… I’m sure hindi babae ‘yan. That would be a sexist statement. But kung nagmamadali talaga, halos tumatakbo, babae ‘yan. Kung naglalakad lang nang natural, medyo less important ‘yan. Ganoon ‘yan pero dito, wala. I am not making any sexist — I’m just saying — I’m just saying the truth. What is the truth? It’s there for all to see.\\nLet me talk about our quest for infrastructure development.\\nFive years ago, the first thing I made sure was to increase our infrastructure spending to an average of five percent of the country’s GDP. This is significantly higher than the infrastructure spending of each and [of the] past four administrations. Thanks to the comprehensive tax reform program that enabled us to fund critical infrastructure projects. Today, we can see the tangible results all around.\\nMRT-3, with its frequent breakdowns and unloading of passengers midrail, was a horror that was for the daily commuters to endure in the past.\\nNow, MRT-3 no longer unloads passengers but to their destinations. The waiting time between trains has been significantly reduced. [From] 10 trains running at only 30 kilometers per hour before, now [MRT-3] runs 23 trains at 60 kilometers per hour. [] We have taken away the misery of public commuting.\\nWe also pursued the completion of the LRT-2 East Extension Project. [] By extending Line 2 and adding two more stations, we have reduced travel time between Manila and Antipolo from the usual two or three hours to only just 40 minutes. []\\nThanks to our partnership with the private sector, we were able to open Stage 3 of the Metro Manila Skyway in January this year. [] This decongested EDSA and other major roads in Metro Manila. []\\nOn Independence Day last month, we also inaugurated the Kalayaan Bridge, part of the BGC-Ortigas Center Link Project, [] which will reduce the usual one hour travel time between the two business districts to just 12 minutes.\\nBeyond Metro Manila, we are pursuing several high-impact projects that will be completed within my term and perhaps in the following years. It’s a question of money.\\nJust this July, we inspected the newly-built passenger terminal building of the Clark International Airport. []\\nThe new and modern passenger terminal is equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology. This can accommodate 8 million passengers, alleviate air traffic congestion at the NAIA Airport, as well as serve as a major growth driver and gateway for Northern and Central Luzon. []\\nMadali man ang magpakpak, ang basa ang mahirap. [cheers and ]\\nTo help promote equitable development, we also completed several roads leading to important trade corridors. Last year, we completed the construction of the Poro Point Freeport Zone Road in La Union, which improved — [] nakita na ninyo ‘yan? Wala, sige lang pakpak. [] You do not even have a picture of what I am talking about, I’m sure — to improve access to prime spots for investments and tourism in the Poro Point area.\\nWe also completed the Junction Lanao-Pagadian-Zamboanga City Road, which will provide easier access to farms and easily transport their agricultural products at low cost and in great quantities to industries and economic zones located in Diplahan, Zamboanga Sibugay. []\\nThe Sorsogon City in Bicol, inuna namin ‘yan kasi mahal ko ang mga Bicolano. [] Pangatawanan ninyo ‘yang pakpak ninyo ha, baka…\\nThe Sorsogon City Coastal By-Pass Road is targeted for completion by the end of 2021 while the Davao City Coastal Road will be completed by 2023.\\nBakit? Why? Why is Davao last? Kasi sinabi ko sa kanila, unahin ninyo ‘yung buong Pilipinas. During the initial years of my presidency, I told the economic managers and the DPWH, pati si Art Tugade sa Transportation, “Unahin ninyo ang Luzon at ibang areas sa Mindanao. Do not look into the political entrails of the city and the other provinces.” Sinadya ko talaga na ipanghuli ang Davao.\\nKaya ang — for the Davaoeños, you must understand that we cannot really unahin natin iyong — kasi taga diyan ako eh. Kung hindi ako sigurado taga-Davao, tapos na ‘yan pareho ng iba. Kaya lang sinabi ko, make Davao the last priority. []\\nTotoo ‘yan. Sorsogon is a — a little politics, but that’s the territory of our Vice President Leni Robredo. Are you here, Ma’am? Ah, Zoom. Mayroon ho kayong… [] Sorsogon at iba pa.\\nWe have inaugurated new highways, roads and skyways. We have bought new trains. These are all testament that we have greatly eased the grueling experience of traveling and commuting.\\nAnd to sustain our momentum in infrastructure development, I have directed the DPWH, DOTr, NEDA, Department of Finance and DBM to be on full speed to ensure that our flagship projects will be completed within my term, [] especially those that would help disperse economic activity outside the densely populated Metro Manila.\\nI thus earnestly call upon our LGU and private sector partners to help us [go on] full speed towards the realization of our flagship [infrastructure projects] and others.\\nLet me talk about — let me dwell about governance.\\nAs we improved connectivity, we worked towards greater convenience for our travelers. We have extended the validity of Philippine passports to 10 years to lessen the burden of our [international] travelers and OFWs. []\\nWe have also gone beyond merely addressing the three million backlog of driver’s licenses in 2016. []\\nWe also extended for the new cards the validity of the driver’s license to five years, and addedly, we shall begin the issuance of these driver’s licenses within 10 years — which would be good for 10 years if there is no traffic violation. []\\nSo punta ka doon sa LTO, maybe you have a good sight. Mayroong ano ‘yan eh, I think there’s an examination there somewhere to test your ability to drive safely. And you go back 10 years after, and you think that you good — you still have a good sight and your reflexes are still good.\\nTen years, maraming banggaan ‘yan, sigurado ako. You know, after 10 years, no after five, there should be a stricter measure to issue the 10 years validity of a driver’s license by imposing stringent requirements to test the essential functions of eyesight, then the hearing. Iyong iba hindi na nakakarinig ng silbato eh.\\nAnd so I have to… You know, 10 years is too long. I like it, it’s good. But we should have, as I said, in five years, we should go there for a medical makeover. Tingnan lang kung kaya pa mag…\\nNot only did we extend the validity of licenses and passports, we also sought to make long lines a thing of the past by streamlining government processes. These efforts are embodied in the Ease of Doing Business Act, which Congress passed [in] 2018. Thank you, Congress. []\\nSa inyo ‘yun. Ako ang nagpirma pala, ako nag-execute, pakpak rin kayo. [] Dapat ganoon ang SONA, sabihin mo lahat at sabihin mo na your — not really your qualms, but your misgivings somewhere there.\\n[Government] transactions will be further streamlined with the roll-out of the Philippine Identification System or the PhilSys through the Philippine Identification System Act. With this, we hope to facilitate better access [to basic services] for all Filipinos even in the far-flung areas. I want to say something about this but I’m taking too long, you know.\\nWe also ensured the modification of the Salary Schedule for Civilian Government Personnel through the Salary Standardization Law 5 [] — a necessary measure for our civil servants to recognize their work and accomplishments as well as a gesture of gratitude and good will.\\nWe have this legacy and we hope to pass on the establishment of the Central Business Portal, a single site for all business-related transactions such as securing business permits, licenses, and clearances. Launched earlier this year, it shall elevate our global standing in the doing business arena and improve our country’s competitiveness.\\nAlam mo ito, ‘yung queuing, when I was a mayor — I don’t know, but maybe a legislator or a senator or a congressman, well not really he is higher than the others, but kung dumaan ka as a local government employee worker, just like me, for 23 years, itong queuing matagal ko na ito.\\nIn Davao, ang passport issuances nandoon sa likod ng SM. Isang gabi nag-motor ako, nakita ko ‘yung mga paa sa semento. So I was thinking, “Anong nangyari dito?” So nagbaba ako, sabi ko, “Bakit dito kayo natutulog?” Sabi nila, “You know, Mayor, ang pagbukas niyan kailangan nakapila na kami, ‘pag hindi, sunod — ibang araw na naman kami.”\\nSo I called for the chief of office and I said, “Look I may not be the person above you supervising, but make sure that this thing will not happen tomorrow, as in tomorrow.” Tapos tinawagan ko ang — itong ano, sabi ko, “Why don’t you give cards?” Kung marami sila paglinya, may maglakad na marshal, “O ito, ikaw bukas at 4 p.m.” So you have to study the time and motion of people doing work.\\nSabi ko, “Ayaw ko dito sa Davao.” Because in Davao — in Mindanao, nasa Davao ang ano eh ang issuances ng passport. So ngayon pagka-Presidente ko, sabi ko, “Ayaw ko nang makita ‘yan.” Not during my time, not during my time. Maghanap ka ng ibang panahon. Ayusin ninyo ‘yan. I do not want people queuing under the heat of the sun and rain.\\nKaya sabi ko, “’Di magbigay kayo ng card.” They should go to one window, magkuha kayo kung kailan sila makabalik. So divide — I said, study your time and the motion of, you know, the process of… And dito nangyari na because I insisted.\\nToday, there is no more queuing, especially in the National Office — Statistics Office, nakita ko. Talagang sabi ko na, “Either you fix that thing or I will resign tomorrow because I could not bear to see those people. Hindi sa panahon ko. Kung hindi ko madala, hindi ko man kayo mapatay, hindi ko kayo mabugbog, ako ang aalis sa gobyerno.” Sabi ko, “Ayusin ninyo ‘yan. Hindi ko gustong makita ‘yan.”\\nSince 2016, the Office of the President has issued 138 Executive Orders, 43 Administrative Orders, 86 Memorandum Circulars, 52 Memorandum Orders and 1,038 Proclamations. These issuances have [become] integral guideposts in government administration and development agenda.\\nThe Office of the President has demonstrated careful stewardship of the powers, by initiating reforms. We upgraded and improved the systems and processes to ensure that it can provide the best service to the institution of the presidency and the offices under it and ultimately the Filipino people.\\nTo further promote transparency and accountability in government, we also issued the order on Freedom of Information [that] opens up the records, [] transactions, decisions and issuances of all government agencies. In relation to this, we also have the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission that is tasked to run after corrupt and erring government officials and bring them to justice. []\\nAlam mo, I don’t know if you perhaps have come to know about this. I have ‘yung Pastillas sa ano sa airport. There were 43 personnel involved. I fired them all. Talagang pinaalis ko sa gobyerno. Nagbalot pa nga ako ng pera sa pastillas. Sabi ko kay — “Magbalot ka, lagyan mo ng pera kay ito ang ipakain ko sa kanila.”\\nTinawag ko 43 of them from the Immigration. Mabuti’t na lang nandiyan si Justice Secretary Guevarra so that prevented me from doing it because kung hindi siya dumating — and I never expected him to be there — bigyan ko isa’t isa ‘yung papel at ipakain ko talaga ‘yung pera sa kanila. “Gusto mo ng pera? Hala kainin mo.” That is the best way of… Then, you fire them.\\nCustoms, 73 plus 42. And everyday you have about — we have dismissed about 200 government personnel but some I did not allow the publication because ayaw — may mga pamilya eh.\\nSo of late, ‘yung sabi nila na huwag na lang ano kasi nasasaktan ‘yung mga pamilya. So ngayon, wala na. I have stopped it. But there is no — there is no saying that we cannot reimpose it again for all of these idiots. I still have about a year to go. I will — I will reach you somehow.\\nBut corruption, it’s endemic in government. You cannot stop corruption. Nobody can stop corruption unless you overturn the government completely. If I were the next president, if you think there’s really a need for you to change everybody in the system, then you declare martial law and fire everybody and allow the new generation to come in to work for the government.\\nEh kung hindi mo ganunin, walang mangyari. Nandiyan — it’s in the system eh. Kagaya ng drugs, sino ba namang maniwala na nine — nine generals sa pulis were into trafficking of drugs? And because they are — they are policemen, the charges simply just, you know, disappear there. Because the prosecution, the investigation which form part of the vital documents in court, wala eh. Nobody was investigating because they are also policemen.\\nKaya ‘yan kahirap ang ano. Kaya kung gusto mo itong mga ‘to, talagang… The only way to do it just call them and say, “Look for another job. Don’t — don’t…” Ganoon kahirap.\\nNow, let me pursue my talk with the foreign policy of the country. In the international arena, we have vigorously pursued an independent foreign policy centered on the promotion and protection of our core national interests. Yet… []\\nSigurado kayo sa pinakpakan ninyo? I was just laying the predicate of what I am going to say. Yet we conti — I will just give the cue then you clap your hands. [] If I… Yet we… Biro lang ‘yan ha.\\nYet we continue to work with all nations and seek partnerships that work. Because despite differences, it still is an interdependent world where interests and objectives intersect.\\nNow, partners – heretofore silent or equivocal – have expressed [key] principled positions that echo our own: that [in] disputes and contested areas, the majesty of the law must prevail. And this is most welcome. []\\nTo our friends in ASEAN and around the world: Thank you for supporting my Government, my country and people when it truly mattered. I assure you that the Philippines will remain a responsible member of the international community [] and we will work with you to achieve our shared objectives.\\nBut no mistake — but no mistake… But make no mistake rather, gone are the days when the Philippines decides and acts in the shadows of great powers. We will assert what is rightfully ours and fight for what is rightfully due to the Filipino people. []\\nWe do not have any SONA everyday. Now is as good as any other time to just let it out from sa puso mo.\\nThis is why we sent back container vans of garbage because our country is not a dumpsite. []\\nAnd the first country to do that, hindi ko alam kung bakit, ang Canada. And the container was there for three years because hindi alam ng port authorities kung anong gawain nila sa garbage. And I said, “Isauli mo. I want it done tomorrow. Those containers must be out of our country. ‘Pag hindi, kayong lahat, all of you in Customs, I’ll fire you.” That is a good ground for dismissing people for accepting the garbage. Kaya… May isa pa. Pero let me — let me end the story.\\nThe Balangiga. We welcomed back the bells of Balangiga after many decades because a historic wrong needed to be corrected. []\\nThe deal was I would say I am in bad faith. Sigurado ‘yan. I will admit it. But this is the real story. The Americans — former soldiers, war veterans went to see me — I think that was in Aguinaldo — and some military men. And in no uncertain terms, they said that, “You have been invited by Trump to go to America. Have you decided to go there?” I said, “No.” “Why?” Sabi ko, “I do not like the way that you are treating my country.” “Why?” I said, “For one…” And there was the clamor now of Balangiga. “You return the bells of Balangiga.” That’s a war really sacred also to the soldiers. Then it is more sacred to us in addition to the religion — the Roman Catholic Filipinos — the Church.\\nAng sabi nila, “Why don’t we make a deal?” Si Hogan, he’s an Ame — is he around? He’s a CIA agent. Sabi niya, “Isauli namin, pupunta ka?” Because I said earlier in my presidency, “There will never be a time that I will go to America.” Eh itong mga media mahilig mag-udyok eh. “Ah ganoon, bakit ka hindi pupunta? O arte mo lang ‘yan eh?” Sabi ko, “Then you watch me.” ‘Di gusto ninyong malaman. Sabi ko sa America, “Yes, I might consider going to America.”\\nSo well then, sabi ko, “Work on it.” In just two months’ time, they told me that the ship carrying the Balangiga bells are on their way to deliver it to Quezon. [] You removed it, you put it back there, kayo mismo.\\nSo tulong-tulong sila doon, nabalik na. And this Hogan said na, “Oh, so when are you going to go to America?” Sabi ko, “I do not have the time, but I will go there.” Noong malapit na, hindi na talaga ako pumunta. So… “Well, how about your promise?” Sabi ko, “Well, I lost time to do it. I cannot do it now.”\\nPero talaga, in my mind, and the Americans might know it, I was — there was never in my mind a trip to America. Iyong Balangiga, sabi ko, you massacred one barangay — barrio noon — women and children and all pinatay nila lahat because that bell, Balangiga, was used to call the people for prayers, ganoon. Sa simbahan ‘yun eh.\\nSo ‘yung ginawa nila, every time it is used, the Americans knew that it was — it has a great significance to the Filipinos, the Balangiga. After the massacre of one barangay, how many at the time, we would never know but it was, I said, isang barrio. Noon — barangay ngayon; barrio noon ‘yan eh. Barrio is an American word, the barrio. They also call the small places in Mexico barrio. The Americans borrowed it from the Spaniards, barrio.\\nSo sabi ko, the blood — you really got it at the expense of the blood of Filipinos. I… “Do not hurry me up. If I go to America, it will be in my own time.” Pero actually, wala ako. I have not been to America for almost 10 years, 20 — 22 years. I have not visited America and I do not have any intention of visiting it anymore.\\nWe called on the world to dismantle the heinous kafala system — ito ring isa — because the Filipino is no slave and to anyone anywhere [] and there is no room for modern day slavery. We helped start a new global civil rights movement for the migrant worker.\\nAnd, we asserted the arbitration ruling on the South China Sea — clearly and in no uncertain terms — bilaterally, [at] the ASEAN and finally, at the United Nations General Assembly. []\\nAnd let me talk about [what] I said in the September of last year: the Arbitral Award is now part of the international law and beyond compromise and beyond the reach of the passing governments to dilute, to diminish or abandon. []\\nThat is the problem. Let me now — just to everybody — everybody in the Middle East, I would like to tell them that not only Filipinos but all human beings, the kafala has no place there because it’s a setup for slavery. Either you correct it or we will ask our workers, Filipino workers, to go home.\\nSabi ko bahala na kung mahirap lang kami dito, okay lang. We will try our very best to make up for what they have lost, what they will lose in the process. But we will never allow them to be slaves.\\nBut we need to do more. With our partners, we continue scaling [up] our maritime domain awareness [and] defense capabilities. Yet, we will not close our doors on diplomacy and détente. Because that is how disputes are settled and never by force.\\nLet me… Alam mo, I respect the opinion. You should be aware by now of how I talk, especially on matters of — crucial matters that involved the country. Ito bang arbitral ruling, I’ve said it in — I think in the latter part of the speech — I said that what’s your problem in the arbitral ruling?\\nAmerica and some Filipinos — brilliant Filipinos, I would say — keep on pushing for something, which I really do not know. I have made a speech before the UN, naka-Zoom lang rin, nandito lang ako. Hindi ako pumunta doon. But in that speech, I laid down the bare, sabi ko — ng ating administrasyon.\\nAno pa ang gusto ninyo? What will I do with a document that [does] not bind China because they were never a part of that arbitration? There was really no arbitration at all because it was only the Philippine side was heard. Well and good.\\nBut ito ngayon that there is the arbitral ruling, you know, I do not want to insult these people pushing me for something more than what I can handle. At ano ang gusto nila, makipag-giyera? “Do something.” What do something? Do you want war against China? Well, I’ll tell you, even on the coast beach of Palawan, before you can take off, the missile of China would be there in about five or 10 minutes. It would be a massacre if I go and fight a war now. We are not yet a competent and able enemy of the other side.\\nSo what I did I was just being nice to them. But for some people to say that I was helped by China in being President, these idiots, really. I will never, never do that. Hindi na bale ako hindi ma-Presidente, hindi ko talaga gagawain ‘yan. To be what? Receiving money from China to buy votes? They say that they helped.\\nMaybe in some Chinese communities, the gossip going around was that “support Duterte.” But the whole of the Chinese community in the Philippines went for me. Why? Kasi sa Davao noong mayor ako, ni minsan hindi ako tumatanggap maski Christmas gift.\\nDito marami sa dito sa Maynila Presidente ako ngayon, maraming nagpapadala ng baril, kung anong ano diyan, sabi ko, “Isauli mo ‘yan”. Iyong mga relo. Eh itong aking relo, it’s IWC. This is only 300,000. But the Patek that has come [my] way, isinauli ko talaga. “Return it o ‘pag hindi, itapon mo sa Pasig sa harapan nila.”\\nHindi — hindi ako tinulungan ng China. Nag-usap kami ng China civilly but after election. And after election, I was a good friend of President Xi, until now.\\nWhen the pandemic struck, the first country I called for help was China. President Xi, sabi ko, “Mr. President, we have no vaccination program here because we do not have the vaccines. We have not been able to invent one. We might have a hard time.” He said, “no, it’s okay. We’ll send you.”\\nAnd he send us — donated about 1,500,000 of vaccines. Ganoon, kaya nga sabi ko ako, lalo na kaming mga Bisaya, mabigat sa amin ‘yan, for us Visayans, iyong utang na loob mabigat talaga ‘yan. Hindi mo mabayaran ng ano pero ‘pag may utang na loob ako sa iyo, you can be sure that I will be your friend, a true friend and die for you.\\nPero itong China magdayo, bakit ako magpakamatay diyan? Iyang sundalo ko ubusin ko? How can we fight China? Do we have the weapons? Do we have the — everything?\\nNow comes America, they say that if the attack is against the Philippines, they will defend. But they issued a statement that America does not meddle in conflicts involving the boundaries of other nations. And if America has to go to war, you would have to go to Congress to get — American Congress to get the authority to go to war.\\nThat is why many presidents hindi na lang — it was a — just a mere — an error, a mistake — a malicious mistake. No president has ever been punished for attacking nations, getting into a fight with nothing. And if they come here, well, ang problema kasi nandito na ‘yung Balangiga. Isauli na lang natin uli. Maybe I’ll just return it ‘pag ito’y… It’s no big deal to us. Iyan ang bells, ring it until you die.\\nFulfilling my promise to our coconut farmers and the Filipino people, my administration has worked with Congress to pass the Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act. [] We have returned also the Coco Levy funds to its true and rightful owners — our coconut farmers. [] The fund is now worth an estimated to be 75 billion [pesos], which will be utilized according to the plans and programs in the Coconut Farmers and Industry Development Plan for the direct benefit of the coconut farmers and the development of the coconut industry.\\nIn our effort to ensure that food is within reach of every Filipino family, we worked for the passage of the Rice Tariffication Law in 2019 despite pushbacks. This resulted in the stabilization of rice supply and food prices. The proceeds from the tariffs enabled us to provide our farmers with modern machineries that increased their yield and sustaining the growth in agricultural production.\\nWe also fulfilled our promise to [provide] free irrigation. That was the first promise I made some — in San Miguel, Bulacan when I was campaigning. The farmers invited me to go into the farms inside San Miguel, Bulacan. And we had a sort of a — well, a meeting, and the first thing that they were complaining about was the severity of the irrigation that they have to pay 5,000 every month — ah every year. Si sabi ko, “I will work on it.” Free Irrigation Service Act of 2018 is a product that now lowers the cost of agricultural production, especially for poor farmers.\\nWe also worked to ensure that households have adequate supply of clean water. Potable and affordable water is more than a commodity. It is a vital public good. This is why I used my political capital to fight vested interests behind disadvantageous water service contracts [] that burdened consumers with unjustified water price increases. With the signing of [Revised Concession Agreements] with water concessionaires, consumers will be protected at least until 2037.\\nGanito ‘yan eh, there is this concessionaire, dalawa. Ayaw ko na lang mag-ano — I will not mention names pero this is really what happened. Ang dalawang concessionaires, one in the south and the one is north, as the rich cartel dito sa Southeast Asia, ang kina-capture nila ang electricity pati tubig.\\nDito sa tubig, in this contract with the water concessionaires, we made so many concessions that really, sabi ko, if you look at the contract and look at the Anti-Graft Law, talagang it’s all anti-graft. All of the sentences even the period and the question marks there.\\nAh bakit? Sila walang problema sa tax because the people, consumers, will pay the taxes for them. Sila kung malugi, sabi nila hindi nila kasalanan and we can — I can think of it through not of their own fault, sabi doon bayaran natin sila malugi. We pay for the tax corporation nila at sila ang mag-decide kung i-increase nila o i-decrease nila ang water prices.\\nThe regulators, itong mga regulators sa Pilipinas walang magawa and they acceded to the contract. It was really — I do not know how to put it. Kaya ako nag-pardon, ‘di ba nagmura ako? Sabi ko, biro mo kung malugi sila, babayaran pa natin. Tayo ang — ang corporate tax nila, tayo ang magbayad. And it’s a cartel, that service concessionaires are part of the cartel of Malaysia and Indonesia, and they form part of that mother corporation. Itong mga sa Pilipinas pati sa Malaysia, Indonesia they are just — kumbaga sa istorya, chapter lang ‘yan sila. It’s being controlled up by the…\\nKaya sabi ko, “Wala ito.” I told them — I told Dominguez, “Tell them that I am no longer honoring the contract.” Mayroon pa doon payment of itong tax — water treatment plant to be constructed in the Harrison Plaza site. Iyon ang pinirmahan natin. So 1997 up to the present or up to the month that I blew my top, nagbabayad — ewan ko kung ngayon nagbabayad na. There’s a kuwan there sa water bills ninyo for enhancement of quality water. Ang ibig sabihin water treatment. And they were collecting since 1997 so until now how much of the Filipino’s money are with them for nothing, not even for a song?\\nKaya ako, if there is something — hindi naman proud — but if there is something someday that my children will say: “What have you done for my country?” Sabihin ko, sila. Talagang inupakan ko sila. Sabi ko… []\\nAyaw ninyo? You do not want it? Well, okay, I will — I will just confiscate your system and call the military to operate it. I will exercise the eminent domain and expropriate all of your assets here kasi gagawin ko.\\nIyon ang nangyari sa… So sinabi ko sa military, in one of our meetings immediately after that incident, I said, “If I do not make it to the finish line, kindly — look kindly at the Filipino at tanungin ninyo kung ano na ang nangyari sa kanila, iyang tubig na yan.”\\nNow, there is a new contract. I have not yet — I have to thoroughly digest it inside. I have to absorb it every word of it that the Filipino is protected. ‘Pag nandiyan na ‘yan, then I will sign. But I will not forget, I’m telling them the crime is there already and any Filipino who would want to go after you, can. Sabi ko, “I will not free you, I will not — there’s no way we’re —- in your… I will never allow that. Just make a new contract, just realize everyday that I can call you.”\\nItong frequency, frequency ng ABS-CBN. Iyan ang pinaka-ideal kasi, you know, frequency is everywhere. But there is a spot, kung sa golf, a soft spot na maganda ‘yung… Wala akong problema sa ABS-CBN. They got my money, I’m not… They wanted to return it when the case blew up at they printed all the garbage including my daughter as a drug trafficker. Nilamon ko na lang lahat ‘yun because I never wanted to be — to appear vindictive.\\nBut itong ano… They are cheating government by the billions in taxes. And they still want that frequency because ‘yan ang pinapag-awayan. No. I will give it to a Filipino na gustong maggawa nang tamang ano and pay. Because sa ABS-CBN, ‘yung even their equipment were imported tax-free kaya talaga ako hindi magpapayag. They still owe government billions. In the contract diyan sa nakalagay doon four hectares. So ang binabayaran nila four hectares sa property taxes. Supposed they are occupying 40 hectares, that complex there. Pero ginamit nila na papel ‘yung four hectares. Iyon lang ang binabayaran nila. Kung hindi ba naman… Kaya ko sila inaway. And, well…\\nOur micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs constitute 99.6 percent of our country’s businesses and are vital to economic activity, job creation, and poverty reduction. Ipinaramdam natin ang ating malasakit sa maliliit na negosyante sa pamamagitan ng Pondo sa Pagbabago at Pag-asenso Program. Since 2017, mayroon na tayo niyan. We have the program. The program has provided over 219,000 underprivileged microentrepreneurs with an alternative to the exploitative lending 5-6.\\nIyan ang naka ano sa… You know what, maybe I have to go to — if need be, I have to go to India. Iyong 5-6 nila ng Turko, tinatawag nilang Turko, kung maghiram ka sa kanila ng 10,000, pahiramin ka niyang hindi pera 10,000. Six, seven thousand lang. And the others, mga refrigerator or the things that you do not even need in the house, bilhin mo sa kanila. Sala set, lahat na. That is part of… You do not want the furniture, the refrigerators, they won’t give you the…\\nKaya ang Pilipino nabuktot. Alam mo ang buktot? Naging hunchback na lang sa trabaho, ganoon pa man. Kaya ako, sasabihin ko itong mga Turko, you better come up with a fair scheme if you want to go into business sa money lending, but not at that usu — usury a thousand times.\\nLikewise, to further support development of our micro and small businesses, we [instituted] radical reforms in the tax system to ease the taxation burden and increase the net income of lower wage earners and small businesses.\\nThanks to Congress… [] Iyan hindi pa ninyo alam ha. Sabi ko lang…\\nThanks to Congress and our revenue generating agencies, our tax reforms sustained our economic growth from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2019, which made the Philippines one of the fastest growing economies in Asia until the [] pandemic scourge.\\nIyon talaga ang… Well, I don’t know what’s the plan of God. He sent us something which hit us right in the heart. We see so many — there’s no way of telling when this virus would disappear from the planet of the Earth. We can only pray to God to look into our direction and decide on what will happen to this planet he created.\\nHowever, tax laws are not always perfect and that is why every now and then, they have to be revisited to see if they are at pace with the changing times. Let us therefore continue to monitor the relevance and impact of our tax laws on individuals and private institutions to prevent serious damage on their financial health.\\nGoing now to the social and health issues.\\nTo unburden our people of the hefty costs of tertiary education, my administration worked with Congress to pass a landmark legislation that had remained unpassed for so many years: the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act in 2017 which provides free education to college students in state universities. [] Thank you, Congress.\\nWe also passed the Universal Health Care Act in 2019. And to supplement this, I also signed into law the Malasakit Centers Act in 2019. []\\nKasi ganito ‘yan eh, ‘pag ang pobreng Pilipino nasa ospital, magpunta pa siya doon sa kung saan makahingi ng tulong. So ang ginawa, just like in Davao, ginawa namin ‘yung lahat na kailangan, ‘yung Internal Revenue kung nandiyan, business permit, diyan na lang sa isang lugar, medisina, kunin nila. Diyan mismo sa ospital, hindi na sila maglakad-lakad. And to me, that is one of the most — let me find the word — a poignant act of Congress and of the executive department. []\\n[This] legislation, which was sponsored by Senator Bong Go [] — if you feel like standing up, you can, Senator, [] mas sikat ka pa sa guest speaker — [has] unburdened our people of the tedious process of going to various agencies and offices in order to avail of assistance from government. I am pleased to report that we have already established 130 Malasakit Centers across the country [] that has already helped millions of Filipinos in their hospitalization needs.\\nBy establishing Malasakit Centers all over the country, we have actually levelled the playing field and provided our less fortunate countrymen the medical care they deserve. We will be establishing more. God willing, if we are still around.\\nSa pagtatag ng Malasakit Center, hindi na po kailangan lumapit at humingi ng tulong sa iba’t ibang ahensya ng gobyerno. Ang gobyerno na ang lumalapit sa tao. []\\nSo let us talk about COVID. It’s mentioned everywhere in the speech, but what — what’s this g**d*** virus is?\\nI have to admit: back when I decided to answer your call and run for higher office, never, never did I imagine that my presidency would not only be judged by how I made good on my campaign promises in fighting illegal drugs, criminality, and corruption but by how well I led our nation dumake — during rather, the global pandemic.\\nHindi na ako maka-pronounce mabuti baka mayroon na ako. [ and ] May ambulansya ba diyan? Mukhang iba na ang… You know, I cannot pronounce the words. I hope this is not asymptomatic. []\\nPrior to the pandemic, we recorded our lowest debt-to-GDP ratio since 1986, the highest revenue effort since 1997, the highest credit rating in the country’s history — ‘yung sa bangko — because if your rating is high, it’s easy to borrow at maliit lang ang interest, that is the dynamics of a rating by Fitch — Fitch and [Standard] &amp; Poor’s, mga ganoon — and the lowest rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty, well it’s still there. It is beyond dispute that our economic and governance fundamentals were robust when COVID-19 hit us.\\nI am sure that much can be said about the way we took on the daunting challenge of preserving lives while sustaining our momentum towards [our] developmental — dito na lang ako — goals. Naturally, we prioritized saving lives. Buhay muna bago ang lahat. Ibig sabihin, inuna natin ‘yung gastos — ‘yung pera natin sa pandemic. Kinuha ng — lahat ng anong mga budget. Si Dominguez ‘yan. Iyon ang ginamit ninyo sa Bayanihan 1 and 2. Doon natin kinuha ‘yung pera.\\nWe moved quickly to safeguard the well-being of every Filipino through preventive and responsive health and safety measures, and broad and inclusive social amelioration programs or SAP. Thanks to the support of Congress, we launched the most extensive Social Protection Program in our country’s history, with the passage of Bayanihan 1 and Bayanihan 2. []\\nIndeed, our national health system and resilience were tested to the hilt. Countless lessons were learned and continuous improvements put in place. Kahit anong krisis ay kayang malampasan, kung tunay na may malasakit at bayanihan. I agree.\\nAt the early stages of the pandemic, our testing capacity was very limited. Recognizing the importance of conducting more tests to ensure early detection and timely isolation of confirmed COVID-19 cases, we ramped up our testing capacity. We now have more than 260 accredited laboratories nationwide which is capable of conducting at least 50,000 tests daily. All regions now can conduct their own COVID-19 tests.\\nTo take care of mild and asymptomatic cases, we established over 9,000 temporary treatment and monitoring facilities across the country, with a total bed capacity of more than 140,000. Together with local governments and the private sector, we quickly established mega quarantine facilities that could accommodate more cases. Modular hospitals and quarantine facilities have also been established nationwide, especially in Metro Manila.\\nFor our severe COVID cases, our tireless healthcare workers ensure that you are provided with the best care round the clock, based on latest developments and global best practices. Our health experts continue to actively participate in the search for safe and effective COVID-19 medicines.\\nWith the help of Congress… Kita mo sa lahat. I never said, wala kang makikita, “that, I, [garbled] the key construction of a bridge that is nowhere to be found today,” iyong mga ganoon. Ako, sa inyo talaga.\\nWith the help of Congress, we passed 13 measures that established new and improved the capacity of existing hospitals around the country to provide quality care and services to our people, especially amid the ongoing [COVID-19 pandemic]. []\\nThese include establishing new medical facilities in Mandaluyong City, Bacolod and Davao Occidental; increasing bed capacities of existing health facilities in Quezon City, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Palawan; [and] upgrading health facilities in that area to include Leyte.\\nCurrently, we have received over 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. We expect [to receive at least] 36 million vaccines this month and in August. We have inoculated more than [17] million Filipinos [] — [around 11 million] of which have received their first dose. At least 17 million.\\nWell, I think the landscape — the health landscape of the country continues to improve as we, you know…\\nWith the continuous [arrival] of COVID-19 vaccines, we are ready to boost further our daily vaccination rate. I am also encouraging our local government units to hasten their roll out and strengthen their inoculation program. San Juan City, for one, [will] have vaccinated 70 percent of their population in a month’s time. Saludo ako sa inyo [] at kay Mayor Zamora.\\nWe cannot continue living in the shadow of this potent enemy, especially now that science and medicine has proven that it is possible to live with — if not entirely defeat — this virus. The health and safety protocols we put in place have proven effective in slowing the spread of the virus. But the best solution is still vaccination.\\nAm I too… Mataas na ba? Kasi kung mataas na, putulin na lang ninyo itong gumagalaw dito para sabihin ko, eh wala na man akong mabasa. ‘Pag matagal na… Those who want to go home, you raise your right hands. [ and ] Pati si Monsignor baka itaas niya ang kamay niya eh. []\\nThat is why I implore our countrymen who are now in the list of sectors to be inoculated to get vaccinated now. To those who received their first doses, please return for your second shot.\\nI also ask for patience to those who are next in line to receive their vaccine. More and more COVID-19 vaccines are arriving each week and you will soon have your turn.\\nCorollary to this, it is high time that clear, precise and uniform protocols and guidelines are issued in anticipation of the vaccination of more Filipinos and the steady reopening of our society.\\nYou know, pagpasensyahan ninyo ako. I… I ask… I beg your kind indulgence. But I have to say this — to talk about something which would affect us all. Iyang… It seems that this government is too far away from the people. Iyong serbisyo talaga na totoo.\\nNoong isang araw, nakita ko, I don’t know what place was that. Ang mga tao nakapila and they say that they were there at 4 o’clock, lumalakas ‘yung ulan, sa payong lang sila. So nanonood ako sa report because I listen to the report every morning. Makukuha mo sa mga radio station ‘yan eh. So I was having breakfast. I was listening to the TV, at nakita ko ‘yung mga tao nakapila, lumalakas ang ulan. Sabi ko, “P***…” Eh doon sa breakfast table, nagmura ako. Pero dito good boy man ako kay may mga religious diyan baka…\\nI thus call on the National Task Force Against COVID-19 to see to it that this happens — I mean the protection. We have spent enormous amounts of resources to build our capacities to overcome this pandemic. We cannot afford more lockdowns lest our economy bleeds to the point of irreversible damage.\\nBalikan ko ‘yung ano, bakit mo papilahin? At sabi kasi doon libre lahat na, wala ng ano. So nagpuntahan ‘yung mga tao na nagpila kasi wala nang lista-lista pero sabi ng mga ito, alas kwatro pa sila. T*** i**.\\nHindi lang ako puwedeng mag… Alam mo sa totoo lang, hindi naman ako nagyayabang. I am just an ordinary Filipino citizen. Just like you, I get hurt when people are nearly almost brutalized. Bakit hindi ka magkuha?\\nIt’s rain time. Malakas ang monsoon — southwest monsoon. Dumadaan talaga sa Pilipinas. Gamitin mo ang utak mo. You should look for a gym at bigyan mo lahat ng tao ng number. Hanggang dito lang for this… Hanggang dito lang tayo, balik kayo itong bukas from 15 to 20, kayo na naman bukas.\\nBigyan mo ng card. Prepare a card where you can — the marshal will go around the queuing na… Bakit mo…? Hindi ko maintindihan — there’s media — hindi ko maintindihan bakit gawain mo ‘yan sa Pilipino? Iyan ang tinatanong ko. Why do you have to do it to the Filipino? You can always — you know, maghanap ka ng… Tsk.\\nThere is always a gymnasium. Mga eskwelahan walang klase ngayon. Bakit hindi mo gamitin doon? Bakit ka maghanap ng isang room…? T******** na… Kaya lang ako… Well, it is my — to my chagrin because I’m… Gusto kong lumabas. Itong PSG lang na ito ang…\\nYou know, sabihin ko sa inyo, huwag kayong mag-presidente kay wala talagang… Sabihin ko maliit ang suweldo, wala ka. If you are not there really for the — mag-corrupt ka diyan, well, it would make you a billionaire overnight. But kung magtrabaho ka lang ng ganito…\\nAko Presidente, gusto kong lumabas doon, sabihin ko, “Hoy, mga p***** i** ninyo, bakit ganito ‘to? Bakit ganoon kayo ka-estupido?” I mean, the Filipino does not deserve it even if they are not paying taxes. Because the theory of government is that all money belongs to the people and the money is there, it belongs to all of us and it should be used for public good. But what — what is the use of public good if you are not good and stupid? So ganoon ang mangyayari sa Pilipino.\\nI’m just letting off my… Kasi kung hindi lang talaga bawal, eh itong PSG hindi ako pinapalabas. Magsabi ako magpunta ako doon, “Sir, hindi puwede ‘yan, hindi puwede.” Kulong talaga ako. Mag-presidente ka, sa totoo lang you are a prisoner. You are brought here, kunwari ka pa de-chopper ka, de-guwardiya, tapos uwi ka doon sa bahay mo, tapos hindi ka na makalabas. Preso ka talaga.\\n“Tawagin mo ‘yung security, ‘yung gusto kong pumunta…” “Sir, hindi. Pasensya na.” Tapos pagalitan mo, sabihin, “Sir, eh ang authority namin does not come from you, it comes from a law so kami ang masunod.” Talagang… Sige ka pirma a bunch of papers. If you read it hanggang umaga trabaho ka. Suweldo mo ganoon lang. Just give me 219,000 tapos ganoon ang trabaho mag-isa ka. Buti’t ngayon kay nandito ‘yung asawa ko, nandito ‘yung anak ko. Nabubuhay ‘yung loob ko mag-uwi ako sa bahay ngayon. Tsk.\\nLooking forward, today is my last State of the Nation Address, but this is by no means my swan song. I shall never cease to implore Congress to pass vital and critical legislation as well as push the entire government to ensure nothing less than the full recovery and revitalization of our country.\\nBut to do this, it is necessary for us to first overcome the crippling fear, anxiety and uncertainty that caused — that was caused by the threat of the COVID-19 virus.\\nWell, I really do not know what to do. I have to listen to the Task Force. This is a group of people volunteering to be a collective advisor that would give you the advice collectively, we put it that way, na sila ang mag-ano, magsabi. And we’re just waiting for the word.\\nI am referring to COVID D, Delta. It is rampaging now in Indonesia, Thailand, India, and many parts of Asia. And ang sabi doon sa — the Western medicine says that it is far more aggressive and far more dangerous and it can cause death easily than the COVID-19 original.\\nSo this is as good as any other time to say it, if sees that it is really dangerous, you have to go back to lockdown. If there are many people in other parts of the world killing as many, then Delta, if ever it will spread — we have it here now — I hope it will not go any further. But if something wrong happens, I’ll have to be strict and I have now my word that there will be a… Just like what happened in the early days. Eh kung ganoon ang COVID D, saan tayo pupunta?\\nAnd if there is — it requires a new vaccine, we do not have it yet, I do not know what… Maybe we will just have to pray for salvation. Sabihin natin, “Diyos, we have done everything. But you know, this time we are really put hard on these things that happened.”\\nRest assured that we will exert every effort to restore the lost livelihood of our affected countrymen. I have recently signed an Executive Order creating the task force that will shepherd the country’s National Employment Recovery Strategy.\\nThe Task Force recently partnered with the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines to implement the Reform, Rebound, and Recover Program that aims to vaccinate qualified workers to fill in more than one million jobs.\\nThese jobs will be created by different business associations in the fields of construction, information technology, BPO, and electronics. To our business associations, thank you for joining in our effort to bring back lost income opportunities for our workforce.\\nAnother important component of our employment recovery strategy is the retooling of our workers to prepare them for better job opportunities. Since the start of community quarantines, over [1.2] million [individuals] availed of the TESDA’s free online training programs.\\nI am directing the National Employment Recovery Strategy Task Force, particularly TESDA, to ensure the upskilling of our workers and increase their employability. I expect the task force to work double time not only to recoup job losses, but more importantly to rehabilitate the economy and help our hardest hit sectors [recover].\\nThrough the COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program, we released 988 million pesos worth of loans to over 14,000 enterprises [under] Bayanihan 1. [Under] Bayanihan 2, we released 2.9 billion pesos worth of loans to over 12,000 enterprises including our displaced OFWs and enterprises in the tourism sector to help them start or sustain their businesses amid the pandemic.\\nAlong this line, I would like to renew my call to Congress to immediately pass the amendments of priority legislative measures such as the Foreign Investments Act, the Public Service Act, and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act. []\\nYour  went well ahead of its realization. You have to work on this guys and well I am sure that we can have a respite of this contagion in a — in your own little way.\\nFinally, I would like to reiterate my call for Congress again to pass legislation to establish a single agency that shall focus on and respond quickly to the needs and concerns of our OFWs. I pray that our next leaders and our future generations will not squander our natural resources and fight for the integrity of our environment, in a manner fiercer and more effective than my administration had ever done.\\nThe pandemic has taken so much from us as a nation but like [all] other adversities that tested us time and again, it can never take [away] our courage and resilience. And the spirit of Bayanihan 1 — rather, bayanihan and the value of malasakit are now indelible in us Filipinos. We shall use these gifts to forge ahead towards a better normal.\\nAs we come to a point where the risk of COVID-19 transmission can, to a certain extent, be managed, I am hopeful that we shall be united in forging ahead towards bringing the country back to its robust growth path.\\nLet me end by adding these particular statements. Well, on learning — education and learning.\\nDespite our inability to conduct face-to-face classes during this pandemic, we remain determined to deliver quality and accessible education to all. The creation of the Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan enabled the uninterrupted learning of students in the basic education sector while ensuring their and teachers’ health, safety, and well-being.\\nWhile the pandemic has demonstrated the readiness, resourcefulness and capability of government to serve the Filipino people through the use of ICT and digital services, it has also shown its inherent deficiencies and weaknesses. As such I ask Congress to pass an E-Governance Act that will set up the transition of government processes to the digital age.\\nI would like to add something on the protection of our overseas Filipinos.\\nI also ask Congress to pass a law creating the Department of Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos [] — kailangan po ito because they are suffering not on — they suffered not only yesterday but they are still suffering now with so many inadequacies, in both our government response including the monetary assistance — to ensure that there is a department that is solely focused on addressing the needs and taking care of the welfare of our countrymen abroad.\\nBefore I end, let me also touch on the environmental protection.\\nIt has also been 13 years since the Supreme Court, through a mandamus, ordered the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. Unfortunately, no immediate substantial action to comply with the Supreme Court’s order was undertaken until 2019, when this administration started its long overdue rehabilitation.\\nAs of May [2021], all illegally operating open dumpsites surrounding Manila Bay have been shut down, while 151 out of 187 LGUs surrounding the Bay now have access to sanitary landfills.\\nEstablishments have been forced to comply with environmental laws and ordinances while those who did not have been closed down.\\nAs a result, pollutants have been largely reduced and coliform levels — also reduced to its barest maximum — are now on its lowest levels in years if not decades. I urge the DENR to sustain its efforts and continue working with our LGUs to restore Manila Bay to its former glory. []\\nYou know, just one little thing before we end. Iyong pag-ano sa Manila Bay, well, there is a corner where all the garbage con — by current — by action of the current, nandito marami sa likod ng Luneta.\\nGinawa natin ‘yan at nilagay natin itong ‘yung puting bato na which is, well, scattered into small pieces. Eh nawawala minsan ‘yan because of the waves.\\nSo every now and then, we still have to replenish because we cannot change the nature of our shores. That is how it is. It is not a permanent fixture there, [dolomite]. It is there from the mountains and we break it down and bring it to the sea.\\nBut that would occupy that place irrespective of there is a high tide or low tide. Nakakatulong ‘yan at nawawala ‘yan. And the only way to do it is to replenish it until we can think of a good alternative of how we can process the whole thing back to its normalcy. If there was really normalcy at the time or at any other time in the past.\\nOn the resilience. Again, dinagdag ko na lang ito. Time is good and as any other time again to ask you.\\nIn line with this, we hope to pursue the creation of public entities dedicated to managing emerging and re-emerging diseases. I thus fervently ask Congress to enact a law creating the Center for Disease Prevention and Control and the Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines.\\nWe must… [] Maski gaano natin kahirap, however poor we are I think that the Filipinos, given the proper support and the things there, the equipment that they have to use, we can — I am sure that the Filipino brain can also process or make vaccines in the future. []\\nTapos na po ‘yan, ma’am. I ask Congress to pass the — ‘yan — Disaster Resilience Act that will create the Department of Disaster Resilience.\\nLet us also — pagkatapos nito, ma’am, ikaw ‘yung unang tao na mag-congratulate sa akin ha. Kaya ako nagka-utal-utal dito eh dahil sa iyo.\\nLet us also pass the law implementing the Fire Protection Modernization Program to bolster the readiness of our firefighters and ensure their ability to respond to fires and disasters. Related to this… [] Importante ‘yang trabaho ng bumbero maniwala kayo. They must also be there during any disaster happening.\\nLet us also push for the Mandatory Establishment of Evacuation Centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country, which shall provide the basic needs and assistance to all evacuees during times of emergency.\\nNow, there is now the conclusion. Sabi, “Hay, salamat.” [] Sabi, ” P*****g Duterte ‘to oh.”\\nThe lights go out for this administration eleven months from now. The work that we started and expected to finish within the constitutional time frame of six years has been stalled. Much was hoped for. But we need not despair. Desperation is a feeling alien to the resilient Filipino.\\nA peaceful and prosperous Philippines is no longer a distant dream but one that is within our grasp if our future Filipinos would also do it — if would continue the — if they would continue and would seize the opportunity to work together.\\nMalaki ang pasasalamat ng mga kababayan natin at lagi nilang sinasabi na mas panatag ang loob nila ngayon. Hindi na nababahala ang mga magulang na lumalabas ang mga anak nila at naglalakad sa gabi. []\\nI will not elaborate on anything. You can draw your conclusion. Alam mo, when the Filipino, a father, a mother, or a child, naglalakad sa gabi at siya ay — kagaya ng iba, even in America, you go into the inner cities of L.A. and New York, you — sa Washington D.C., there’s a corner there, there’s a — do not go there because you will not come out alive. Ganoon, kung hindi maglakad na sila puro takot na lang ang nasa loob nila ma-holdup sa jeep tapos pati ‘yung taga Ombudsman na buntis patay pa pati ‘yung bata sa loob ng tiyan.\\nJust to get the money to buy shabu because when the monkey is riding on your back, iyong katawan mo hindi mo na maano, that is why you need to higop — sip, kailangan mo maghigop at kailangan mo pumatay ‘pag wala kang pera. Hindi naman talagang papatay, maybe not. The mind is not ready for that but in the struggle, you put up a struggle if you are the owner of the money, eh talagang papatayin ka ‘pag hindi mo ibigay.\\nIyan ang ayaw ko kaya noong na-mayor ako sa Davao, ganito, mga p***** i** — mga p****** i** niyo, umalis kayo sa daan, ‘yung daan, ‘yung public transportation is for public good. Huwag mo silang takutin na magkanto ‘pag uwi, nandiyan nag-iinuman sa — iyan ang hilig ng Pilipinong — mag-inuman. Hindi mo malaman ang mga nag-uwi na babae, they have to take another route that would be longer because nandiyan mga istambay.\\nSo the streets are unsafe, hino-holdup, pinapatay. Sabi ko doon sa Davao — sa Davao na lang, huwag na lang ako dito sa Maynila, hindi naman talaga ako nakikialam dito pero alam nila, alam ng pulis kung ano ang gusto ko.\\nMag-prangkahan tayo. Sabi ko sa pulis, “Isauli mo ‘yan.” The roads, the highways are for law-abiding citizens of this country. Iyong mga kriminal, ‘yung mga — well, the dregs of society, huwag ninyong gamitin ‘yang mga daan, hindi para sa inyo ‘yan. And I will see to it that you are not there, be sure that when I pass by, I do not see you. Because if I see you, I will dance with you. Isauli ko.\\nKaya ngayon medyo hindi naman talaga ano but ‘yung mga sales girl ng mga — mga shopping center eh panatag na ang loob nila at least ang chances of being mugged, murdered, and raped. Iyan ang ayaw ko. ‘Pag malayo nakahigop na, kunin ‘yung pera, hilain doon sa medyo maliit na mga grassy portion and rape at papatayin. Iyan ang hindi ko matanggap. Just like ‘yang Pilipino sabi ko…\\nI may be — I may be just a little bit crazier than the others but that is what I am. Ayaw ko ‘yung — lalo na mag — mag-shabu ka tapos mag-pasyal ka kung ano wala kang makuhang pera, aakyat ka ng bahay. Just like that bank teller, it was raining so hard just like the rains that we had experienced. It was pouring almost cats and [dogs], ang lakas talaga nang bagsak ng ulan. She went home to knock the door and pump the door loud but ang parents nilang matanda — matanda na ‘yung parents, hindi nakarinig.\\nSo anong ginawa nitong ma — mga sa construction workers? Sabi ko diyan nga ako galit sa droga eh. Nabibili nila mura. It’s 200, 300, susuyupin nila at ‘pag nakasuyop ng droga ‘yan, maghanap ng alcohol ‘yan. Sigurado ‘yan. ‘Pag tama ng alcohol pati ‘yung ano ng droga it shrinks the brain, ‘yon. Iyong babae dinampot — she was just picked up and brought to the construction site near the house tapos ni-rape doon, pinatay, sinunog pa.\\nIyan ang hindi ko talaga maintindihan. I cannot reco… Iyong bata na 3-year-old rape-in mo. Ang problema nito, ang nakikita nila ang patay na mga kriminal. Well, how about the victims on the other side? Bakit hindi ninyo tingnan and see what these criminals have done to our children, to our wives, and daughters?\\nMay listahan kayo p**… Ang listahan ninyo doon sa namatay hindi ba kayo maligaya niyan wala ng kriminal? Pero ‘pag tingin mo dito ilan ang patay na inosente? Pati pulis ko at sundalo namamatay diyan baka akala ninyo kriminal lang. So that is my lamentations and I just want you to hear.\\nIn my five years in office, we made real change in governance through the reforms we pursued. However, for this governance — must be sustained and broadened. We need to make…\\nI’m not — I’m just getting my air. Naghihingal ako. Baka — baka dito ako mamatay pagka-Presidente. Iba na ang pitik ng ano ko ngayon ng kasing-kasing ko. Kasing-kasing is puso.\\n[We need] to make every public servant responsive to the needs of the people and enjoin every Filipino to assert their right to demand malasakit from their leaders until everyone lives with dignity — well-fed, educated, healthy, secure, disciplined, and empowered — to contribute to national development.\\nI will not be forever be President. But ang kulang sa Pilipino is assertiveness. ‘Pag may — mayroon kayong transaction at hingian kayo, ang sabi ko sa inyo, ito ang payo ko, murahin mo, sabihin mo, “P***** i** ka, nagtatrabaho kayo at kami dito. We are following papers and you are sitting on your a** on it.”\\nKaya dito, sabi ko, makinig kayong lahat ng Pilipino tutal last SONA ko na ito, ‘pag may mag-follow up kayo, permit, clearance, at maghingi ng pera, murahin ninyo. Sabihin ninyo, “’Yan, sabi ni Duterte sampalin ko kayo kasi ako nagbabayad ng buwis, bakit ginaganito ninyo?”\\nAnd to the mga Pilipino, hindi naman lahat, tayong nagtatrabaho sa gobyerno, I mean it takes you one month to process a paper, it takes you — tapos pabalik-balik ‘yung tao. ‘Pag ang tao bumabalik, dalawa, isa, tatlo, then there is corruption there. Murahin mo, at kung maaari, pahiramin kita ng pangkulam para kulamin mo.\\nGanoon talaga. I’m just warning everybody, there’s still one year to go. In Davao, three days. Lagyan mo ng papel, “Bumalik ka dito at this hour on Thursday.” At pagka naipakita mo ‘yung papel, hanapin niyo ‘yung ibibigay. Iyan ang gamitin ninyo, for all the local governments also.\\nIn my Cabinet, it’s 30 days, walang extension. All. Sabi ko, you reduce the signing authority from six, seven, to only one or two. Hindi naman pala kailangan… [] Hindi kailangan magpirma lahat ng empleyado diyan, one or two. Iyong iba mag-process lang.\\nBut if you cannot process it also in so many days, in Davao, if you sub — if it is a clearance, which is long overdue, hindi mo na puwedeng ibigay doon sa tao. Ibigay mo sa akin at tanungin kita, “… mo, bakit inabot ka ng ganito?” Wala — there is no other conclusion. Corruption ‘yan.\\nKagaya… What is true in Davao is true for the entire Philippines. Mabuti’t na rin ‘yan nakapagsalita ako ng freely with you tutal last ko naman na itong SONA. Mabuti ‘yang malaman ng tao na ganoon ang ginagawa nila. It’s not there. Hindi man — hindi man nila lalagay ‘yang mga ganoon na, wala mang mura diyan. Be careful this is…\\nWe need to fight to subdue narrow vested interests and ensure that our gains will [redound] to the benefit of the greater number of Filipinos, especially those who have the least in life.\\nWe have laid down the groundwork and are continuing to push for landmark reforms and key accomplishments up to the last days of my term. I have full confidence that the Filipino spirit…\\nPati ako nagmamadali na. Eh naiihi na kanina pa eh. [ and ] It’s a natural human biology so what’s the big deal? Bakit kayo magpakpak kung napaihi na ako? [ and ] Sabagay, alam ko rin, nahihiya kayong magtindig. Puno ang pila nito pagdating sa CR mamaya. []\\nI have full confidence that the Filipino spirit will persevere and triumph. Together, let us rise as a nation. Thank you. []\\n— END —\\n</td>\n",

MARCOS JR.\\nPRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES\\nTO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES\\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 25, 2022]\\n \\nVice President Sara Zimmerman Duterte; Former Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Rodrigo Roa Duterte; Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the honorable Justices of the Supreme Court; the Apostolic Nuncio Most Reverend Charles John Brown and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; the honorable members of the Cabinet; our First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos and our children []; distinguished guests; ang mga minamahal kong mga kababayan; ladies and gentlemen; magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat.\\nI come before you today to address you, as it is my duty as President of the Republic.\\nWe live in difficult times brought about by some forces of our own making, but certainly, also by forces that are beyond our control.\\nBut we have, and we will continue to find solutions.\\nAnd these are some of them.\\nIn terms of the economy, we will implement a sound fiscal management.\\nTax administration reforms will be in place to increase revenue collection.\\nExpenditure priorities will be realigned, and spending efficiency will be improved to immediately address the economic scarring arising from the effects of COVID-19, and also to prepare for future shocks.\\nProductivity-enhancing investments will be promoted.\\nOur country must become an investment destination, capitalizing on the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Law and the economic liberalization laws such as the Public Service Act and the Foreign Investments Act.\\nEcozones will be fully supported to bring in strategic industries such as those engaged in high-tech manufacturing, health and medical care, and all emerging technologies.\\nThis is also seen to facilitate economic growth outside of Metro Manila.\\nOur tax system will be adjusted in order to catch up with the rapid developments of the digital economy, including the imposition of value-added tax on digital service providers.\\nThe initial revenue impact will be around Php 11.7 billion in 2023 alone.\\nTax compliance procedures will be simplified to promote ease of paying taxes.\\nWe will pursue measures to determine possible undervaluation and/or trade misinvoicing of imported goods.\\nThrough information and communications technology, the Bureau of Customs will promote streamlined processes.\\nDisbursements for 2022 to 2023 will be maintained at above 20 percent of gross domestic product or Php 4.955 trillion and Php 5.086 trillion, respectively, to ensure continuous implementation of priority programs.\\nDisbursement will further increase over the medium-term from Php 5.402 trillion or 20.7 percent of our GDP in 2024 to Php 7.712 trillion or 20.6 percent of GDP in 2028.\\nThe Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy of this administration seeks to attain short-term macro-fiscal stability while remaining supportive of the country’s economic recovery and to promote medium-term fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, and more importantly, fiscal policy aims to bring together the National Government’s resources so that these are mobilized and utilized in order to gain the maximum benefit and the high multiplier effects for our economy.\\nMeasurable medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal objectives include the following headline numbers. These are based on forecasts that are consistent with the guiding principles of coherence of strategies, policy discipline and fiscal sustainability.\\n\\n6.5 to 7.5% real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2022; 6.5 to 8% real GDP growth annually between 2023 to 2028\\n9% or single-digit poverty rate by 2028\\n3% National Government deficit to GDP ratio by 2028\\nLess than 60% National Government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2025\\nAt least 4,256 USD income (GNI) per capita and the attainment of upper middle-income status by 2024\\n\\nThe aforementioned headline goals summarize the objectives of this Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFF) being submitted to Congress, for its adoption and concurrence through a Concurrent Resolution by the Senate and House of Representatives.\\nOnce adopted, the MTFF will become an anchor for the annual spending and financing plan of the National Government and Congress when preparing the annual budget and undertaking related appropriation activities. It is therefore a forward-looking document that extends beyond the traditional three-year horizon to reach six (6) years, coinciding with the six-year coverage of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023 to 2028.\\nThe MTFF also promotes transparency and credible commitment to pursue the indicated socio-macroeconomic goals that optimize the government budget.\\nMedium-term growth targets and the assumptions regarding key macroeconomic variables underpin the medium-term fiscal plan. The recent past and the COVID-19 pandemic has beset the macroeconomic environment with challenges and a series of external shocks. Inflation has accelerated in recent months due largely to significant increases in international prices of oil and other key commodities.\\nStill, the economic growth momentum remains firm as demonstrated by the strong 2022 first quarter GDP growth at 8.3 percent. However, the recovery process from the impact of the pandemic is still on-going amid elevated uncertainty in the international economic environment. Revisions in the macro-economic assumptions incorporate these challenges and most recent economic developments, leading to upward adjustments in the following:\\n\\nInflation rate for 2022 to 2023;\\nForeign exchange rate for 2023 to 2025; and\\nGoods and services imports growth for 2022\\n\\nThe economy is expected to grow by 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year as we continue to reopen the economy while considering the recent external developments.\\nIn the first quarter alone, GDP saw an increase in household consumption and private investments, along with a robust manufacturing industry, high vaccination rate, improved healthcare capacity, and an upward trend in tourism and employment. This is expected to continue for the rest of the year. This strong economic growth is projected to be sustained and expanded further to 6.5 to 8 percent from 2023 until 2028.\\nThe average inflation for 2022 is projected to range from 4.5 to 5.5 percent, following the uptick in fuel and food prices as a result of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the disrupted supply chains.\\nIt is slightly adjusted to 2.5 to 4.5 percent in 2023, and is seen to return to the target range of 2.0 to 4.0 percent by 2024 until 2028.\\nDubai crude oil price is expected to settle at 90 to 110 USD per barrel in 2022, 80 to 100 USD per barrel in 2023, and 70 to 90 USD per barrel from 2024 onwards as oil supply is expected to catch up and stabilize over the medium-term.\\nThe Philippine peso is projected to average between 51 to 53 PhP per US dollar in 2022 and 51 to 55 PhP per US dollar from 2023 onwards due to aggressive monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, market aversion amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and again, increased global oil prices.\\nLastly, exports of goods are expected to grow by 7 percent in 2022, and 6 percent from 2023 to 2028.\\nOn the other hand, imports of goods are projected to grow by 18 percent in 2022, 6 percent in 2023, and 8 percent from 2024 to 2028.\\nI have instructed the NEDA to coordinate with other agencies and work on the Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028 and to submit to me the complete blueprint and progress of its implementation not later than year-end.\\nOne of the main drivers of our push for growth and employment will be in the agricultural sector.\\nWith regard to food supply, we are confronted by a two-pronged problem: that which will hit us in the short term and that which will hit us in the long term.\\nTayo ay nahaharap sa mga problemang kagyat nating mararamdaman at mga hamong pang-matagalan.\\nAng mga suliraning agarang mararamdaman ng ating mga kababayan ay ang posibilidad ng tuloy-tuloy na pagsipa ng presyo ng pagkain at kakulangan sa suplay ng ating pagkain.\\nUpang masuportahan ang mga mamimili para mapanatili ang kanilang purchasing power o kapangyarihan sa pagbili, isinapinal ng Department of Agriculture ang planong taasan ang produksyon sa susunod na panahon ng pagtatanim o planting season, sa pamamagitan ng tulong pinansiyal at teknikal.\\nMagbibigay tayo ng pautang, habang mas ilalapit natin sa sektor ng agrikultura ang hindi gaanong mahal na farm inputs na bibilhin na ng bulto ng gobyerno.\\nKabilang dito ang abono, pestisidyo, mga punla, feeds, fuel subsidy at ayuda para sa mga karapat-dapat na benipisyaryo.\\nPara sa pang-matagalang solusyon: itataas natin ang produksyon ng mga kalakal at produktong pang-agrikultura. At para magawa ito, pagtitibayin natin ang tinatawag na value chain na nagsisimula sa mga magsasaka hanggang sa mga namimili.\\nMay mga bahagi ng value chain na sa ngayon ay kanya-kanya ang operasyon. Pagtibayin natin ang koordinasyon ng iba’t ibang bahagi nito.\\nAng pagsasaliksik para sa mga makabagong paraan ng pagtatanim at pag-aalaga ng hayop ay masusing gagabayan ng Department of Agriculture.\\nAng produksyon ng farm inputs o mga kakailanganin ng mga magsasaka sa pagpapalago ng kanilang sakahan ay ating iaayon sa mga hamong dala ng climate change at global warming.\\nMahigpit na pagsusuri ang gagawin ng ating mga eksperto tungo dito.\\nAng mga pautang at financial assistance sa mga magbubukid at mangingisda ay magiging institusyon at patakaran ng aking administrasyon. []\\nIpaprayoridad natin ang modernisasyon ng mga sakahan sa pamamagitan ng mga makabagong teknolohiya para sa ating mga magsasaka. Ating palalawakin ang mga palaisdaan, babuyan at manukan. Lahat ng ito, gagamitan ng siyensya para tumaas ang produksyong agrikultural. []\\nMaging ang post-production at processing ay susuportahan ng pamahalaan.\\nGagawa tayo ng national network ng farm-to-market roads upang mas mabilis na mailakbay ng mga magsasaka ang kanilang mga produkto sa mga pamilihan.\\nAt gagawa tayo ng mga paraan upang maramdaman ng mga mamimili ang pagluluwag ng presyo ng mga produktong pagkain sa kayang halaga, gaya ng muling pagbubuhay ng mga Kadiwa Centers.\\nHindi ito magagawa sa isang araw, hindi magagawa sa isang buwan, o isang taon lamang.\\nNgunit kailangan na natin simulan NGAYON. []\\nAng agrarian reform program ay dapat magpatuloy.\\nAgrarian reform is not only about acquisition, but also about support services and distribution.\\nTo assist this, I intend to issue an executive order to impose a one-year moratorium on the payment of land amortization and interest payments. []\\nThis is included in Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\\nA moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy. []\\nThe civil society organizations also support this because it will unburden the farmers of their dues and be able to focus on improving farm productivity.\\nCongress must also pass a law that will emancipate the agrarian reform beneficiaries from the agrarian reform debt burden, thereby amending Section 26 of Republic Act 6657.\\nIN THIS LAW, THE LOANS OF AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES WITH UNPAID AMORTIZATION AND INTEREST SHALL BE CONDONED. []\\nLayunin ng batas na ito ay burahin ang hindi mabayarang utang ng ating mga magsasaka na benipisyaryo ng agrarian reform.\\nAgrarian reform beneficiaries who are still to receive their awarded land under the comprehensive agrarian reform program shall receive it without any obligation to pay any amortization. []\\nThe condonation of the existing agrarian reform loan will cover the amount of 58.125 billion pesos benefiting 654,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries and involving a total of 1.18 million hectares of awarded lands. []\\nExecutive Order No. 75, Series of 2019 requires that all government agencies, bureaus, departments and instrumentalities to turn over agricultural lands to qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries.\\nAt present we have a total of 52,000 hectares of unused agricultural lands of the government which shall now be used for distribution to the following sectors in accordance with Section 40 of the Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, thus:\\n\\nLandless war veterans\\nLandless surviving spouse and orphans of war veterans\\nLandless retirees of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police\\n\\nAgricultural lands acquired under this program will be given to graduates of college degrees in agriculture who are landless. []\\nThe call of the times is for the infusion of fresh and new blood in the agricultural sector. We need a new breed of farmers equipped with modern agricultural technology able to engage in sustained scientific farming that will not only increase farm yields, but also resilience in the face of climate change. []\\nThey say that each brand has a story. As for the Filipino brand, ours is deeply rooted in our rich cultural heritage and the tourism sector plays an invaluable role in the promotion of the Filipino brand.\\nTourism is not only an important economic development tool but the abundance of opportunities that the sector creates in terms of regular employment and even job creation at the grassroots level is undeniable.\\nTo boost our tourism industry, we will first and foremost make basic developments such as road improvements for easier access to tourism spots. We will also upgrade our airports and create more international airports [] to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.\\nWe will also make it more convenient for travelers to go around the country, even to remote areas to help promote undiscovered tourist spots. This program will be led by the Department of Tourism, together with the Department of Public Works and Highways. []\\nTo foster the Filipino brand is to spark our sense of pride and reaffirm our strong sense of identity. It is time to welcome the rest of the world with an enhanced Filipino brand that is unique, attractive, and creative.\\nThe creativity of the Filipino is truly world-class. We excel in arts and culture, new media, live events — avenues which generate primary and downstream jobs for our creative and talented countrymen. Unfortunately, ang mga hanapbuhay na ito ang unang pinadapa ng pandemya at ang pinakahuli namang makakabalik sa normal.\\nThe creative industry likewise faces many challenges including workplace conditions, working hours, intellectual property rights, and the welfare of our beloved freelancers who were left vulnerable during the height of the pandemic.\\nWe require an institutionalized creative industry that will advance the interests of its stakeholders — sila na nagbibigay ng kaluluwa at [pagkakilanlan] sa ating pagka-Pilipino. Protektahan natin sila. []\\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development has a large part to play in all of this.\\nMagpapatuloy ang ating pagkalinga sa ating mga kababayan na lubos na nangangailangan.\\nHindi po natin sila pababayaan.\\nMangunguna sa pag-aagapay sa kanila ang Department of Social Welfare and Development.\\nUtos ko sa DSWD ang mabilis na pagtugon sa pangangailangan ng mga biktima ng kalamidad at mga iba’t ibang krisis.\\nAng mga field office nila ay inatasan na maagang maglagak ng family food packs at non-food essentials sa mga LGU, bago pa man manalasa ang anumang kalamidad.\\nMagdadagdag tayo ng mga operations center, warehouse at imbakan ng relief goods, lalo na sa mga malalayong lugar na mahirap marating.\\nTitiyakin natin na maayos ang koordinasyon ng DSWD at Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development ng sa ganun, madali ang pagpapatupad ng Emergency Shelter Assistance program para sa mga biktima ng kahit anong kalamidad. []\\nPagtitibayin pa natin ang komprehensibong programang ‘Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations’ o ang ating tinatawag na AICS, para maiparating ang tulong sa mas maraming biktima. []\\nHindi natin papahirapan ang mga biktima ng krisis na dudulog sa ahensiya — gagawin nating simple ang proseso ng paghingi at pagpaparating ng tulong. Dahil hindi naman dapat dinadagdagan pa ang hirap na nararanasan ng ating mga mamamayan.\\nUpang matiyak na mapupunta sa kwalipikadong mga pamilya ang tulong ng pamahalaan sa pamamagitan ng 4Ps o Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, titiyakin natin na malilinis ang listahan ng benipisyaryo. []\\nHigit na sa isang milyong pangalan na ang naka-graduate na sa listahan. At nagagalak akong mabatid na sila ay nakakatayo na sa kanilang sariling paa.\\nKaugnay nito ay inutusan ko ang DSWD na pag-ibayuhin pa ang pagrepaso ng listahan upang maitutok ang pamimigay ng sapat na ayuda sa mga lubos na nangangailangang pamilya.\\nMagpapatuloy ang supplemental feeding program para sa mga bata sa Child Development Centers at Supervised Neighborhood Play, at lalo pa nating palalawakin sa taong 2023. []\\nHindi rin natin nakakalimutan ang mga solo parents at mga nanay na nahiwalay sa kanilang mga mister dahil sa karahasan.\\nPagtitibayin natin ang programa sa Violence Against Women and Their Children, kabilang na ang counselling para sa mga biktima, katuwang ang ating mga LGU.\\nTiyakin natin na sapat ang pondo sa halos pitumpong residential care centers at pitong non-residential care centers para sa vulnerable sectors at persons with disabilities na sumisilong dito.\\nSa ating sitwasyon ng pangkalusugan, nariyan pa rin ang banta ng COVID-19, lalo’t may mga nadidiskubreng bagong variants ng coronavirus. Pero hindi na natin kakayanin ang isa pang lockdown. Wala na tayong gagawing lockdown. []\\nDapat nating balansehin nang maayos ang kalusugan at kapakanan ng ating mga mamamayan sa isang banda, at ang ekonomiya naman sa kabilang banda.\\nNakikipagtulungan ang iba’t ibang ahensya ng pamahalaan sa pag-monitor sa mga COVID-19 hospital admission upang makatiyak tayo na may sapat na kapasidad ang ating health care system at maiwasan ang pagsipa ng bilang ng nagkakasakit.\\nPatuloy din ang ating vaccine booster rollout para sa ating pangkalahatang depensa. []\\nSa ganitong paraan, kahit pa tumaas muli ang bilang ng mga COVID cases, mananatiling mababa ang bilang ng mga maospital at bilang ng mga namamatay.\\nSa pamamagitan nito, unti-unti rin tayong masasanay na nariyan ang virus pero hindi na seryoso ang banta sa ating buhay.\\nIaayon natin ang ating mga health protocols sa kung ano ang ating pangangailangan sa paglipas ng panahon at lalo pang iibayuhin ang kooperasyon kasama ang pribadong sektor upang tumaas pa ang kumpyansa ng mga mamumuhunan, nang sa gayon ay bumalik na tayo sa “full capacity” lalong-lalo na ang ating mga negosyo. []\\nPagbubutihin pa natin ang pagpapakalat ng tamang impormasyon ukol sa COVID, kasama ang kahalagahan ng bakuna.\\nMananatili muna sa ngayon ang ating Alert Level System natin. Pinapag-aralan natin ang ibang paraan ng klasipikasyon upang mas babagay sa kasalukuyang sitwasyon lalong-lalo na sa pagbabago ng COVID.\\nSa pakikipagtulungan ng Kongreso, itatatag natin ang ating sariling Center for Disease Control and Prevention at ang isang vaccine institute. []\\nMagtatayo tayo ng dagdag na mga health center at ospital.\\nBut beyond the issues that the pandemic has brought, the need for a stronger health care system is self-evident. We must bring medical services to the people and not wait for them to come to our hospitals and health care centers. []\\nNapakinabangan natin nang husto ang malalaking specialty hospitals gaya ng Heart Center, Lung Center, Children’s Hospital at National Kidney and Transplant Institute. Kaya maliwanag na na hindi lang dapat dito sa National Capital Region, kundi maging sa ibang parte ng bansa… [ and cheers] Maliwanag na hindi lamang dapat dito lamang sa National Capital Region kundi maging sa ibang parte ng bansa kailangan magdagdag ng ganitong uri ng mga pagamutan. []\\nBukod dito, upang mailapit natin ang health care system sa taumbayan nang hindi sila kailangang pumunta sa sentro ng kanilang bayan, lalawigan o region, ay maglalagay tayo ng mga clinic, mga RHU na pupuntahan ng mga doktor, nurse, midwife, medtech, isang beses, dalawang beses sa isang linggo — nang sa gayon, magiging mas madali sa may karamdaman na magpapagamot nang hindi na kailangang magbiyahe nang malayo. []\\nOne of the cornerstones of a strong healthcare system is the provision of competent and efficient medical professionals. We will exert all efforts to improve the welfare of our doctors, our nurses, and other medical frontliners. []\\nDapat din tayong magkaroon ng sapat na suplay ng gamot na kinakailangan sa pang-araw-araw ng ating mga mamamayan.\\nSinimulan ko na ang pakikipag-usap sa mga kumpanya ng gamot dito sa Pilipinas at sa ibang bansa. Hinihikayat natin na buksan nila ang merkado upang bumaba ang presyo ng gamot. []\\nHalimbawa, kung mas marami ang mas murang generic o hindi branded na gamot sa merkado, mas bababa rin ang presyo dahil sa kumpetisyon.\\nAng Department of Trade and Industry ay nakikipag-usap sa mga interesadong manufacturer ng generic drugs na papasok sa ating bansa. []\\nInuutusan ko naman ang Philippine Competition Commission na pantay-pantay dapat at walang kartel sa hanay ng mga pharmaceutical companies. [ and cheers] Dahil kapag bukas ang merkado, bababa ang presyo ng gamot para mapakinabangan ng ating mga mamamayan.\\nThis is one of the hard lessons that we learned when the pandemic struck, and therefore, we must act on that shortcoming. []\\nIn the educational sector, I believe it is time for our children to return to full face-to-face classes once again. []\\nThe Department of Education, led by our highly able Vice President Sara Duterte, [] is now preparing for its implementation in the upcoming school year, with utmost consideration for the safety of students, as we are still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWe must ensure that our classrooms are safe for teachers, for students, and the entire academic community when they return to face-to-face classes.\\nWe continue to encourage everyone to get their booster shots in preparation for the resumption of in-person classes. []\\nThis is one of the reasons I have directed the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to undertake another rollout of booster shots. []\\nThe condition and availability of school rooms for our students must also be addressed, again, in coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways.\\nThough some complications have arisen over the question of repair of school buildings in relation to the Mandanas-Garcia ruling, this will be ironed out.\\nWe have been in discussion with local government leaders, Governors and Mayors, in the last few weeks to determine, with the LGUs, what is actually practicable, what functions belong to the LGUs and what belong to the National Government.\\nThere have also been lengthy discussions on the continuation and viability of the K to 12 school system. We are giving this a careful review, and all necessary inputs and points of view are now being considered.\\nIn the longer term, we are instituting a program of refresher courses and re-trainings for our teachers so they can stay abreast of the rapid growth in technology, especially in this post-pandemic world. []\\nAs for the ‘horror’ stories that we have heard about the poor quality of educational materials and supplies that are being given to our schools — this must end! []\\nOur children must always be equipped with the best that we can provide.\\nAng edukasyon ay ang tangi nating pamana sa ating mga anak na hindi mawawaldas. Kaya anumang gastusin sa kanilang pag-aaral ay hindi tayo nagtitipid. Hindi rin tayo nagtatapon.\\nAnd once again, I am not talking about history, or what is being taught. I am talking about materials that are necessary for effective teaching in this day and age.\\nChildren now need connectivity to the internet; they need devices to use; they need computers, educational tools [] so that they might participate fully in the digital community here and abroad.\\nWe must do better in the international rankings especially when it comes to the so-called STEM subjects: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.\\nThese skills and this knowledge are necessary for our young people to be able to compete in a highly technological and competitive world.\\nThe raw talent is there in our young people. It is up to our educational system to develop and to refine that great pool of talent. []\\nForeign employers have always favored Filipino employees because of our command of the English language. This is an advantage that we must continue to enjoy.\\nThe internet has now become the global marketplace. Not only for goods services but also for ideas, even extending to our own personal interactions.\\nThe language of the internet — for better or for worse — is English.\\nTherefore, the question of our medium of instruction must be continuously re-examined to maintain that advantage that we have established as an English-speaking people. []\\nOn a related subject, we are entering an age of exponential adoption of technology. It is the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\\nThis will be characterized by the infusion of technology into almost every facet of our lives. Breakthrough technologies in the areas of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, nano technologies, the internet of things, robotics, self-driving electric vehicles, 3D printing, Virtual and Augmented Reality, among others that will radically transform the way business is done.\\nThe scale and the speed at which these innovations are introduced universally into our everyday lives and activities is unprecedented in our recorded history.\\nWe cannot stand idly by.\\nThe mission of our Department of Information and Communications Technology is to identify and utilize these innovations to improve governance.\\nIt has the daunting task now of transforming our government into an agile bureaucracy that is responsive to the needs of the public, provide good and solid data to ensure informed decision-making, as well as allow secure and seamless access to public services.\\nThe voluminous records stored in the government warehouses and archives have to be digitized. Those that are already stored in various inventories of data should be harmonized and shared across departments and agencies.\\nNeedless to say, these have to be kept in large data centers that are secure yet accessible.\\nThe National ID will play an important part in this digital transformation. []\\nFor citizens to be able to seamlessly transact with government, their identity must be easily verifiable.\\nWe expect to issue 30-million physical IDs and 20-million digital IDs by the end of this year. [] The target is to accomplish the issuance of about 92-million IDs by the middle of next year.\\nAs the world moves into rapid digitalization, the digital divide will become more pronounced. The depth and breadth at which these technologies will be transformative in our lives is fully expected.\\nThis will open new opportunities for the creation of wealth but will also likely create inequalities.\\nHence, universal connectivity will be a vital component in order to ensure that no citizen is left behind. []\\nI have therefore tasked the DICT to deploy digital connectivity across our various islands. This will be done through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, the common tower program, connecting our Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA) via our ‘Broad Band ng Masa’ project. []\\nAll relevant modes of digital transport should be utilized. These may be through a combination of terrestrial or submarine fiber optics, wireless and even satellite technology.\\nAs our Public Service Act has opened the doors and removed the restrictions on foreign investment, we foresee an increase in direct investment of overseas players.\\nThis will translate into better quality, availability and affordability of telecommunications services all over the country.\\nWe come now to infrastructure. The backbone of an economy is its infrastructure.\\nThe infrastructure program of the Duterte administration must not only continue but, wherever possible, be expanded. []\\nWe shall confidently build on this firm foundation established by my predecessor. As it is in building an edifice.\\nWe must keep the momentum. And aspire to BUILD BETTER MORE.\\nNecessarily, infrastructure development will remain a very high priority in our drive for growth and employment.\\nOnce again, I will not suspend any of the ongoing projects as those have already been shown to be of benefit to the public that they serve. []\\nWe will continue to study the proposals that have been made.\\nInfrastructure development spending will be sustained at 5% to 6% of GDP.\\nThe planned expansion of infrastructure projects, I believe, would be possible if we continue to encourage the participation of the private sector in the development of our programs.\\nPublic Private Partnerships or PPPs hold great potential for that expansion, [] for infrastructure development and for innovation.\\nOur infrastructure development is of primary importance as it is a necessary element to improve many other sectors — to include agriculture, tourism, general economic activity, and even to governance.\\nIt is my belief also that we have missed some great opportunities to develop our rail transport system.\\nIt is clear in my mind that railways offer great potential as it continues to be the cheapest way of transporting goods and passengers.\\nWe can build upon already existing lines by modernizing these old railway systems.\\nThere are dozens of railway projects – on the ground, above the ground, below ground, not just in Manila, but in other regions – at various stages of implementation, and with a combined cost of 1.9 trillion pesos. []\\nThis Administration is committed to finish building the current portfolio of investments: approved railway projects such as the North-South Commuter Railway System, [] the 33-kilometer Metro Manila Subway Project, the 147-kilometer North-South Commuter Railway System, the 12-kilometer LRT-1 Cavite Extension, [] the 23-kilometer MRT-7, and the Common Station that will connect LRT-1, MRT-3 and MRT-7.\\nAnd beyond NCR, larger scale railway systems like the 102-kilometer Mindanao Railway Project; [] the Panay Railway Project; [] and the Cebu railway system will be integrated as a vital part of our transport and communications systems.\\nWe will also continue to improve our roads and transportation systems in key cities throughout the country through various projects such as the Cebu Bus Rapid Transit, Davao High Priority Bus System, Ilocos Norte Transportation Hub, and the El Nido Transport Terminal. []\\nMy order to the Department of Transportation or DOTr is really very simple: FULL SPEED AHEAD! []\\nImproving our railway system, along with modernizing existing airports and seaports, will maximize our strategic location in the Pacific. And connect our many islands.\\nA key sector in our transformation plans is that of energy.\\nAnother fundamental requirement for growth and increased employment will be the availability of cheap, reliable energy. This even comes under the category of “ease of doing business”. If we are to attract investors, both local and foreign, to set up shop here in the Philippines.\\nAt present, our demand for energy far exceeds our reliable supply. We must increase the level of energy production. We must look at every possible option that would be appropriate for the Philippine situation. There is some room to expand our present power supply through existing power sources, but this is only to a very limited extent. We must build new power plants. [] We must take advantage of all the best technology that is now available, especially in the areas of renewable energy. []\\nOur search for new power sources should always be with an eye to improving the mix of the energy supply between traditional and renewable sources.\\nThe technology on renewable energy is progressing rapidly. And many of these technologies are appropriate for the Philippines. We have already begun windmill power. We are now expanding very quickly our solar power production.\\nFor both offshore and on-shore wind turbines, for example, the World Bank has calculated that there is the potential of 255 gigawatts by the year of 2030. []\\nSolar power has steadily increased its efficiency in converting sunlight to electrical power, which is particularly attractive for the Philippines. Because unlike wind power, solar power is practical almost everywhere in the Philippines all year round.\\nIn the move to lowering our carbon footprint caused by energy production, our advancement to renewables will have a lead time.\\nIn the interim, natural gas will hold the key. We will provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly in the area close to Malampaya.\\nThis requires clarification of the processes and review of service contracts policy.\\nI believe that it is time also to re-examine our strategy towards building nuclear power plants in the Philippines. []\\nWe will comply of course with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after Fukushima. In the area of nuclear power, there have been new technologies developed that allow smaller scale modular nuclear plants and other derivations thereof.\\nOnce again, PPPs will play a part in support as funding in this period is limited. []\\nFurthermore, we must examine the entire system of transmission and distribution for the purpose of finding ways to lower the price of energy to the consumer and to industry.\\nWe must expand the network of our transmission lines while examining schemes to improve the operation of our electrical cooperatives. All this in aid of reducing energy cost especially but not limited to households. []\\nAll this impetus for development and growth, we undertake within the context of accelerating climate change and extreme weather conditions.\\nThough we are a minor contributor to climate change globally, we have the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.\\nFor the welfare of our people, it is incumbent upon us to alleviate the effects of that vulnerability.\\nThe use of renewable energy is at the top of our climate agenda. We will increase our use of renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal power, solar, and wind.\\nGeographically, we are a disaster-prone country. Capacity building for our natural disaster resiliency is therefore a must. Investment in science and technology is imperative to enable us to have accurate weather forecasts and on-time disaster alerts.\\nStudies show that already now many areas in the Philippines are at high risk from the rise in sea levels brought about by the increase in global temperature. We must adapt to this phenomenon with disaster-proof planning of our communities.\\nWe will also look into the precarious fresh water supply situation in the country, especially in our urban areas. Many of our water supply systems date back to the 1950’s, and they must now be rehabilitated and improved.\\nI have instructed the DENR together with the DPWH, to explore possible partnerships with the private sector to address this crucial situation.\\nThe Philippines has excellent laws on the environment, but we have to guarantee that these laws are properly enforced. And this will require a great deal of coordination and cooperation between concerned government agencies and private stakeholders.\\nCompanies who exploit our natural resources must follow the law. We all have the responsibility to preserve this Earth, for we are but custodians, and we will pass on this great treasure to future generations. []\\nThere is no question that the preservation of the environment is the preservation of life. []\\nIf we cannot mitigate climate change, all our plans for the economy, all our plans for our future, will be for naught.\\nBawat Pilipino sa ibayong dagat na nagsasakripisyong lisanin ang kanyang pamilya sa Pilipinas upang mag-hanapbuhay ay nararapat lamang magkaroon ng pamahalaang matatawag nilang “tahanan” habang nasa ibang bayan. []\\nIto ang papel na gagampanan ng Kagawaran ng Manggagawang Mandarayuhan o Department of Migrant Workers matapos itong ideklara bilang ganap na ahensiya ng gobyerno noong isang taon. []\\nAng kagawarang ito ang magsisilbing kanlungan ng ating mga kababayan sa gitna ng mundong walang kasiguruhan at mahigpit na kumpetisyon. Ito ang maglalatag sa kanila ng mga oportunidad; titiyak na ang kanilang mga hanapbuhay ay tugma sa kanilang mga kasanayan; maninigurong akma ang sahod at maayos ang kalagayan sa kanilang mga kumpanya; at mangangalaga sa kanilang mga pamilya habang sila ay nasa malayo.\\nGagawin natin ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-aalis ng red tape sa sistema ng pagsusulong ng digital empowerment. We shall automate the verification of contracts and issue secure Overseas Employment Certifications (OEC) that you can keep on your smartphone. I call on the Department of Migrant Workers and the DICT to make this a top priority. []\\nTinatawagan ko rin ang Department of Foreign Affairs na makipagtulungan sa Department of Migrant Workers na tiyakin ang lahat ng mga diplomatic post ay tutulong na agarang maibalik sa trabaho ang mga ating mga Overseas Filipino workers na nawalan ng hanapbuhay nitong nakalipas na ilang taon. []\\nMula sa tatlong buwan ay gagawin na lang nating tatlong linggo para sa isang dayuhang employer na i-proseso ang mga papeles ng Pilipinong nais nitong kunin bilang empleyado. []\\nAatasan din natin ang kagawaran na gawing simple ang kumplikadong handbook ng mga tuntunin at regulasyon para sa mga OFW, nang sa gayon ay maging maalwan ang mga transaksyong may kinalaman sa kanilang pangingibang-bansa.\\nMula sa handbook na may dalawang daan at apatnapung (240) seksyon ay gagawin nating pamphlet na lamang na hindi hihigit sa isandaang pahina. []\\nMahirap na nga ang buhay, kaya naman ayaw pa natin makitang lalo pang nahihirapan ang ating mga manggagawang mandarayuhan sa pagtupad sa kanilang mga pangarap.\\nPara sa mga kababayan nating naiipit sa kaguluhan, inaabuso, at nanganganib ang buhay, ikinagagalak kong sa ilalim ng aking pamumuno, ay ilulunsad natin ang One Repatriation Command Center o ORCC. Ilalaan natin ang isang social media platform ng Department of Migrant Workers at ang hotline upang matulungan agad at mailigtas sila mula sa mas higit na kapahamakan. []\\nNoon, nangungutang pa ang isang ina ng bawat OFW upang sumakay ng barko para pumunta sa Maynila at mangatok sa iba’t ibang ahensiya para mapauwi ang anak na inaapi. Ngayon, kami na ang tatawag sa mga magulang ng OFWs [] para sabihin sa kanila ang petsa kung kailan nila mayayakap at makakapiling ang kanilang mga anak. []\\nSa kasalukuyan ay nakikipag-ugnayan tayo sa pamahalaan ng Saudi Arabia upang buksang muli ang deployment. Kaya natin, at gagawin natin, ang makipag-negosasyon na mabigyan ang ating mga kababayan doon ng tamang pasahod, at mapangalagaan ang kanilang karapatan at kapakanan.\\nMuli nating pagtitibayin ang respeto at pagkakaibigan ng ating dalawang bansa tulad ng namagitan sa aking ama at sa kanilang hari.\\nSa mga susunod na buwan ay magtutungo si Secretary Susan Ople sa Saudi Arabia upang tiyakin na may sapat na puwersang magsisiguro na mabubuksang muli ang empleyo sa bansa, [] at para maisulong ang ating kampanya laban sa human trafficking.\\nNgayon, para naman sa mga anak na naiwan sa Pilipinas. Titiyakin ng Department of Migrant Workers, sa pamamagitan ng OWWA, na sila ay maipapasok sa magagandang paaralang magtuturo sa kanila ng financial literacy, mental wellness, sports, sining at kultura. Ito ay mangyayari sa pakikipagtulungan ng iba’t ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaan. Alagaan natin ang kabataang Pilipino sapagkat sila ang kinabukasan ng ating Inang Bayan. []\\nSa ating mga kababayan na nasa ibang bansa: You deserve a Home in Government not only for the money that you send home, but you are not cold tools of the economy. You deserve it for your sacrifices, for our country and your perseverance and excellence in the global arena.\\nYou, OFWs, represent the fighting faith of the Filipinos as a nation and as a people. Let us transform your overseas journey into inspirational stories for all time.\\nThanks to you, our dear legislators, and of course, to the man, every OFW now refers to as their “Tatay”, President Rodrigo Duterte. You passed the law that created this new home for our OFWs. []\\nOn the area of foreign policy, I will not preside over any process that will abandon even one square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power. [ and cheers]\\nWith respect to our place in the community of nations, the Philippines shall continue to be a friend to all, an enemy to none.\\nThe Philippines has always been open and welcoming to all our foreign friends and visitors. That is our world view, that is our culture.\\nBUT LET ME BE CLEAR. WE ARE VERY JEALOUS OF ALL THAT IS FILIPINO. []\\nWe will be a good neighbor — always looking for ways to collaborate and cooperate with the end goal of mutually beneficial outcomes.\\nIf we agree, we will cooperate and we will work together. And if we differ, let us talk some more until we develop a consensus.\\nAfter all, that is THE FILIPINO WAY.\\nBut we will not waver. We will stand firm in our independent foreign policy, with the national interest as our primordial guide. []\\nWe commit to maintaining good relations with the rest of the world.\\nAs a matter of fact, it is my sincere belief that the need for strong bonds and collaboration among nations emerges in the direst of times, such as in a pandemic.\\nThe partnerships and alliances that we make with all will provide the stability that all nations will need as we emerge into this new global economy.\\nThe Philippines will continue to promote stronger and multi-faceted relationships with all our partners around the world.\\nWe are, in fact, grateful for the messages of support and offers of help that we have received from many of our friends in the international community. This has been communicated to us through the different Envoys and the Ambassadors here in the Philippines.\\nSuch strong relationships can only be beneficial to all involved.\\nAs I am here today addressing the legislature, allow me now to propose legislation that we would like you to pass in support of these programs:\\n1. National Government Rightsizing Program (NGRP) []\\nA reform mechanism that seeks to enhance the government’s institutional capacity to perform its mandate and to provide better services, while ensuring optimal and efficient use of resources.\\nCompared to previous government reorganization efforts, the NGRP will entail a comprehensive strategic review of the functions, operations, organization, systems and processes of the different agencies, and massive and transformational initiatives in agencies concerned, such as mergers, consolidation, splitting, transfer, and even the abolition of some offices.

                 \\nMessage\\nof\\nHis Excellency Manuel L. Quezon \\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly on National Defense\\n[Delivered in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building on November 25, 1935]\\nMr. Speaker, gentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nAs I appear before you for the first time, allow me to extend to you my cordial greetings and congratulations upon your election to this august body. It is your unique privilege to serve our country at the most critical period of its existence—at a time when the course of its destiny will be charted.\\nThe framers of our Constitution conferred upon our Government all the power and authority needed to meet the demands of a progressive and enlightened epoch so that it may be able to promote the welfare and happiness of our people and safeguard their liberty.\\nI know you are well aware of the share of responsibility in the task of government which belongs to you. Unlike the Legislature that preceded you, which had two Houses, this National Assembly is by itself the whole Legislative Department of the government. When you take final action on a measure, there is no other legislative branch that will pass upon and give it further consideration. The measure as you pass it goes directly to the Chief Executive, who is devoid of any power to alter it in any way and has no alternative except that of giving it his express or implied approval, or of vetoing it.\\nIn my opinion, the main responsibility for legislative action is yours. It will be my policy as Chief Executive to give you, in every case, the benefit of doubt. You may, therefore, rest assured that, if ever, I shall exercise my veto power with reluctance, and only when I am strongly convinced that it is my plain and unavoidable duty to do so in the interest of the common weal.\\nArticle VII, section 11, (5) of the Constitution directs the President to present to the National Assembly, from time to time, information on the state of the Nation, and to recommend to its consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.\\nIn the fulfillment of this duty, I am addressing the National Assembly today on the fundamental responsibility of a state—on a question involving our very existence when we become a free member of the family of nations. This question is that of assuring the future safety of our beloved country.\\nSelf-defense is the supreme right of mankind, no more sacred to the individual than to the nation, the interests of which are immeasurably of greater significance and extent. A threat against the nation involves not alone the life of one individual, but of millions; not the welfare and fortune of a single family, but of all. And above everything else, depending upon the exercise of the right of national self-defense is freedom itself, the most precious reward from Heaven to the worthy. This immutable principle is firmly incorporated in our Constitution—the Magna Charta of Philippine Liberty.\\nWe, the citizens of these Islands, are now fairly started upon the final stretch of the long road we have so patiently and persistently followed toward the goal of independence. Up to here the trail has been a tortuous one. But the difficulties we have encountered and the frustrations we have endured have not deterred us from our purpose. They have served only to spur us onward—to increase the intensity of our undying devotion to the cause for which no cost could be too great, no sacrifice too bitter. And now at last, with success so plainly in our sight, our love of liberty and the voice of reason alike urge us to guard and cherish the prize that has been so hardly won.\\nI would be recreant to my duty did I not come to you, in my first appearance before the National Assembly, to ask your ungrudging support for the establishment of a sound system of National Defense. This is our first and most urgent need.\\nAs we commit ourselves to this important task we realize that a war-weary world groans under a burden of armaments. Every accretion to the accumulated total is invariably subjected to careful and even suspicious scrutiny. But the world must be well aware that in the present state of our development, the establishment within these Islands of an aggressive force capable of threatening the security of any other nation would be fantastic. Consequently, without fear that any act of ours may be misunderstood or resented by others, we are free to undertake every preparatory measure of defense that the circumstances of our situation may require.\\nNevertheless, it is well that we now announce, through clear delineation of our objective, definite limits upon the efforts we shall make in this direction. That objective is a single one—peace—permanent peace! This objective is proclaimed in our own Constitution and no Filipino dares to challenge it. No purpose of our own, no conceivable temptation or manipulation from abroad, can ever lead us into war save in defense of our own rights, waged within the limits of our own territory. Our full desire is to insure domestic tranquillity and to guarantee to our citizens the opportunity to pursue, without external molestation, prosperity and happiness under a stable government, devised, developed, and maintained by the people themselves.\\nIn furtherance of this purpose I shall submit to you a comprehensive plan for national defense. In my opinion the plan reflects the lessons of history, the conclusions of acknowledged masters of warfare and of statesmanship, and the sentiments and aspirations of the Filipino people. It is founded upon enduring principles that are fundamental to any plan applicable to our needs.\\nThe first of these principles is that every citizen is obligated to the nation’s defense. All the individual and national resources may be used by the State in the interest of self-preservation. No man has the inalienable right to enjoy the privileges and opportunities conferred upon him by free institutions unless he simultaneously acknowledges his duty to defend with his life and with his property the Government through which he acquires these opportunities and these privileges. To deny this individual responsibility is to reject the whole theory of democratic government.\\nThis principle knows no limitation of time or condition. It is effective in war, in peace, and for as long as the nation shall endure. Impelled by cogent reasons I propose its specific application to our peace-time task of preparation, by requiring every citizen of suitable age and physique to undergo military training as an obligation to the State.\\nThe ultimate bulwark of liberty is the readiness of free citizens to sacrifice themselves in defense of that boon. Where this spirit has been inculcated through generations and has become firmly embedded in the public consciousness, nations have been strong, virile, prosperous, and stable. Where citizens have grown neglectful of this individual obligation, especially where they have sought to deny its validity, the result has been decadence, weakness, poverty, and destruction.\\nTo foster national pride and patriotism nothing is more effective than to participate actively in the processes of maintaining the national defense. Military training and service build up the spirit of duty and love of country. They nurture patriotism, loyalty, courage, and discipline. A nation of trained men ready to defend their country has the lasting respect of itself and of the world. A nation of helpless citizens can expect nothing but slavery at home, and contempt abroad. If we are wise, if we are mindful of the lessons history teaches, we will provide a military education for our entire manhood, beginning from early adolescence. To accomplish this purpose a utilization of the public-school system immediately suggests itself. By inculcating in rising generations the soldierly virtues, by preparing our people spiritually and physically to serve the state, our schools will be building upon solid foundations not only national consciousness and solidarity but also boldness of spirit which are indispensable to the free and uninterrupted development of this nation.\\nThe second basic principle is that our national defense system must provide actual security. Indeed, an insufficient defense is almost a contradiction in terms. A dam that crumbles under the rising flood is nothing more than a desolate monument to the wasted effort and lack of vision of its builders. In this one function of government there can be no compromise with minimum requirements. Our program of national defense must serve notice upon the world that the citizens of these Islands are not to be subjugated; that conquest of this nation cannot be accomplished short of its utter destruction, and that that destruction would involve such staggering cost to an aggressor, both in blood and gold, that even the boldest and the strongest will unerringly mark the folly of such an undertaking.\\nThe next principle to which I hold is the insistent need for current and future economy. Although there are no costs of peace comparable to those that would surely follow defeat in war, it is nevertheless incumbent upon the Government to avoid every unnecessary expenditure. During the three centuries of Philippine history as a dependency, there have been largely lifted from our shoulders the burdens incident to sovereignty, particularly those of providing for our own protection. These burdens our people now gladly accept. They stand ready to pay the cost, whatever it may be, of assuring the permanent security and integrity of the homeland. But for us in the Government, to permit this cost to exceed the minimum demanded by the purpose that we seek would be an inexcusable blunder and a betrayal of the trust reposed in us.\\nThe need for minimizing expense not only requires the utmost efficiency in details, but also it clearly indicates the basic character of the defensive establishment we must devise. Specifically, it precludes, for the present at least, the development of a battle fleet. Naval strength is expressed principally in terms of fighting ships, each of which, even in the small and auxiliary categories, can be produced only at tremendous cost. It is manifestly impossible, in the current state of our economic development, to acquire a fleet that could offer even partially effective resistance to any existing navy worthy of the name.\\nOne desirable effect of a decision to forego the construction of a battle fleet will be to emphasize the passively defensive character of our military establishment. Tactically, a fleet cannot operate as a purely defensive force and is useless unless it can proceed to see and engage its enemy beyond the limits of its own bases. Moreover, the existence of a powerful navy inherently implies a possibility of aggressive intent, since only with strong naval support could an army hope to invade the territory of an overseas enemy. Consequently, as an island nation, our lack of sea power will confirm before the world our earnest intent to develop an army solely for defensive purposes.\\nAnother fundamental premise is the necessity for a gradual rather than sudden growth of the required defense establishment. Both economy and efficiency demand no immediate and complete organization of a force of the necessary eventual strength. A modern army is a complex organism, and its defensive power is not measured solely by the number of its soldiers. Suitable armament, proper organization, professional technique and skill, applicable tactical doctrine and, above all, trained leadership are the very soul of an army’s combat efficiency. However lavish may be the expenditure, these things cannot be instantly acquired. They are brought about only through thoughtful, painstaking, and persistent effort, intelligently directed. Progress in these fields will determine the rate at which the whole development, including increases in personnel strength, may logically and efficiently proceed.\\nNevertheless, it is imperative that our plans reach fruition by the time the beneficent protection of the United States shall have been finally withdrawn. We have ten years, and only ten, in which to initiate and complete the development of our defensive structure, the creation of which, because of the conditions of our past existence, must now begin at the very foundations. Not a moment is to be lost. Starting immediately, we must build economically and gradually, but steadily and surely, so as to attain within the time permitted us the highest possible efficiency at the lowest possible cost.\\nFinally, I must emphasize the need for logical governmental procedure in this development—a procedure calculated to minimize error and to avoid loss of time, waste of resources, and unnecessary exposure of the country to the risks of unpreparedness. Since our security arrangements must be carefully moulded to fit the special and particular needs of our country, there exists nowhere in the world a model upon which our own defenses may be blindly patterned. Step by step we must design a new organism, and in doing so we must advance progressively from the general to the specific; from the explored to the unexplored. A continuous adjustment of essential details to constantly evolving requirements will be mandatory. Such a procedure will be possible only through the exercise of administrative authority, taking advantage of the highest professional and technical advice. But since under our form of government, administrative authority is limited to the task of execution, it is highly important that initial legislation for the erection of the nation’s defenses should confer upon the President as Commander-in-Chief, a very considerable latitude in carrying out the expressed purposes of the National Assembly. Any attempt, at the outset of this undertaking, to formulate a plan that would prescribe in concrete and inflexible language every detail of the complete development could not fail to result in added cost and slow progress.\\nThe essential elements of our defensive system will in time become more clearly crystallized and definitely moulded to the needs of the nation. Then, it will be time for the National Assembly to enact legislation with such details as it may deem desirable.\\nBut though details of design in the superstructure of defense should, at least for the present, be charged to the Chief Executive, the Assembly must retain the responsibility of assuring the soundness of its foundations. It is not only the prerogative but also the duty of the Legislative Department to evolve and to prescribe the broad policies that are to control progress in this critically important task. Likewise it is a function of the Legislative Body to bestow specific authorization and to provide the funds essential to the purpose it seeks. Supported by such authority and guided by these policies, the Chief Executive will be enabled to proceed confidently and expeditiously toward the accomplishment of the legislative intent.\\nThe central feature of the defensive system I propose is a trained and organized force, normally engaged in the pursuits of peace, and ready for effective employment whenever the interests of the nation so demand. Service in this force is to be rendered as a patriotic obligation to the state. Upon reaching maturity, each able-bodied male citizen will automatically become liable for a period of intensive military training. From the number annually attaining this age, a training quota of the required size will be selected by lot. Moreover, so far as the capacity of the Army will permit, volunteers from among those not so selected, or from older age groups, will be incorporated into the training cadres. Upon completion of his training period, each citizen will return to civil life, but as a member of an Army reserve unit. Thus the burden of defense will be widely distributed, and each citizen will devote to exclusive military activity only an insignificant portion of his time.\\nThe regular element of the Army, composed of volunteers from every geographical area of the Islands, will eventually attain a maximum strength of 1,500 officers and 19,000 enlisted men, including the existing Constabulary. Its officers and men will pursue the military profession as a life’s career and devote themselves exclusively to the nation’s defense. The Regular Army must become a model of efficiency—the energizing element and, professionally, the directing head of the whole establishment. Its missions will comprehend the maintenance of permanent overhead for the entire force, including such essential services as procurement, storage, transportation, communication, and sanitation; the prosecution of research and experimentation to keep the Army abreast of latest developments in every branch of the military profession; and instruction of the reserve.\\nIn organizational and operational outline the proposed system is the essence of simplicity. Under its provisions the Chief of Staff of the Army is selected by and is directly responsible to the President, and will have the rank of a Secretary of Department. Under him will be a Department of National Defense comprising the several staff sections required for general supervision of the whole military establishment and for the control of administration, training, maintenance, and other essential functions.\\nThe reserve units will be dispersed through all the Islands, approximately according to population. The national territory will be divided into military districts and subdistricts, in each of which will be maintained a small professional cadre for the training of the annual quota locally called to the colors. Training periods except for trainees selected to serve with the Regular Force will normally extend over a period of five and a half months. Thereafter, for ten years, each trainee will be required to undergo annually sufficient training to preserve individual and collective efficiency. From that time onward his training will grow progressively less.\\nUnder this system we will have, within ten years, hundreds of thousands of trained individuals, and eventually practically the entire male population will have had military training. The younger men of this group will be constantly organized into tactical formations. Supporting these units will be a pool of trained individuals, generally in higher age groups, but available in emergency for replacements in line organizations or for employment in staff services. Equipment and supplies for reserve organizations will be locally stored and maintained, under the control of professionally trained cadres.\\nSupplementing the training given in the Army will be the military instructional system in schools and colleges. Every educational institution wholly or partially supported at public expense is to serve, under the plan, as an agency for inculcating patriotism and for assisting in the important work of instructing our people in the essentials of the military profession. Starting with students, aged ten, intensive courses in citizenship, sanitation, and physical development will be progressively widened in scope during the period of adolescence, until at the age of eighteen, every able-bodied male student will have pursued a thorough course in elementary military practices and methods. As a consequence, even though quotas annually trained in the Army will comprise only a portion of the young men attaining the age of twenty-one, we will eventually acquaint our entire male population with the essential requirements of military service.\\nThe plan provides a comprehensive system for the emergency mobilization of the reserves so as to insure rapid, concerted, and efficient action in the face of emergency. It proposes yearly objectives in the procurement of armaments and equipment. All these things and many others, I have developed in as exhaustive detail as is now possible, to the end that my proposals to the National Assembly might comprise concrete rather than theoretical recommendations.\\nAlthough, in broad outline, the proposed system of defense may be thus briefly and accurately described, the governmental problems involved in transforming plans into actual accomplishment will be almost baffling in their intricacy and difficulty. Preliminary to undertaking actual development, necessary laws must be formulated and approved, and initial selections of higher military officials accomplished. Thereafter, and in full accord with the provisions of these legislative enactments, the professional and technical phases of the task will begin. Merely to name the more important of them is to indicate clearly the involved character of the project.\\nOrganization of the Department of National Defense must aim at efficient functioning, but must avoid extravagance entailed by the maintenance of unnecessary overhead. Its membership must possess the qualifications required by the purpose of each essential bureau, including those, for example, pertaining to armament, administration, supply, sanitation, and legal affairs.\\nAn efficient officer corps is the very soul of an army. To produce one of the requisite size and qualifications we must first provide for its gradual accumulation, so that future turn-over will involve only a small annual increment. We must evolve policies governing appointments, promotion, pay, assignment, and retirements, and must provide for the thorough military education of its members. Technical schools must be established, and for these the faculties must first be organized and thoroughly indoctrinated.\\nSuitable tactical organization of the Army, accurately adjusted to the necessities of Philippine conditions, must be developed. Applicable doctrine and method must be evolved. A skeletonized organization for registration of citizens subject to military training, and for receiving, caring for and training annual quotas must be established. Necessary programs pertaining to munitions, including such technical items as airplanes, rifles, cannon, machine guns, ammunition, signal equipment, bridging material, and a host of other matters must be formulated in accordance with our minimum needs. Inspection, accounting, and other phases of administration must be established and maintained. All these constitute immediate problems for which solutions must develop side by side, each fully articulated and synchronized with all others.\\nThis necessary control, direction, and coordination of a myriad of essential details represents one of the most difficult and critical problems of the entire project. In its importance to progress, it will, for some years to come, overshadow all others. For its successful solution there is immediately demanded, not only a technical ability that extends to every phase of the military profession, but also a broad and thorough experience in the field of higher administration, organization, and leadership. Unless these qualifications can be made constantly available to the Commonwealth we will pay for their lack in millions of squandered pesos, years of wasted time, and in confusion of effort and added risks to our nation’s security.\\nUnfortunately it is this type of ability and experience that, as yet, there has been little opportunity to develop among our own people. We have produced, both in the Constabulary and in the Philippine Scouts, officers of outstanding worth in particular lines of military endeavor, from among whom we confidently expect to obtain initially the senior officers of the new Army. But due to the conditions of our past existence we have had no War Department, no complete defense force, no balanced army, no exclusive responsibility for protection, and, consequently, no experience in the functions that now assume for us a transcendent importance.\\nIn this situation we have no alternative but to obtain this experience, this ability, and this skill from other sources, and in my anxiety on this score I earnestly considered all upon which we might logically depend.\\nEvery consideration of friendship and association supported the hope that this source might be the United States. Consequently, I presented to the President of that country the essentials of this problem and explained our dire need for help. More specifically I earnestly requested the detail of General Douglas MacArthur, then Chief of Staff of the United States Army, as the one soldier whose opinion on every question of military organization would command the respect of all our people. The President’s response was immediate, sympathetic, and definite.\\nAt a very real sacrifice to the American Army this officer, who since 1930 had served continuously as its Chief of Staff, has been made available to the Commonwealth Government as Military Adviser. His record in peace and war requires no eulogy from me. His qualifications for the important post in which he will serve are as clearly appreciated among our own people as they are in Washington. Because of this, and because also of his own known devotion to the Philippines and to the Filipino people, the wisdom of his choice will be universally recognized. I request authority to confer upon General MacArthur and his assistants the rank and emoluments that I deem in keeping with their important duties and the dignity of this nation.\\nThe several provisions of law fundamental to the development of Philippine defense are outlined in a draft of a bill which I shall presently furnish you. It depicts, in much greater detail than I have attempted here, the defense plan I propose for adoption. It represents the essence of the authorizations, directives, and general policies necessary to insure initiation of the project.\\nAgain, I emphasize the need for prompt and positive action in initiating this great project. In every other line of human endeavor we have built, not only the foundations, but also the framework and, in certain cases, even the edifice itself. But here, except for necessary law enforcement elements, not a stone has been laid.\\nThe refusal to grant us immediate and complete independence has been due, in large measure, to our present inability to cope with a general revolt or to offer any kind of resistance to an invading force. Your swift action on the defense measures I am proposing will prove the earnestness of our determination to be, and forever to remain, free and independent. What, I ask, would be the use of seeing our country free one day, with its own flag standing alone and flying against the sky, only to see ourselves the subjects of another power the following day, with its flag the sovereign in and of our country? What would be the purpose of educating our young men and women concerning their rights and privileges as free citizens, if tomorrow they are to be subjects of a foreign foe? Why build up the wealth of the Nation only to swell up the coffers of another? If that be our preordained fate, why seek a new master when the Stars and Stripes has given us not only justice and fair treatment, welfare and prosperity, but also ever increasing political liberties including independence?\\nNational freedom now stands before us as a shining light—the freedom that for many years gleamed only fitful candle in the distant dark. We shall make ourselves ready to grasp the torch, so that no predatory force may ever strike it from our hands!\\n  \n",







                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\nMessage\\nof\\nHis Excellency Manuel L. Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly\\nOn the Country’s conditions and problems\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the First Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on June 16, 1936]\\nMr. Speaker, Gentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nSeven months ago this Commonwealth was inaugurated amidst the general rejoicing of our people, and with misgivings on the part of some timorous individuals. Today the Government of the Commonwealth counts with the confidence and respect of all. True, there are still a few prophets of disaster, but these need not seriously disturb us, for it is evident that it is only their wish that is father to their forebodings.\\nOur Relations with America\\nUnder the provisions of the Independence Act incorporated into our Constitution, the Government of the United States retains direct control and supervision over our foreign affairs, as well as certain specific powers in a few cases of domestic character. These powers are vested in the President of the United States whose representative in the Islands is the United States High Commissioner. My personal and official relations with High Commissioner Frank Murphy have been most cordial, and the highest spirit of cooperation has characterized the transactions of our Government with the Washington Administration.\\nIt was with a deep sense of loss that our people saw High Commissioner Murphy depart for the United States and it is their hope that he will soon return to the Philippines.\\nThe Gold Reserve Funds and the Excise Tax on Oil\\nIt is with regret that I have to inform you that the Senate of the United States has passed a bill repealing the Act recognizing the equity of the Philippine Government on the sum of P47,000,000 arising from the devaluation of the dollar as a reimbursement for the depreciation of our reserves deposited in the United States. Were this bill to pass Congress, our Government would be made to incur a loss or that American officials have done contrary to the recommendation of Filipino representatives. I have not, however, given up the hope that the House of Representatives will not follow the action of the Senate, for I cannot conceive that America, which in this case acted as the guardian of Filipino interests, should want to profit from the losses of her ward. I know that High Commissioner Murphy has done and is doing everything he can to secure this fund for the Philippines.\\nAgain there are attempts to enact legislation reverting to the Treasury of the United States the proceeds of the excise tax on coconut oil imported from the Philippines. The amount of collections is now around P56,000,000 and is deposited in the United States Treasury. Payment to the Government of the Philippines in accordance with the law has been suspended in view of cases pending in the courts contesting the validity of the law. It is my earnest belief that Congress will not approve the proposed legislation above referred to. Heretofore, whenever the Congress of the United States has taxed goods or products imported into the United States from the Philippines, invariably it has provided the payment of all collections to our Government. It is, therefore, beyond my comprehension that at this stage of our relations with America that record of fair dealing and justice should be reversed. We are also counting upon the help of Commissioner Murphy and other friends in Congress to prevent the enactment of the said law.\\nOur Foreign Population\\nI am happy to be able to inform the Assembly that the foreign population of the Islands has, since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, shown a genuine desire to cooperate with our people to make this government a signal success.\\nMuch has been printed in the local and foreign papers regarding the ownership of large tracts of land by Japanese subjects in Davao. There is an impression that Davao is actually owned by the Japanese. Such is not the case.\\nThe total area owned, leased and/or cultivated by the Japanese in Davao is about 60,000 hectares out of almost two million hectares that constitute the total area of the public domain in that province. It is true that Japanese investments in Davao are considerable, and that there are doubts expressed as to the legality of some of the transactions entered into between Filipinos and Japanese regarding the public domain leased to Filipinos by the Government. In these cases the Government will act in accordance with law and equity. Before any course of action is finally decided upon by the Administration, I shall advise with the Assembly and take no step without your previous knowledge. There is nothing in the so-called Davao problem that should cause serious concern.\\nPeace and Order\\nThe country has never been entirely free from armed bandits or outlaws as it has been during the last four months. At the beginning of the present administration there were two armed bands which had been marauding in the Provinces of Laguna and Tayabas for some time, and there was at large one notorious bandit in the Province of Lanao who for many years had been terrorizing that district with murders and robberies. Two hours after my inauguration as Chief Executive I had a conference with the governors of Laguna and Tayabas and the Chief of Constabulary, and I instructed them to spare no effort in the capture or extermination of these outlaws. Soon thereafter the Lanao bandit having resisted arrest was killed by the Constabulary and within two months every members of the armed bands in Laguna and Tayabas had been either captured or killed. However, there is still the danger of possible sporadic public disturbances like the uprising of the Sakdalistas which took place a year ago last May. Professional demagogues who make their living by exploiting the patriotism of the uninformed or the real or fancied grievances of the discontented, are exciting the masses with incendiary speeches and literature. Communism has also been active during the last few years and while its propaganda has not been particularly effective the forces of law and order have to be constantly on guard. There is not, of course, the slightest danger of any general uprising, but we cannot allow any serious disturbance of the public order to take place. One of the few cases which may give occasion for American intervention is the failure of the Government to preserve order and to protect life, property, and individual liberty. The world is watching this experiment in Filipino self-government, and the confidence and respect which in the future the nations may have in the Philippine Republic will depend in large measure upon our ability to maintain peace and order and to extend effective protection to all the residents of the Islands during the transition period. Knowing as I do the great superiority of the forces of the Government over any misguided group that may be induced to armed revolt, it causes me anguish to think that under my administration the armed forces of the government may be compelled to take such drastic measure as would exact a greater toll of life than during the Sakdalista uprising. From every point of view, therefore, it is better that preventive measures be taken, and it is my earnest hope that the National Assembly will not delay the enactment of appropriate legislation to this end.\\nSocial Justice\\nWhile the Government cannot compromise with public disorder, it is equally its duty to right social injustices. That our laborers in the farm as well as in the factories still suffer from long-standing unfair practices, no one can successfully deny. These injustices, however, cannot be remedied by merely applying here legislation in force in other countries. For such legislation would not take into account local conditions, nor the incipient stage of our industrial life and the almost primitive state of our agriculture. Government administration is a practical question and statesmanship consists in the wise application of sound doctrines bearing in mind the actual conditions that have to be met with in each case. Even the most up-to-date progressive labor legislation, if not in keeping with the prevailing conditions here, may easily upset our existing industries, preventing the establishment of new ones, and retard the advance of our agriculture. I, therefore, advocate a policy of progressive conservatism based upon the recognition of the essential and fundamental rights of labor.\\nThe Philippine Legislature has in the past enacted several measures for the protection of labor, but while they have improved somewhat the lot of the workingman to the extent that the Filipino laborer enjoys more rights and privileges than his brother in other Oriental countries, it is necessary that we should go further and give better and more effective protection to the rights and interests of our wage-earners. I would, therefore, urge the enactment of a law authorizing the creation of boards of arbitration to settle questions of labor, minimum wages, working conditions, and other matters affecting their relations.\\nWith the passage of the Tenancy Law, it was believed that the relationship between the landowner and tenant could be maintained on a fair and satisfactory basis. Although the legislation has been in the statute book for several years, I do not know of a single locality which has put it into effect, as its enforcement in any province was made dependent on an affirmative resolution of the majority of the municipal councils of that province. There is now more discontent and social unrest among the farm laborers than among the industrial workers. I believe this situation will be materially improved by the enactment of the Arbitration Board Law to which I have referred.\\nThe large landed estates or “haciendas” offer a different problem. This administration, by the Coalition platform, is committed to the policy favoring the acquisition of these estates at a fair and just price, so they may be sold in small lots to the tenants. I regret to state that after a careful study of this question, I have reached the conclusion that such a step would not remedy the situation nor could it be carried out without exposing the country to great financial losses.\\nImmediately after assuming office, I instructed the Department of Labor and the Department of Agriculture and Commerce to give me the necessary information so that I might recommend to the National Assembly at this regular session the purchase of these landed estates or “haciendas” and their subsequent sale to the tenants. Both Secretaries of said Departments have personally investigated some of the outstanding controversies between some of the “haciendas” and their tenants, and I have also taken part in one of those investigations. I have likewise studied the effects of the purchase of the so-called friar lands.\\nIt is now my earnest conviction that the purchase of these “haciendas” by the Government will not solve the agrarian and social problems existing therein, but will only transfer to the Government the difficulties which the tenants now have with the present landowners.\\nThe friar lands were acquired by the Government for the purpose of reselling them in small parcels to the men who were working on these lands; but, for several causes, the result has been that a large area of these “haciendas” is now in the hands of other people. The lot of the former tillers of these lands has not in the least improved. The investment, therefore, of several millions of pesos by the Government in the purchase of the friar lands has only been, with few exceptions, for the benefit of people not contemplated by the Government. The latest report I have is that in this transaction the Government lost heavily. If the Philippine Government lost then when the price paid for the friar lands was relatively low, it is evident that now, that the price asked for these “haciendas” is very much higher, the Government is bound to suffer a greater loss. There might be some justification in exposing the country to this financial loss if, through such purchase, the majority of the people working on them were to become the owners of the land which they are now cultivating. I am positive, however, that such will not be the case, any more than it was in the case of the friar lands, and I, for one, despite the commitment in the Coalition platform, do not wish to impose upon our people the burden of a national debt which our children will have to bear merely to give a few individuals the opportunity to acquire these particular areas at the expense of the people when there is so much available fertile and untouched public land in many regions of our country, particularly in Mindanao.\\nI realize the difficulty of convincing the men and their families who are now living in these “haciendas” to move out from their places of birth in order to settle in other provinces or islands, knowing as I do the attachment of the Filipino to his hometown. We must encourage our people to have a national outlook so that they may feel at home in whatever corner of the Philippines they may find themselves. We thus have an opportunity to induce the settlement of our sparsely populated areas by the tenants of these “haciendas,” and the money that the Government would surely lose with their purchase could be invested to better advantage in the construction of roads and improvement of health conditions in said uninhabited but rich sections of the Philippines.\\nIn the meantime, I recommend the adoption of measures similar to those which were adopted in Ireland to solve agrarian problems there which have been existing from time immemorial. I also recommend the immediate passage of a law authorizing the expropriation of those portions of the large “haciendas” which are urban in character and are occupied by the houses of the tenants. With the opportunity to own their own homes thus assured, the settlement of the present difficulties of the tenants relative to their farm lands might no longer be of urgent necessity.\\nPrevious Legislative Enactments\\nIn your inaugural session, which lasted barely thirty days, you enacted the most important legislation pledged in the Coalition platform and urgently required by the nature of the new responsibilities of the present government. The record you have made has earned for you just commendation and constitutes the main reason for the prevailing confidence in our future. I now beg leave to report what has been done by Executive in compliance with your legislative enactments.\\nNational Defense –Conscious of the fact that the prime duty of every government is to provide for national defense, the first measure you have enacted is the “National Defense Act” (Commonwealth Act No. 1).\\nThis Act provides for the reorganization of a defensive system composed of the Regular Force and a trained citizen army, and contemplates a yearly appropriation of P16,000,000 for ten years, at the end of which the nation will be placed in a position of serene dignity amongst the powers of the world.\\nA comprehensive report of the steps taken in pursuance of the provisions of the National Defense Act has been submitted to be by the Military Adviser and it will be my pleasure to transmit it to you in a separate message. Suffice it for me to say now that the response of the country to the call of the Assembly has exceeded our fondest expectations. The number of Filipinos who enrolled on the date fixed for registration in accordance with the provisions of the National Defense Act was greatly in excess of what had been anticipated; in fact it was almost double our estimates. The school teachers who were given instructions in training camps to equip them with the knowledge necessary to carry out the work assigned to them in the schools under the provisions of the National Defense Act, conducted themselves so well and their training was so successful that they deserve from me a well-merited public recognition. It has been plainly demonstrated that our people are ready for the supreme sacrifice in defense of their motherland and their liberty.\\nI order to expedite the organization of the new Army, I made ad interim appointments to the positions of Chief and Deputy Chief of Staff, the Provost Marshal, and other high ranking officers. These appointments were made after a careful and impartial study of the record of every man and were made upon the recommendation of the Military Adviser of this Government.\\nNo one better than I knows how essential it is to entirely disassociate the Army from politics and, as scrupulously in the rank and file as in the high command, to make merit as the one and only basis of promotion. The Army is a double-edged sword. It is the arm of the Government which is the last resort for the enforcement of the laws and so compel obedience to constituted authority, for the maintenance of peace and order, and for the defense of the national integrity and liberty. But as contemporary history proves to us, the army can also be a disturber of peace and the enemy of law and established government, and in many instances it has been the instrument for the overthrow of constitutional regime. In building up our national defense, and in organizing the regular armed forces of the Islands, these tragic lessons of history must be constantly borne in mind, and it behooves us, who are for the time being entrusted with the responsibility of leadership over our nation, to be forever watchful and vigilant lest we sow the seeds of a possible future misuse of our armed forces. A just and fair treatment for the Army and its rank and file, the upholding of civil authority over the military, insistence upon strict discipline within the organization, non-interference by outsiders, political or otherwise, and a rigid prohibition against the use of the organization or its members for political purposes –these are the basic principles that must be faithfully adhered to in order to make the Philippine Army the safeguard of our liberties and constitutional government, as well as the bulwark of our national integrity and independence.\\nDuring the brief period that I have been at the head of the Government, I have inspected most of the garrisons of the Philippine Army and Constabulary. I know and have known for years many of the officers of the organization and have had intimate relations with the high command. The discipline, the gentlemanly conduct, the devotion to duty, the patriotism and courage of the officers and men make me feel proud as a Filipino and as the Commander-in-Chief of these armed forces of the Commonwealth.\\nThe National Economic Council –Another important legislation which you passed in your inaugural session is that which creates the National Economic Council to advise the Government on economic and financial questions, including the improvement and promotion of industries, diversification of crops and production, tariffs, taxation, and such other matters as may from time to time be submitted so its consideration by the President, and to formulate an economic program based on national independence.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of said Act, I have appointed the Secretary of Finance, the Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Philippine National Bank, the President of the National Development Company, the President of the Manila Railroad Company, Mr. Joaquin M. Elizalde, Hon. R.J. Fernandez, Mr. Wenceslao Trinidad, Mr. Vicente Madrigal, Hon. Francisco Varona, Mr. Ramon Soriano, Hon. Vicente Singson Encarnacion, Hon. Rafael R. Alunan and Dr. Manuel L. Roxas, as members of the National Economic Council and designated as Chairman thereof the Secretary of Finance. The Council was organized on February 14, 1936, and it commenced to function immediately thereafter.\\nAs may be expected, considering the complex and highly technical character of the task entrusted to it, the National Economic Council has not so far submitted to the Government any economic program, nor has the Government sought the advice of the Council except on one question: namely, the advisability of creating the National Rice and Corn Corporation for the purpose of bringing about the stabilization of the price of rice, the most important staple food of our people, by protecting equally the producer and the consumer, and also to serve as an agency of the Government to meet local or national emergencies in cases of shortage of rice. It should be stated in all candor that it was only after a long debate inspired by honest differences of opinion that the National Economic Council gave its approval to this venture. Despite certain doubts expressed by some members of the Council, however, I am confident that the National Rice and Corn Corporation will ultimately solve the rice problem, one of the most serious national problems which for years has been confronting our country and which demanded immediate attention on account of its very serious implications.\\nThe situation may be summarized as follows: The main food supply of the Filipinos, like that of most Orientals, is rice. For many years the country did not produce a sufficient quantity of rice for its consumption and the Government deemed it necessary even to borrow money for the purpose of establishing irrigation systems in order that the country may be self-sufficient in rice supply. Our yearly importation of this article amounted to many millions of pesos, reaching over P25,000,000 in one year. During the last two years we were able to produce practically all the rice needed for our consumption. But no sooner did we reach this stage than the price of rice went down, in fact so low that the rice farmer not only made no profit, but actually suffered considerable losses. As a consequence, there has been a growing discontent on the part of the rice growers, especially the tenants or kasamas , who are earning less than is required for the bare necessities of life. On the other hand, whenever, due to typhoons, drought, or floods there was a shortage of rice and prices reached high levels, either through the manipulations of a few conscienceless rice merchants or merely because of scarcity of supply, the consumer, especially the poor, became a victim of speculatory activities. To save them the Government had to intervene and take drastic measures at times in order to alleviate the crisis.\\nIn spite of such a situation nothing has been attempted so far to remedy it, and this Administration felt that it was its duty, especially in view of the shortage of the last crop due to repeated typhoons and floods, to face the issue immediately and strive to solve the problem once and for all.\\nIt is only natural that there should be some doubt or fear, and even resentment from some quarters, over the action of the Government; hence criticisms are being made in public and in private, and those who expected to make unreasonable profits from the rice crisis and were foiled in their anticipations, went so far as to see dishonest purposes in the creation of the Rice and Corn Corporation. All such doubts and criticisms, whether honest or malicious, did not deter the Administration from carrying out the plan that has been adopted, especially because no alternative had been suggested.\\nTo meet the national emergency caused by the shortage of rice, I have designated the National Rice and Corn Corpation to act as the relief agency for the Government in place of the Bureau of Commerce which was in charge of this activity in the past. When the corporation started importing rice, the Collector of Customs, believing that the rice so imported must pay duties in view of the fact that it was being sold at some profit, informed the Secretary of Finance of his intention to collect such duties, and in fact did demand payment thereof by the Rice and Corn Corporation. After securing the legal opinion of the Secretary of Justice, I advised the Collector of Customs to desist from collecting any duties from the Rice and Corn Corporation on the rice imported so long as it was acting as the agent of the Government in meeting the emergency resulting from the rice shortage.\\nHeretofore, Government agencies disagreeing on the interpretation of the laws affecting their powers and rights, have been allowed to bring the case before the courts for adjudication. Such a policy, I think, is wrong, and in fact in one instance it has merited the criticism of our own Supreme Court. It makes both government agencies incur in unjustified expense and unnecessarily take up the time of the courts. Considered in its practical aspect, it only means taking money from one agency of the Government and giving it to another. If it had been a question of the Government on the one hand as against a purely private enterprise on the other, then it would have been not only proper but also necessary for the courts to have intervened.\\nThe Court of Appeals –Commonwealth Act No. 3, enacted also during the inaugural session of the Assembly, created the Court of Appeals in order to expedite and improve the administration of justice.\\nIn accordance with the provisions of said Act, I appointed the members of the Court who forthwith proceeded with its organization. These appointments were made after full information and careful consideration, with an eye single to the best interests of the administration of justice.\\nAs soon as funds are available for the purpose, I shall recommend to the Assembly that the necessary appropriation be made for the creation of another division of the Court of Appeals to sit in one of the southern provinces and to authorize the various divisions of the Court of Appeals to sit in any of the provinces within their jurisdiction, to hear cases pending before the Court for decision. Such procedure would not only expedite but would also greatly reduce the cost of appeals to litigants, thus making this appellate Court more accessible to the poor.\\nManila Railroad Company –A very important measure approved by the National Assembly is Commonwealth Act No. 4 providing funds to be loaned to the Manila Railroad Company for the purchase, before maturity, of certain outstanding bonds of the said Company. In accordance with the provisions of this Act, I directed the Insular Treasurer to loan to the Manila Railroad Company P9,900,000, and authorized the Philippine National Bank to use P3,360,000 of its funds in the purchase of said bonds.\\nOn January 29, 1936, upon payment to the Manila Railway Company (1906) Ltd., through the Chase National Bank, New York City, of the sum of $6,698,631.41 covering the principal, interest and exchange premium, all of the Souther Lines 4 per cent gold bonds maturing May 1, 1939, held by the English Company, with par value of P16,340,000, were delivered to the order of the Bureau of Insular Affairs, Washington, D.C., acting as representative of the Commonwealth Government and the Manila Railroad Company.\\nThe successful culmination of this exceedingly important transaction resulted in great financial advantages to the direct benefit of the Manila Railroad Company and indirectly of the Commonwealth Government, which is the sole owner of the property. The following estimates indicate in round figures the savings that will be effected between now and the maturity of the bonds:\\n\\n\\n\\nTotal face value of the bonds held by the Manila Railway Company (1906), Ltd.\\n……………..\\nP16,340,000.00\\n\\n\\nCost at 80 per cent of face value\\n……………..\\n13,072,000.00\\n\\n\\nSavings in principal\\n……………..\\n3,268,000.00\\n\\n\\nLess –premium\\n……………..\\n165,500.00\\n\\n\\nNet saving in principal\\n……………..\\n3,102,500.00\\n\\n\\nNormal 4 per cent annual interest on English Company holdings\\nP653,600.00\\n\\n\\n\\nNormal interest for 1936, 1937, 1938 and half of 1939\\n2,287,600.00\\n\\n\\n\\nPremium for 3-1/2 years at P441,180 each year\\n1,544,130.00——————\\n3,831,730.00—————————–\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n……………..\\nP6,934,230.00\\n\\n\\nLess-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2% on P13,350,000 for 3-1/2 years\\n\\n934,500.00—————————–\\n\\n\\nTotal savings in principal and interest\\n……………..\\nP5,999,730.00================\\n\\n\\n\\nThe above savings on the English Company holdings are based on the principal of the bonds being redeemed at maturity at their face value. However, both the principal and interest are subject, at the holders’ option, to payment in certain European currencies at the former gold equivalent, and if this option should be exercised covering the principal at the time of maturity, the amount necessary to redeem the bonds being held by the English Company would, on the present basis of exchange, represent a total sum of approximately P27,287,800. The purchase of these new bonds at this time for the sum of P13,072,000, therefore, means a saving in interest and principal of about P14,200,000 besides a savings in interest and premium amounting to about P2,900,000 after allowing for the two per cent interest on the loan from the Government, or a total saving of about P17,100,000.\\nThe investment of the Government in the Manila Railroad Company including bonded indebtedness of the Company all told amounts to approximately P28,000,000. This is a respectable sum for any Government and doubly so for a Government whose yearly revenue at present is around P78,000,000 and at its highest peak only reached the total of P92,783,173.70.\\nBus and truck transportation due to improved roads in the northern and central provinces of Luzon have caused a large decline in the income of the Manila Railroad Company. We cannot afford to allow this situation to continue and permit the Government to suffer tremendous losses in railroad operation, for the time might come when the Government would either be compelled to suspend the operation of the Railway or carry a yearly financial burden that sooner or later would bankrupt the National Treasury.\\nThe Manila Railroad was acquired by the Insular Government in 1917 in order partly to withdraw from foreign hands the control of our most important means of transportation at that time. Soon after the Government assumed the administration of this property, the railroad began paying interest on the bonds from its revenue, and even extended some of its lines with its own resources. Only during the last two or three years has the income of the railroad begun to decline due, as already stated, to bus and truck competition. If it should be found advisable, I am prepared to authorize the Manila Railroad Company to purchase some of these competing bus transportation companies or else to have the Government establish and operate its own bus and truck services. The Constitution expressly authorizes the Government to establish and operate means of transportation and communication, and, upon payment of just compensation, transfer to public ownership utilities held by private individuals to be operated by the Government.\\nAnother step that must be taken at once is the completion of the railroad line to the Bicol provinces. This, I am informed, will make the southern lines a paying enterprise. In pursuance of the authority vested in me by law, I have directed the Secretary of Finance to purchase P3,000,000 worth of stocks of the Manila Railroad to finance the completion of the Aloneros-Ragay line. It is my understanding that to complete the road the Government will have to invest only P700,000 more in addition to the P3,000,000 referred to above.\\nBut this amount will have to be greatly increased if the Manila Railroad Company is not given permission to abandon the Legaspi-Tabaco, Las Pinas-Naic, Rosario-Montalban and Batangas-Bauan lines which are absolutely unnecessary from the point of view of public convenience and which, consequently, are causing an annual loss of about P100,000 to the Railroad Company. Once these lines are abandoned their materials and equipment will be used in the construction of the Aloneros-Ragay line.\\nI, therefore, earnestly recommend that a law be enacted authorizing the Manila Railroad Company to abandon the lines above mentioned.\\nGovernment Survey Board –In accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 5, I appointed Hon. Miguel Unson, as Chairman, and Mr. Wenceslao Trinidad and Mr. Jose Paez, as members of the Government Survey Board on February 14, 1936. The Board has been devoting considerable time to the investigation of the Government bureaus and their activities and to the formulation of a plan whereby the Government may be simplified and made more economical as well as more efficient. The most important recommendation of this Board is the creation of the Budget Office, which I have approved, and in accordance therewith I have appointed the Auditor General and the Director of Civil Service, as members of the Commission and the Honorable Serafin Marabut, former Chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the National Assembly, as Undersecretary of Finance and Director of the Budget. The budget which I will soon submit to the Assembly has already been prepared by the Commission and approved by the Cabinet. The only other case in which I have exercised the authority granted me by Commonwealth Act No. 5, also upon the recommendation of the Survey Board, is the transfer of the coastguard and lighthouse service from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce to the Bureau of Customs.\\nAt this time the Board is conducting a careful investigation and study of the activities of the Bureau of Lands, General Land Registration Office, Bureaus of Public Works, Science, Animal Industry, Plant Industry and Health, and of the University of the Philippines, with the end in view of avoiding duplication and simplifying procedure. Special attention is being given by the Board to the matter of cadastral surveys, homesteads, a general registration office, a central statistics office, and proper allocation on centralization of laboratories with the purpose of recommending the intensification of industrial researches, so essential to the economic development of our country. Preliminary survey of the provincial and municipal services is likewise under way.\\nPhilippine National Bank –In accordance with the provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 6, the Philippine National Bank has written up certain assets, heretofore considered as losses, at their actual value. On January 17, 1936, the sum of P3,940,000 was thus written up and paid to the Government, and on May 18, 1936, the sum of P2,944,997 was also written up to be paid to the Government in due course.\\nNational Loan and Investment Board –The National Loan and Investment Board created by Commonwealth Act No. 7 has been constituted by the appointment of Mr. Salvador Lagdameo, as chairman, and of Dr. Luther B. Bewley, Mr. Jose Bernardo, and Mr. Pedro M. Moncayo, as members.\\nThe Board began functioning on February 29, 1936, by adopting measures to organize its office and at the same time granting loans from the different funds placed under its control and administration. Due to the natural delay encountered in making the delimitation of the powers of the National Loan and Investment Board and those of the different boards and offices originally controlling the several investible funds transferred to the former, as well as in transferring the personnel and appointing the necessary new employees, the Board has not as yet been able to completely organize its office and to function as properly as it should. The amount of investible funds, the investment of which has been placed under the administration of the National Loan and Investment Board, aggregates P45,000,000 as of December 31, 1935. The actual transfer of these funds to the National Loan and Investment Board has not yet been completed. It is, however, hoped that such transfer will soon be effected.\\nIt has been found that certain amendments to Commonwealth Act No. 7 are immediately needed in order to clarify some of its provisions.\\nConstruction of Roads in Mindanao –In the exercise of the powers vested in me by Commonwealth Act No. 18, I authorized the expenditure of P820,000 for the completion of the road connecting the Provinces of Lanao, Cotabato and Davao on the Island of Mindanao. As an initial step in the program of giving new impetus to the development of Mindanao, this work will be of incalculable value to the country, since it will not only provide an overland outlet for Davao but will also open to settlement immense unoccupied areas of that island.\\nThe time has come when we should systematically proceed with and bring about the colonization and economic development of Mindanao. A vast and rich territory with its untapped natural resources is a temptation to enterprising nations that are looking for an outlet for their excess population. While no nation has the right to violate the territorial integrity of another nation, people that lack the energy, ability, or desire to make use of the resources which Divine Providence has placed in their hands, afford an excuse for a more energetic and willful people to deprive them of their lawful heritage. If, therefore, we are resolved to conserve Mindanao for ourselves and our posterity, we must bend all our efforts to occupy and develop it and guard against avarice and greed. Its colonization and development will require no little capital. But every cent spent for this purpose will mean increased national wealth and greater national security. The present income of the government is quite insufficient to even attempt to do more than carry on its present activities. Were there no other reasons for the creation of new sources of revenue, the need of developing Mindanao alone would make it an unavoidable duty for this Assembly, especially those who visited Mindanao recently with me, are conscious, I feel sure, of our grave responsibility to encourage settlement and develop Mindanao. There are provinces in Luzon and the Visayas that are already overpopulated. There are localities in some of those provinces where the people live on large estates without opportunity to earn a livelihood sufficient to meet the necessities of civilized life, much less to own the land wherein they live and which they cultivate. It is inconceivable that such a situation should exist in a country with extensive areas of fertile uncultivated lands. I invite you, therefore, to give this matter preferential consideration.\\nThe so-called Moro problem is a thing of the past. We are giving our Mohammedan brethren the best government they have ever had and we are showing them our devoted interest in their welfare and advancement. In turn they are giving us their full cooperation. Let us reserve for them in their respective localities such land of the public domain as they may need for their well-being. Let us, at the same time, place in the unoccupied lands of that region industrious Filipinos from other provinces of the Archipelago, so that they may live together in perfect harmony and brotherhood.\\nPublic Instruction\\nIn order to comply with the provisions of the Constitution concerning public education I feel it my duty to see to it that a careful study be made of the fundamental problems brought about by the conditions now obtaining so that our educational policies and objectives may be re-defined. Our system of public education must be inspired in Filipino patriotism and consecrated to the formation of citizens of high moral character and civic virtues. It must equip our citizens with social and vocational efficiency not only for their own benefit but also so that they may the better serve the State. We must provide every child of school age the opportunity to receive primary instruction.\\nSo that the Government may be advised as to the best method and the necessary means to carry out the reorganization and proper orientation of our public school system, I have created, by executive order, the Council of Education, composed of professional educators drawn from our own Bureau of Education and the Government University as well as from some of the best accredited private institutions of learning. Dr. Rafael Palma, former President of the University of the Philippines, is at the head of the Council. The members are: Hon. Gabriel Manalac, Dr. Francisco Benitez, Dr. Jorge Bocobo, Dr. Luther Bewley, Hon. Norberto Romualdez, Mrs. Sofia R. de Veyra, Dr. Mariano V. de los Santos, Dr. Nicanor Reyes, Dr. Manuel L. Carreon, and Mr. Segundo Infantado. I hope that during the present sessions some recommendations of the Council may be submitted to you for appropriate action.\\nCivil Service\\nDuring the last especial session I recommended the enactment of legislation that will make our Civil Service Law conform to the provisions of the Constitution. Lack of time prevented you from taking affirmative action on this subject, and I hereby renew my former recommendation.\\nThe National Language\\nWhile it is my hope and conviction that the English language will remain one of the most generally spoken languages in the Philippines even after independence, nevertheless, we cannot ignore the injunction of the Constitution that we take steps for the formation of a national language based on one of the existing native languages. It is difficult to determine what practical measures may be adopted at this time to bring this about, but I wish to lay the problem before you so that you may give it your early and deliberate consideration. Perhaps a committee may be created to study the question and make recommendations.\\nNew Taxes\\nIn view of the new and greater responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the necessity of having at our disposal funds with which to carry out a comprehensive program for the economic development of the country, it will be necessary to create new taxes. The following are some of the tax measures which I recommend for your approval:\\n1.   The amendment of the Income Tax Law by reducing the personal tax exemption and increasing the rate of the tax on excess personal income and of the tax on corporate profits.\\n2.   The amendment of the Inheritance Tax Law by increasing the rate of the tax, particularly in the case of estates of decedents not leaving any forced heirs.\\n3.   The increase of the tax on mines.\\n4.   Taxes on luxuries and amusements.\\n5.   The creation of a school tax in an amount equal to the present cedula tax, which should be abolished.\\n6.   A tax on transportation and travel in an amount sufficient to take care of the maintenance and improvement of roads.\\n7.   A modification of the Land Tax Law, so as to provide for a progressively increasing rate of taxation based upon the area of the landholdings.\\n8.   Modifications of present tax laws to enable the Government to collect taxes more effectively.\\nThe taxes I am recommending place the burden upon shoulders that can well afford to bear them and, if levied, the Commonwealth Government will be able to render our people new services so urgently needed for their welfare and progress. I feel confident that those who are called upon to pay these taxes will not grudge their added contribution to the public weal.\\nUntil the National Assembly enacts the measure above referred to, it will be futile for me to present for your consideration a program of government activities or industrial development which the Government may initiate or help in part, for there will be no means with which to carry it out.\\nConclusion\\nFrom time to time, during your present session, I shall have occasion to present for your study and consideration matters that, in my opinion, deserve your attention. Meanwhile, may I express the hope that the cordial cooperation which as existed in the last session between the Executive and the Legislative Departments will continue to be keynote of our relations? The success of the Commonwealth will depend upon the ability of the executive and legislative departments to cooperate with each other.\\nIn our day and generation democracy, as an effective system of government, is being challenged. Let this new democracy of ours show to the world that democracy can be as efficient as a dictatorship, without trespassing upon individual liberty and the sacred rights of the people.\\n  \n",



Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly\\nOn Improvement of Philippine Conditions, Philippine Independence and Relations with American High Commissioner\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the Second Session of the National Assembly, in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on October 18, 1937]\\nMr. Speaker, Gentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nAt no time in ancient or contemporary history has Almighty God showered His blessings upon our beloved country as generously as He has done during this year that is about to close. In a spirit of humility and thankfulness to Him, I come to report to you that the finances of the Government are sounder than they have ever been, that our foreign and internal trade has increased, that more school houses and roads have been built and opened to the people, that public health is in good condition, and that peace and order prevail in every province, city, municipality, and barrio of the Archipelago.\\nIn this year too, as the highest representative of our people, I have taken a step that is of the greatest moment to the Fatherland. In my recent trip abroad I proposed to the President of the United States that he recommend to the Congress the granting of complete independence to the Philippines either on the 30th of December 1938, or the 4th of July, 1939.\\nI feel certain that in making this petition I have expressed the views of the immense majority of our people and that it is better for us to be independent now, that is to say, as soon as the necessary steps could be taken for the orderly process of erecting an independent Republic, rather than in 1946.\\nI can see no valid reason why, if the Philippines can be given independence in 1946, she may not have it in 1938 or 1939. In the short span of seven years the Filipino people can hardly do anything that would substantially change their present situation. Any obstacle which would vitally affect the chances of a successful and lasting independent nationhood in 1939 cannot be overcome by 1946.\\nSo, if we want independence at any cost and are ready to take all the consequences –the dangers as well as the advantages of independent national existence- let us have it no later than 1939. If, however, we are fearful of the possible threats that complete independence may offer to our national security, and we would rather remain under the protecting wing of the United States, then let us leave the final determination of our future to come coming generations and not deceive ourselves with the groundless hope that by 1946 we shall have become politically and economically beyond any serious difficulty.\\nWe cannot be hesitating indefinitely. The best interest, indeed the very life, of the nation is at stake. If it is our resolve to be an independent nation, this is the time, for every year lost is to our evident disadvantage.\\nOur duty –the duty of the Executive and Legislative branches of the government- is plain. Under the Independence Act and the Constitution, the Government of the Commonwealth has been established to prepare the country for complete independence. Our people alone, by their own choice and direction, can command us to take a different course.\\nSince the news of my proposal to have the transition period shortened was published, voices in opposition to it have been heard both in public and in private. Let me say in all earnestness to those Filipinos who believe in good faith that the security, liberty, prosperity, and peace of our common country lie in some kind of political partnership with the United States rather than in complete independence, that they should say so frankly and come out courageously in the open with an alternative plan, instead of merely adopting dilatory tactics in the belief that when the fourth of July, 1946, shall have arrived, some unforeseen event will prevent the establishment of the Philippine Republic. They have nothing to fear: there is here freedom of thought and of speech, and one may be as much a patriot advocating some other political status for the Philippines as favoring complete independence so long as in advocating he is inspired not by selfish motives but by what he honestly believes is for the commonweal. As long as the essentials of freedom are not sacrificed –and they must not be sacrified under any consideration- the formula for securing and enjoying it may well be debated upon.\\nIt is true that from the point of view of a foreigner who does not intend to remain in the Philippines after independence shall have been granted and who is contemplating to liquidate his interests in this country, the remaining seven years may, perhaps, give him the opportunity to withdraw his investments. But, is this a sufficient reason to postpone the grant of independence if, on the other hand, it would be to the best permanent interests of the Filipino people to accelerate its grant? Is the future well-being of a whole nation to be sacrificed for the benefit of a few foreigners? Do these foreigners have any right to a special consideration?\\nFrom the very first day of America’s occupation of the Philippines, she disclaimed any intention to permanently hold these Islands. Neither did she, in thus announcing to the whole world her intentions, ever give any promise either directly or by implication that she would not withdraw her sovereignty from her newly-occupied territory at a moment’s notice. Therefore, foreigners who had investments in the Philippines when the United States took possession of the Islands, as well as those who came thereafter, knew full well that they were not placing themselves under the protection of the American flag except for as long a time only, and no longer, as the Government of the United States decided to retain the Philippines.\\nWith more reason should these foreigners have known that the days of American sovereignty were numbered when, in 1916, the Jones Law was enacted, for it was solemnly and clearly declared in that law that the Philippines would be granted her independence as soon as a stable government could be established in this country. Since the question of the stability of a government is a matter of opinion, and in the case of the Government of the Philippines, the Congress alone has the right to determine the question, that pronouncement in the Jones Law was tantamount to a formal notice to all concerned that the United States might, at any time, leave the Islands to their own fate.\\nIt is true that when the Independence Act was approved by the Congress in 1934, it was specifically provided therein that complete independence would be granted ten years following the inauguration of the Government of the Commonwealth; but the reports of the respective Committees and the speeches delivered upon the floor of both Houses of the Congress clearly show this was not a commitment addressed to foreigners having investments in the Philippines, but only to the Filipino people who, in the opinion of the Congress, might be seriously injured economically if their trade relations with the United States were abruptly terminated. If the Filipino people themselves are willing to have the date for the granting of independence advanced, there is nothing, expressed or implied, in the Independence Law that denies them the right to ask the Congress to shorten the transition period.\\nMy main reason for asking that the independence of the Philippines be granted not later than the 4th of July, 1939, is that I am sincerely of the opinion that it will be to our best interests to secure independence during and under the administration of President Roosevelt. I know the President, his progressive and liberal ideas, his very deep sense of justice, and his friendship for and good will towards the Filipino people. I have no doubt that under his leadership we will receive from the Government of the United States the fairest treatment that we may ever expect to receive under the leadership of his successors. And if the Philippines were to become independent not later than the fourth of July, 1939, President Roosevelt would still have more than one full year to extend his helping hand to the new Philippine Republic in the early stages of its dealings as an independent nation both with the United States and the rest of the world. We could, indeed, find no better sponsor than President Roosevelt to usher the Philippines into the family of free nations.\\nMoreover, the experience of the last two years has shown that, although the avowed purpose of the ten-year transition period is to stabilize the trade relations between the United States and the Philippines, as provided in the Independence Act, so as to give the Filipino people a basis for making readjustments in their national economy preparatory to the change that complete independence would bring with it, there were tendencies in Congress to disregard the terms and conditions governing said trade relations even against the will of the Filipino people.\\nIn proposing to President Roosevelt that he recommend to the Congress the shortening of the period for the grant of independence, I also asked that the present trade relations between the United States and the Philippines be continued for at least ten years after independence. If this were done and made a part of a treaty between the Government of the United States and the Philippine Republic the trade relations between the two countries would have been placed on a stable basis during the life of the treaty.\\nI know that there are people who believe that these trade relations only benefit the Philippines at the expense of the American people. As far as I am concerned, I would never ask from the United States anything that we could not reciprocate in kind. If U advocate the temporary continuance of the present trade relations between America and the Philippines it is because I am convinced that these trade relations are mutually beneficial to both countries.\\nThere is another vital reason why the date for the granting of independence should be advanced. The present political set-up is untenable in that while America retains her sovereign authority over the Philippines, she, at the same time, has placed in the hands of the Filipino people the responsibility for laying down the foundations and erecting the structure of the Philippine Republic. The continuation of her sovereignty over the Philippines imposes upon America obligations she cannot shirk, and, correspondingly, it gives her rights that are incompatible with the free exercise of our judgment as to the best means that we should adopt to prepare ourselves for an independent national existence. Conflicts of views, and perhaps of interests, may arise during the coming next eight years that may create misunderstanding and ill-feelings between the American and Filipino peoples and mar the unprecedented record of perfect cooperation and goodwill between two dissimilar races which Fate has thrown together temporarily. As long as America was the sovereign authority and reserved for herself and exercised full power over, and assumed exclusive responsibility for, the Government of the Philippines, there was no occasion for conflict. Her word was then final in all matters of public policy, and our duty was merely to cooperate with her, as we did cooperate under her authority and direction.\\nUpon the establishment of the Government of the Commonwealth, however, the situation has changed materially. By an Act of Congress, we were given power to create our own government, controlled and managed by us, under a Constitution of our own making. It was the plain purpose of the Congressional enactment that the Filipino people, who were to become automatically independent in 1946, would, during the Commonwealth period, take such steps, as in their opinion would best ensure the stability and success of the Philippine Republic. Yet, the powers granted to the Government of the Commonwealth in the most important and essential functions of government, such as those affecting trarrif, currency, finance, immigration, or those which in any way might involve the international obligations of the United States, etc., were subject to the ultimate approval of, or revocation by, the President of the United States.\\nIt must be recognized, on the one hand, that America cannot, in fairness to herself, concede more governmental powers to the Commonwealth than she has granted without endangering her own interest and peace, nor on the other hand, can the Filipino people assume responsibility for their due preparation for independence with only such limited powers as have been vested in the Commonwealth Government. In this predicament, it were better for America and the Philippines to be independent of each other so that each may be free to act in the furtherance of her own national objectives and interests.\\nWe have been fortunate indeed that so far the representatives of the President of the United States in the Philippines have been men of the highest character and integrity, of broad statesmanship, and of a clear vision of the task entrusted to them. You all know former High Commissioner Frank Murphy. His relations with us, not only as High Commissioner but also as Governor-General, have been very close and most cordial. In both capacities he has rendered permanent service to our people. In my last trip to America he has proven to me that his interest in our liberty and well-being is abiding.\\nThe present United States High Commissioner has been but a few months in our midst. Some of his early acts were misrepresented or misunderstood. For a time there were some misgivings on the part of our people as to his attitude towards them and this Government. But nothing can dispel misunderstandings quicker than personal contact.\\nIt is my pleasure and my duty to report to you –and what I am going to say is no mere gesture of official courtesy, but an honest and straight talk- that I could wish for no better United States High Commissioner in the Philippines than His Excellency, Paul V. McNutt. He measures up to his exalted position, both as an official and as a man. Indeed, it is a very difficult choice to make between Mr. McNutt, the man, and His Excellency, the High Commissioner.\\nSince my return, we have had some difficult problems to settle and I had occasion to appraise the true measure of him who now represents the President of the United States in the Philippines. He deserves our respect and affection. The best spirit of mutual cooperation characterizes our official association, and we have also become good friends. I feel confident that in serving his government and his country, High Commissioner McNutt will be of invaluable help to the Filipino people.\\nHappy and fruitful as our association with the American High Commissioner has been, I must state in all candor that these two short years of the life of the Commonwealth have already revealed some signs of the possibility of a serious conflict between the High Commissioner and the President of the Philippines in the performance of their respective duties even if each were desirous of avoiding such conflict. Perhaps there will always be found a way to arrive at some reasonable compromise as long as President Roosevelt is at the head of the American Government, and if his representative in our country were of the caliber of the two High Commissioners we have had until now; especially if the President of the Philippines understood American psychology and realized America’s difficult situation during this twilight period of our nationhood. But who can foretell what will happen if another President should be in the White House, or a less sympathetic man should represent the President of the United States in the Philippines, or a Filipino President should be one entirely foreign to American ways or one-sided in his views of American-Filipino relations? The only sure remedy to this dangerous situation is to terminate it with the least possible delay.\\nNo better evidence could have been given by President Roosevelt of his deep concern for the future welfare of our people than by the appointment of the Joint Preparatory Committee which is now sitting in conference in our country.\\nThe following statement given out jointly by Mr. Sayre, Assistant Secretary of State, as Chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Affairs, and myself on March 18, 1937, gives a complete idea of the reason for, and the object of, the creation of this Committee:\\n“Arrangements are being made for the appointment shortly of a joint preparatory committee of American and Philippine experts. The committee is to study trade relations between the United States and the Philippines and to recommend a program for the adjustment of Philippine national economy. This announcement followed conferences between President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth and the Inter-Departmental Committee on Philippine Affairs, which is acting on behalf of President Roosevelt in the preliminary discussions. Assistant Secretary of State Francis B. Sayre is Chairman of this Committee.\\n“Inasmuch as the Independence Act provides that complete political independence of the Philippines shall become effective on July 4, 1946, and inasmuch as President Quezon has suggested that the date of independence might be advanced to 1938 or 1939, it was agreed that the joint committee of experts would be expected in making its recommendations to consider the bearing which an advancement in the date of independence would have on facilitating or retarding the execution of a program of economic adjustment in the Philippines. It was further agreed that the preferential trade relations between the United States and the Philippines are to be terminated at the earliest practicable date consistent with affording the Philippines a reasonable opportunity to adjust their national economy. Thereafter, it is contemplated that trade relations between the two countries will be regulated in accordance with a reciprocal trade agreement on a non-preferential basis.”\\nThe members of the Joint Committee appointed by the Inter-Departmental Committee with the approval of President Roosevelt and by me are the following:\\nHis Excellency, the United States Ambassador to Turkey, Hon. John Van A. MacMurray, Chairman of the Committee.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Group\\nPhilippine Group\\n\\n\\nJoseph E.

The Philippines has undoubtedly made great strides both in the field of politics and of economics during the last three decades. Politically, we have reached the point where we are –having an almost entirely autonomous government and the assurance of complete independence. Economically, we have become an important factor in American commerce; our foreign and domestic trade has multiplied –in a word, the national wealth has greatly increased. We have accomplished, too, considerable progress in sanitation, in education, in the construction of roads and all kinds of communications, and we have acquired the modern conveniences of life. But the main beneficiaries of this most remarkable progress are the rich and the middle class. The rich can live in extravagant luxury. Some of their offspring grow up in an atmosphere of ease, with an outlook on life which gives paramount important to society affairs, vanities, trivialities and material possessions, devoid of discipline, love for work or human sympathy. The middle class have attained a higher standard of living as compared with that prevailing during the Spanish regime. The comforts of present-day civilization are within their reach and they are enjoying them. Their sons and daughters are better-fed, better clothed, better educated –thousands upon thousands of them are now receiving the benefits of higher instruction.\\nSad to tell, but it is none the less true, the same cannot be said of our laboring population. The men and women who till the soil or work in the factories are hardly better off now than they were during the Spanish regime. Of course, wages are higher than in any other Oriental country, with the possible exception of Japan. But it should be remembered that money could buy more in those Spanish days than it can now; and furthermore in the relationship between employer and employee in the days of old there was a consideration of higher value to the employee than the monetary compensation itself. Of yore employers and employees lived in personal contact and association resembling that which exists amongst members of the same family so that ties of affection bound them together much more than material considerations. Now this no longer obtains for their relationship is almost as impersonal and detached as that existing between employers and employees in highly industrialized countries. Again, our ancestors, because of their greater ignorance, knew no better and were resigned to their hard life, believing that it was a part of the world order as decreed by Divine Will, so that the unfortunate sufferer may meet with a greater reward in Heaven.\\nNow the Filipino workingman, however illiterate, refuses to believe that the Creator of the Universe could have ordained that some of His creatures should live in luxury and plenty, while others, in destitution and misery. The Filipino laborer now knows that the Father of mankind loves him as much as every other human being, and, therefore, that the world has not been made for the benefit of a few, but for the happiness of all.\\nStill more: The Filipino workingman has heard, if he is not able to read, of the equality before the law of the poor and the rich. He has heard of democracy, liberty, and justice, since every candidate for an elective office discourses on these topics, painting to him in glowing terms the meaning of these words.\\nAnd yet, what does he actually see? How do these doctrines that he has heard propounded from the platforms affect his everyday life? His hopes have been raised, his vision has been broadened, and his outlook has been painted in bright colors. But thirty-five years of American regime has brought him only disappointments and, sometimes, despair.\\nHas the progress then made by the Philippines benefited our poorer population? Rhe poor still has to drink the same polluted water that his ancestors drank for ages. Malaria, dysentery, and tuberculosis still threaten him and his family at every turn. His children cannot all go to school, or if they do, they cannot even finish the whole primary instruction for one reason or another.\\nRoads from his barrio or his little farm to the town there are none. Only trails are within his reach –trails that have been formed by the daily pressure of his bare feet and not because they have been constructed. As he works from sunrise to sundown, his employer gets richer while he remains poor. He is the easy prey of the heartless usurer because usury is still rampant everywhere despite legislative enactments intended to suppress it.\\nThat is, concisely speaking, the lot of the common man in our midst, after America’s long endeavor to give to all fair opportunity in the pursuit of happiness and the enjoyment of life.\\nIt was, of course, impossible for American administrators to see and reach the lowest strata of our population. But now that the reins of government are in our hands in so far as our own domestic affairs are concerned, what excuse, what reasonable justification can there be in allowing such a social and economic order to continue?\\nIt is high time that all the branches of this Government cooperate with one another, and with them the whole community and every good-hearted man and woman, so that at last in this dear land of ours social justice –real justice- in the relations of man to man, may reign supreme.\\nOur people are patient and law-abiding. They love peace. They have not lost their faith either in the executive, the legislative, or the judicial branch of the Government. As the Government is now in the hands of their own countrymen, they have become hopeful and are placing the realization of their dream for a better day in our clearer understanding of their lot, our better knowledge of conditions prevailing in the country, and in what should be the natural craving of our hearts to serve them with all the power at our command –they who are flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood.\\nThe promotion of social justice by the State is a clear and categorical mandate of our Constitution. Our platform, the platform upon which you and I have been elected, imposes upon us the high duty of enacting measures that will improve the living conditions of the laborer and of carrying these measures into effect. We must see that laws are enacted which will not permit the exploitation of the employee by his employer and which will leave no loopholes that may be used to defeat the ends of justice. We must rely for the security of this new nation, not so much upon the might of brute force, but upon the undivided loyalty of every citizen to the Government –a loyalty founded upon individual consciousness that this Government is his, and that it exists only for his protection, for his liberty, and for his happiness.\\nBoth the Department of Justice and the Department of Labor are ready to help you in the preparation of the measures that are required to fill the gap that may be found in our existing legislation, for the purpose of correcting prevailing social evils and of carrying into effect the provisions of the Constitution as well as the commitments in our platform.\\nThe Proceeds of the Excise Tax on Oil\\nFortunately for us a new source of income has come to our hands that will facilitate the carrying out of our program of social justice and economic readjustment. From the proceeds of the excise tax on oil there has been accumulated up to the end of June, 1937, the sum of P96,507,227.30 in the Federal Treasury, the transfer of which amount to the Treasury of the Philippines I had secured before I left America on my last trip. This sum is now available for appropriation, the understanding with the Treasury Department of the United States being that out of that fund, P10,000,000 will be available upon thirty days’ notice and the balance upon ninety days’ notice.\\nThe final decision as to how this fund shall be spent is, of course, yours. But in the exercise of my constitutional prerogative I shall take the liberty of making some suggestions regarding the purposes for which this money should be spent.\\nThe first thing that we must bear in mind is that this fund does not constitute an ordinary income of the Government upon which we may depend for recurring obligations. When independence shall have been granted, this source of our income will cease. Were we to defray from this fund services that we cannot maintain once this income is terminated, we would have thrown away the money thus spent. We must, therefore, limit the use of this fund for national objectives, for purposes where the greater good may be derived by the Filipino people.\\nConcretely, I recommend that this fund be devoted to the following purposes:\\n1.   To improve sanitary conditions of centers of population by constructing water systems or artesian wells.\\n2.   For combating malaria where there is assurance that it can be done at a reasonable expense.\\n3.   For the prevention of tuberculosis and the establishment of more sanitoriums, as it is well known that the white plague is the worst scourge afflicting our race.\\n4.   For the building of new leprosariums which will permit lepers in the early stage of the disease to be treated where they may be easily reached by their families, thus making their isolation less tragic.\\n5.   For extending free dispensary service to the poor not only in centers of population but also in outlying barrios and communities.\\n6.   For building public schools in every barrio where there is a sufficient number of children justifying the opening of the school.\\nIn this connection, I desire to state that it was with great reluctance that I vetoed the bill passed in your last sessions appropriating funds for school buildings. A subcommittee of the Committee on Public Instruction came to see me to secure my approval to a measure that would appropriate P5,000,000 for school buildings even before approving the regular budget of the Government. The Department of Public Instruction is now ready to furnish you with all the necessary information.\\nThe Constitution imposes upon the Government of the Philippines the duty to give every boy and girl of school age the opportunity to receive primary instruction. As soon as there are sufficient school buildings to accommodate all the school-age population of the Philippines and permanent means for supporting the schools have been created, there should be implanted here, in my opinion, compulsory universal primary instruction. In the meantime we should make it compulsory for every boy and girl who is now in our public schools, and those who may be admitted next year and thereafter to remain in school during the period required for the entire primary instruction. Means should be immediately provided to carry this policy into effect.\\nOne of the discoveries which we have made since the establishment of the Government of the Commonwealth is that, despite the large number of children that have gone through our public schools, as shown in the reports of the Bureau of Education, the literacy of the Islands has not increased proportionally, and the knowledge of those rudimentary subjects which the citizen of a democracy should have, has not been acquired by a population corresponding to the number of children that appear to have entered the public schools. The reason for this is simple. A large proprtion of the boys and girls who have been admitted to the schools have not remained long enough to acquire any kind of useful knowledge.\\n7.   For opening national highways and helping in the construction of provincial and even barrio roads whenever the respective provinces and municipalities pledge themselves to maintain the roads thus constructed, and in the case of barrio roads, where the volume of traffic on said roads also justifies their construction.\\n8.   For the construction of office buildings for the National Government so as to reduce, if not eliminate, the continuous expense in rents.\\n9.   For the purchase of large landed estates and their resale in small lots to the actual occupants thereof.\\nWe are committed to the policy of acquiring the haciendas which, in the opinion of the Government, should be subdivided in small lots and resold to the tenants actually working on said lots. In a message to the National Assembly in its first regular session, I stated that we were not in a position to redeem this pledge, not only because we had no funds with which to purchase these estates, but also because I feared that we would only be transferring the trouble faced by the owners of these estates to the Government itself. Since then we have come into this fund accruing to the Commonwealth from the processing tax on oil, and I deem it proper and wise to use a part of it for the acquisition of these haciendas. In order that the Government may accomplish its objective more completely this time than when it brought the Friar lands, I have appointed a committee to study the whole question in its varied aspects with instructions to submit it recommendations not later than November 15, 1937. As soon as the committee submits its report, I shall refer the same to the National Assembly for such action as you may deem proper and expedient in the light of the recommendations therein contained.\\n10.                For the development of water power, the reforestation of denuded areas, the colonization and development of Mindanao; and\\n11.                For the financing of a long range program of economic adjustments necessary to prepare the country for the new situation attending the grant of our independence, including the establishment of new industries which at the same time will give work to the unemployed.\\nIt is expected that the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs will include in its report a well considered program of economic adjustments to supplement its recommendation on future American-Philippine trade relations. As soon as this report has been received by me it will be immediately submitted to you for your consideration.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, before closing, allow me to emphasize the need to of giving the common man in the Philippines the benefits that the citizenry of every progressive democracy is entitled to receive. I am sure that every one of you will give to this noble task the best that is in him. An opportunity has been offered us that no past or coming generation has had or will ever have –that of creating a nation where there will be no privileged class, where poverty will be unknown, where every citizen will be duly equipped with the knowledge that will enable him to perform his duties and to exercise his rights properly and conscientiously, and where every man, woman, and child his fireside will be thankful to God for living in this beautiful and blessed land.\\n  \n",

\\nMessage\\nof\\nHis Excellency Manuel L. Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the First National Assembly\\nOn the Revision of the System of Taxation\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the Third Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 24, 1938]\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nThe state of the nation remains practically the same as reported in my annual message to your Honorable Body at the beginning of your last regular session on the 16th of October, 1937.\\nWe are earnestly concerned with social justice. Without a strict application of social justice to all elements of the community, general satisfaction of the people with their government is impossible to achieve. Here, in the just and equitable solution of social problems, is the real test of the sufficiency of democracy to meet present-day conditions of society.\\nSocial justice involves many and varied questions, such as taxation, wages, land ownership, insurance against accidents and old age, etc.\\nI desire to direct your attention at this time to one subject only—taxation—which we are solemnly committed to revise in order to place the burden upon those who should and can best carry it.\\nTaxation is imposed in the interest of the nation: to keep peace and maintain order; to repel invasion; to prove the living conditions of the people; to educate them; to promote agriculture, industry and trade.\\nThe power to tax may also be used to prevent the accumulation of vast wealth in a few hands. This is not to deny the right of property of the individual, but it is to affirm that this right may be limited by the State when social well-being demands it. The root of the worldwide discontent among peoples, which gave birth to communism in Russia and which has been at the bottom of every revolution of the last forty years, has been the utter disregard by governments of the social purpose of property. Selfish interests have been allowed to dictate government policies affecting social and economic life.\\nIn the past, taxation has not been concerned with principles of justice and rarely has it been concerned with bettering the people. Rather it has sought only to produce revenues and to place the burdens on the backs of those least able to remonstrate. It has done this by taxes on consumption, on sales, on licenses to engage in business, trade or profession, and by excessive charges on services which should be rendered by the Government and for which only a sufficient charge should be made to cover the cost. Those who rule have not paid their share. They have exempted the wealth they owned and the incomes they enjoyed almost wholly from taxation. This has been true throughout the world. It has been true of the Philippines as well.\\nOur tax system, unlike our political system, is still a heritage of earlier centuries, out of harmony with those principles which should guide progressive nations today. The Filipino people have one of the most progressive constitutions in the world. That Constitution is built not only on the principle of political equality but also on the added principle of social justice.\\nIt remains for us to parallel our achievement in the realm of political science by a similar achievement in the realm of economic and social justice.\\nThe present system of taxation in the Philippines is a source of the greatest injustice from which our people suffer. It may properly be said that our burdens of taxation rest most heavily upon the masses, and very lightly upon the rich. Bearing in mind the income of the rich as compared to the earnings of the labouring class, it is a fact that the richer the taxpayer the less he contributes proportionately to the maintenance of the Government. The picture of the distribution of taxes in the Philippines is this: The wage earner and the small farmer as a class carry most of the burden, then comes the middle class, and lastly the upper class. This wealthy upper class constitutes a very small percentage of our population.\\nIn your last session you have done away with the one direct tax which was imposed upon the poor in the same amount as upon the rich— the cedula tax. But even after the elimination of this odious tax which accrued exclusively to the provincial and municipal governments, it is still true that as far as the National Government is concerned, its income comes mostly from customs duties, the tax is ultimately paid by the consumer, and in the case of internal revenue taxes, with very few exceptions, the bulk of the tax is also paid by the consumer. Needless to say, if most of these taxes are paid by the consumer, it is the great mass of the people who are carrying the burden.\\nThe extent to which the Commonwealth is supported by the great mass of the people through taxes on consumption is not generally realized. Taxes on consumption are of necessity taken almost entirely from the poor. These taxes are added to costs as are all other elements of the cost. Thus, in 1936 the total revenue of the National Government, including the customs, amounted to approximately P85,000,000. Of this sum less than P5,000,000 came from direct taxes on incomes while the total taxes paid by inheritances and wealth amounted to less than P1,000,000. Deducting incidental revenues and other earnings, there remained P52,500,000 in the form of indirect consumption taxes on the things the people used , and for the most part had to use. They were in the form of customs taxes, excise taxes, license taxes, sales taxes, and similar charges.\\nThe revenues of the provinces and municipalities, excluding contributions from the National Government, amounted to P46,000,000. Except for such taxes on real estate as are ultimately borne by the owners of the real estate, the great bulk of these taxes were consumption taxes or charges on the living costs of the people.\\nIn other words, approximately P100,000,000 have been taken from fifteen million people not according to their ability to pay but according to their need to exist. This burden is equivalent to possibly P40 per family. And this burden is borne by millions of our people whose total family income is between P100 and P200 a year. There is no escape from the fact that the Commonwealth is supported in large part by those who are already on a low margin of subsistence.\\nIn forty years’ time we have taken from these classes a sum which approximates the accumulated wealth of the entire Philippines, agricultural as well as industrial. Within the past generation these consumption taxes have rebuilt the Commonwealth. They gave us our docks and harbours, our streets and highways, our schools and public buildings. The taxes from the poor have in fact made possible the Commonwealth which we now enjoy. It is their contributions that have given us security. They have paid for our courts of justice. They have preserved our health. They are maintaining our military establishments. They have made the Philippines a safe and comfortable place in which to dwell. It is the centavos of the millions that have created the conditions which have made our industries possible. Almost alone the masses have built the Commonwealth by their sacrifices. This has been going on for more than three hundred years. It is a system which we inherited from Old Europe, in which a few enjoyed all the privileges while the people did the work and also paid for the support of the state.\\nIt is not social justice alone, it is ordinary justice that demands correction of this age-long injustice.\\nWhile in the case of the customs duties, we are not free at this time to introduce radical or even any important change in our laws, we are not placed in the same position with reference to the internal-revenue taxes. We must proceed at once to reduce and, whenever possible, to eliminate altogether, every internal-revenue tax which is passed on ultimately to the consumer, such for instance as the sales tax. The sales tax is not paid by the merchant but by the public who buys the articles for its consumption. The merchants, in paying the sales tax of 11 per cent for every sale that they make, no matter how many times, are only acting as collectors for the Government, and the real person who pays the tax is the last purchaser, the consumer. The sales tax, moreover, is not only unjust to the poor; it also is injurious to the healthy growth of business. There are historian-economists who attribute the ruin of Spanish industries in the sixteenth century to the sales tax. In the United States, the Federal Government imposes no sales tax, and only a certain number of States impose it. But regardless of how other governments secure their revenues, it remains true nevertheless that the sales tax is unfair to the poor and harmful to the business. I, therefore, recommend the amendment of the sales tax law so as to eliminate completely the sales tax on every article that is of prime necessity and leave it only for luxuries, in which case, the tax should be materially increased. However, in no case should the sales tax be cumulative, but rather it should be paid only once at the source.\\nAnother advantage to the Government in the amendment of the sales tax law as suggested is that there can be no evasion of the payment of the tax as in the past. Nor will there be any need for a large number of internal-revenue collectors and inspectors who, in the performance of their duties, are unavoidably causing annoyance and irritation especially among the small merchants. Many small merchants, insufficiently trained to handle complicated accounts, waste time and energy in keeping their sales books in order. I am sure that the relief which thousands and thousands of small merchants all over the Philippines will receive from the abolition of the cumulative sales tax and of any tax on articles of prime necessity, will in itself compensate, in terms of satisfaction with their Government, for the loss, if any, that the treasury may suffer. I believe, too, that it is in part due to the difficulties that the average small Filipino merchant finds in keeping his books and paying his books and paying his sales tax that the retail trade is not largely in Filipino hands. It is my hope and belief that the abolition of the sales tax will encourage and facilitate the entry of more Filipinos with little capital into the retail business.\\nThere are other internal-revenue taxes that should be abolished or amended, such for instance as the license fees on the various professions. It is evidently unfair that a new lawyer or anew doctor should be made to pay the same amount of license as those most experienced and accredited in the profession they are paying. If it is the preference to keep this tax, at least there should be an exemption for those who have not been in the profession more than five years. In order that the Government may have a record of these practicing professionals, they may be compelled to pay only what is necessary to defray the cost of keeping that record.\\nThere are still other taxes on our cultural life that should be repealed or very materially reduced. One of these is the tax on radio sets which should not exceed P1 a year, except in the case of expensive sets which are luxuries. The radio should be available to every family. It is a means of political contact with their Government. It is a carrier of news, by which the people may be informed as to what is going on in the world. Through the radio adult education is possible. Through it, music and drama can be disseminated in every barrio. By means of the radio, police administration is made easier, and property and life made more secure. To tax such an instrument by an almost prohibitive charge to the poor is as indefensible as a prohibitive tax on the daily press.\\nIn the case of the market licenses, I recommend that the National Assembly enact a law prohibiting the municipalities from collecting market and shouse fees in excess of what is necessary to pay for their maintenance and upkeep. If, however, the municipality is still in debt for the construction of its market, it may be permitted, if deemed necessary, to collect higher taxes only until such cost has been fully recovered.\\nThe foregoing recommendations will mean a serious reduction in the income of the Government which we cannot afford to leave uncovered. Fortunately, there are many sources from which we can raise new taxes without causing any injustice to those who will have to pay, for we must see to it that these new taxes are just and fair, that they do not discourage initiative in sound business enterprises. Indeed, my very recommendation that the sales tax and licenses be done away with is in line with our purpose not to allow taxation to retard the proper economic development of the country nor to jeopardize the confidence of business in us.\\nIn your first regular session, you passed an act increasing the rates of our income tax, but the most cursory examination of the income tax paid in the Philippines both by corporations and individuals as compared with the income tax paid in other countries shows that we are practically imposing a nominal income tax. The United States is not the country that imposes the highest income tax, yet as compared with America, the income tax in the Philippines is but a trifle. Following is a comparative statement of the rates of income tax levied in the United States and in the Philippines.\\nCOMPARATIVE TABLES OF INCOME TAXES UNDER THE\\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX LAW AND THE PHILIPPINE\\nINCOME TAX LAW (AS OF 1936)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnited States\\nPhilippines\\n\\n\\nExceeding\\nNot Exceeding\\nBracket\\nRate Per cent\\nTax\\nRate Per cent\\nTax\\n\\n\\nP4000\\nP6000\\nP2000\\n4\\nP80\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n6000\\n8000\\n2000\\n5\\n180\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8000\\n10000\\n2000\\n6\\n300\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10000\\n12000\\n2000\\n7\\n440\\n1\\nP20\\n\\n\\n12000\\n14000\\n2000\\n8\\n600\\n1\\n40\\n\\n\\n14000\\n16000\\n2000\\n9\\n780\\n1\\n60\\n\\n\\n16000\\n18000\\n2000\\n11\\n1000\\n1\\n80\\n\\n\\n18000\\n20000\\n2000\\n13\\n1260\\n1\\n100\\n\\n\\n20000\\n22000\\n2000\\n15\\n1560\\n1\\n120\\n\\n\\n22000\\n26000\\n4000\\n17\\n2240\\n1\\n160\\n\\n\\n26000\\n30000\\n4000\\n19\\n3000\\n1\\n200\\n\\n\\n30000\\n32000\\n2000\\n19\\n3380\\n2\\n240\\n\\n\\n32000\\n38000\\n2000\\n21\\n4640\\n2\\n360\\n\\n\\n38000\\n44000\\n2000\\n24\\n6080\\n2\\n480\\n\\n\\n44000\\n50000\\n2000\\n27\\n7700\\n2\\n600\\n\\n\\n50000\\n56000\\n2000\\n31\\n9560\\n3\\n780\\n\\n\\n56000\\n62000\\n2000\\n35\\n11660\\n3\\n960\\n\\n\\n62000\\n68000\\n2000\\n39\\n14000\\n3\\n1140\\n\\n\\n68000\\n70000\\n2000\\n43\\n14860\\n3\\n1200\\n\\n\\n70000\\n74000\\n4000\\n43\\n16580\\n4\\n1360\\n\\n\\n74000\\n80000\\n2000\\n47\\n19400\\n4\\n1600\\n\\n\\n80000\\n90000\\n10000\\n51\\n24500\\n4\\n2000\\n\\n\\n90000\\n100000\\n10000\\n55\\n30000\\n5\\n2500\\n\\n\\n100000\\n110000\\n10000\\n58\\n35800\\n5\\n3000\\n\\n\\n110000\\n140000\\n30000\\n58\\n53200\\n6\\n4800\\n\\n\\n140000\\n150000\\n10000\\n58\\n59200\\n7\\n5500\\n\\n\\n150000\\n170000\\n20000\\n60\\n71000\\n7\\n6900\\n\\n\\n170000\\n200000\\n30000\\n60\\n89000\\n8\\n9300\\n\\n\\n200000\\n230000\\n30000\\n62\\n107600\\n9\\n12000\\n\\n\\n230000\\n250000\\n20000\\n62\\n120000\\n10\\n14000\\n\\n\\n250000\\n260000\\n10000\\n64\\n126400\\n10\\n15000\\n\\n\\n260000\\n300000\\n40000\\n64\\n152000\\n11\\n19400\\n\\n\\n300000\\n360000\\n60000\\n66\\n191600\\n12\\n26600\\n\\n\\n360000\\n400000\\n40000\\n66\\n218000\\n14\\n32200\\n\\n\\n400000\\n420000\\n20000\\n68\\n231000\\n14\\n35000\\n\\n\\n420000\\n480000\\n60000\\n68\\n272400\\n16\\n44600\\n\\n\\n480000\\n500000\\n20000\\n68\\n286000\\n18\\n48200\\n\\n\\n500000\\n540000\\n40000\\n70\\n314000\\n18\\n55400\\n\\n\\n540000\\n600000\\n60000\\n70\\n356000\\n20\\n67400\\n\\n\\n600000\\n750000\\n150000\\n70\\n461000\\n23\\n101900\\n\\n\\n750000\\n1000000\\n250000\\n72\\n641000\\n23\\n159400\\n\\n\\n1000000\\n1400000\\n400000\\n73\\n933000\\n26\\n263400\\n\\n\\n1400000\\n1800000\\n400000\\n73\\n1225000\\n29\\n379400\\n\\n\\n1800000\\n2000000\\n200000\\n73\\n1371000\\n32\\n443400\\n\\n\\n2000000\\n2200000\\n200000\\n74\\n1519000\\n32\\n507400\\n\\n\\n2200000\\n5000000\\n2800000\\n74\\n3591000\\n36\\n1515400\\n\\n\\nOver\\n5000000\\n———-\\n75\\n———-\\n36\\n———-\\n\\n\\n\\nIt should be borne in mind that besides the income tax which corporations and individuals in the United States pay to their Federal Government, they still have to pay income tax to their respective States. In the Philippines, however, the income tax is paid only to the National Government.\\nI advise against raising the income tax in the Philippines to anything near what is being collected in the United States. We are in the formative period of our national economy and we should not discourage the investment of capital. But we must increase the income tax because it is inexcusably low. Moreover, this is the time to adopt the policy of avoiding the accumulation of enormous wealth in a few hands and to force the return of excessive income to the public through the medium of government services supported by these taxes. It is in the case of corporations. Inheritance and income taxes that the Government must bear in mind the need of reverting to the nation large amounts of wealth that may be accumulated in a few hands. From the increase collections accruing to the National Government from the additional income tax that we contemplate imposing, an adequate proportion should be set aside for the provincial and municipal governments.\\nIt is my firm belief that if the recommendations made in this message are carried out by the National Assembly, we shall have gone far in our efforts to lay down the foundations of a nation wherein each citizen will contribute his part in the maintenance of the Government in proportion to his ability or resources. As we reduce the burden that is being unduly placed upon the masses of our people, on the one hand, and give them the wage that they are entitled to earn, on the other, we shall ultimately raise the standard of living as we reduce its cost, and thereby increase the purchasing power of the wage earner.\\nWe are liable to forget the fact that the business of the country does not come from great incomes that a few individuals residing in that country make, but from the earning power of the masses.\\nI hope that this Honorable Body will enact the laws herein recommended early in this session. We have talked enough of social justice. Even the walls have heard our speeches. We have made a good start. We have raised the wages of all government labourers. We have abolished the cedula tax. But we have not done enough. We have only begun. Now we are fully prepared to act and we must act at once, if our people are to continue placing their confidence for the remedy of the social evils which embitter their life entirely in our hands. The last general elections have proven beyond question that the people have wholeheartedly and enthusiastically approved of our avowed policies. The City of Manila, which, like every large city in the world, is usually in the opposition by large majorities, has voted practically for the whole Nacionalista ticket, the election of two councillors from the opposition being purely a vote for the individual rather than for the party to which each belongs. As for the rest of the country, all the newly elected governors are Nacionalistas; only one or two provincial board members and an occasional mayor belong to the opposition.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly: The time to act is now. Deeds and not words is what our people want. We dare not disappoint them.\\n  \n",

                                                      \\nMessage\\nof\\nHis Excellency Manuel L. Quezon\\nPresident of the Philippines\\nTo the Second National Assembly\\nOn the the State of the Nation and Important Economic Problems\\n[Delivered at the Opening of the First Session in the Assembly Hall, Legislative Building, Manila on January 24, 1939]\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly:\\nI take pleasure in congratulating you upon your election to this Second National Assembly, and to you, Mr. Speaker, I wish publicly to express my deep feeling of satisfaction that your distinguished colleagues have elevated you to this position of great responsibility and honor.\\nAs we enter upon the second and last period of my administration, we should once more make public avowal of our objectives and of our firm determination to achieve them.\\nThe Philippines is our country, and we shall make it the home of a free people—not alone politically, but economically as well. And this economic freedom must not be limited to the concept of national self-sufficiency, but must extend to every hamlet and hearth in this land. For of what practical value can the “right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” be to a person, if he does not actually enjoy it and his only freedom consists in the freedom to starve or die?\\nThis then is our ultimate goal: That the political rights vouchsafed to all our people by the Constitution be made real and effective by affording to every person willing to work the opportunity to earn a decent livelihood.\\nThe First National Assembly laid the foundations for the attainment of this goal. It made an enviable record worthy of emulation. Only a visionary could claim that this task can reach fruition during the life of one administration or of even a generation. We have to rebuild our national structure on the solid and permanent foundation of social justice. Laws alone will not do it. We have to fight against prejudices, wrong notions, and outworn customs and traditions. We have to preach the fundamental principles of Christianity, and make them the underlying philosophy of our political and social institutions.\\nThe great work initiated by the First National Assembly with such signal success we have to continue and carry forward. This is the mandate we have received from our people and which we dare not disobey.\\nNo party has ever received such a vote of confidence as the Nationalist Party did at the last general election. Not a single candidate from the minority parties has been elected to this body. The faith and trust which our people have placed in our party in this extraordinary manner demands, in turn, from each of us extreme fidelity and devotion to duty. Not only must we steadfastly forge ahead with our determination to elevate to the topmost the moral, cultural, political, economic, and social conditions of our people, that they may be free from every sort of bondage, but our official acts and deeds should be such as to convince our people of the earnestness and honesty of our aims.\\nAs the head of the State and the leader of our party, I venture to express the hope that the National Assembly will resist every temptation to divide itself into groups or blocs that may tend to weaken our unity of purpose and action. One of the dangers of such division lies in the possibility that the general interests of the nation may be overlooked, at least temporarily, and sacrificed for the benefit of the particular interests represented in the group or bloc. Obviously, one of the reasons why our people did not elect to the Assembly members representing the opposition is because they realize the importance of avoiding waste of time in political bickering in the proceedings of this body in these anxious days when every single energy we can command should be devoted to the difficult task of preparing our nation for an independent existence in an international situation so fraught with danger. Moreover, organized groups or blocs within a party are inconsistent with party responsibility and majority rule.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, with your permission, I shall now proceed to give you a report on the state of the nation and to submit my recommendations regarding measures of first importance which I consider deserving of your prompt attention. From time to time, I shall take the liberty of sending to this body other messages concerning matters which, in my opinion, should be acted upon at this session.\\nDuring the past year the country enjoyed peace and order. There have been conflicts between capital and labor, but without serious consequences. Both the Department of Labor and the Court of Industrial Relations are entitled to commendation for the happy solution of such conflicts. However, we would be closing our eyes to the realities of the situation were we to believe that labor in our country is satisfied with its lot. There is growing unrest and discontent, specially among the farm laborers, not due entirely to the activities of professional agitators and irresponsible so-called labor leaders. Our laborers cannot be easily led astray by agitators when they have no real grievances. The Government is deeply concerned with the well-being of our masses, and it will not cease in its efforts to better their condition until ample justice is secured to them.\\nNew public schools and classes have been opened and the enrollment in the public schools last year was increased by over 243,000. Approximately 18,500 kilometers of roads were in existence at the end of the year, and new wharves and other port facilities have been constructed. Public hospitals have been increased or enlarged, and clinics and dispensaries have been established in many localities. We are making progress in providing the remotest sections of the country with the services of doctors, dentists and nurses, and it is my earnest hope that during the next three years every town will be provided with these services. Sanitary conditions have been improved. We have not had any serious outbreak of epidemics and every threat or danger was effectively checked. An important housing project has been started in the vicinity of Manila to permit wage-earners and low-salaried employees to acquire or build their own homes. Should this project be successful, as I hope it will be, similar projects will be initiated in other communities.\\nGenerally speaking, our national defense program has been carried out as planned, both as to cost and the number of men trained. Two full classes of trainees have now been processed through the instructional cadres and their organization into effective military unit’s proceeds apace. Acquisition of arms, equipment and supplies is in approximate step with the production of tactical units. The Air Corps is steadily evolving into an effective fighting unit, both as to personnel and to equipment.\\nDeserving of special mention is the Philippine Military Academy in Baguio and its progress toward the establishment of a training course calculated to produce a highly trained, loyal and efficient professional leadership for our Army.\\nOne accomplishment of the year toward which effort had been long directed was the separation of the Constabulary from the Army. From the beginning it was realized that law enforcement is not properly a military responsibility. Yet the necessity for using the Constabulary, as it existed in 1935, as the nucleus out of which to establish the Army’s foundation, and the paucity of trained men for key positions had been the causes of the temporary consolidation heretofore existing. In the hope of avoiding wholesale transfers from the Army for police work, the establishment of a State Police from civilian sources was attempted in 1936. When the lack of trained personnel demonstrated that this method could succeed only if large numbers of officers and enlisted men were made available, it was decided, to avoid administrative complications, to separate from the Army the necessary individuals and organize them into a Constabulary. This has been done, and there is every reason to believe that the reconstituted organization will quickly earn a popular respect and prestige equal, and even superior, to the reputation in this regard enjoyed by the organization that existed prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth.\\nAs a final word respecting the Army, I want to urge you, once again, to give to all matters concerning our future security the earnest consideration their fundamental importance deserves. If eternal vigilance is the price of freedom, let us then be ceaselessly vigilant. Our defensive system requires no unusual sacrifice by any individual, but its success depends primarily and almost exclusively upon a unification of the efforts of all toward this common and vital purpose. To attain such unification in a democracy, the military plan must be supported by popular intelligence, confidence, and enthusiasm. It is a special function of Government to see that this confidence is fairly earned and assiduously sustained. To this end let us see to it that every law we pass and every military measure we adopt shall reflect an unselfish and national purpose, that it shall impose injustice on none, and that it shall promote the security and defend the peace, the possessions and the liberty of all.\\nThe business enterprises of the Government, especially the Philippine National Bank and the Cebu Portland Cement Company, were operated at a profit during the past year. The Manila Railroad Company has at long last completed its southern line. The gap which existed for many years between Tayabas and Camarines Sur was connected at a cost of about P2,000,000. This was one of my dreams that have come true. The significance of this achievement will be readily seen when we consider the fact that a daily, comfortable, fast and inexpensive communication service has been established between Manila and the Bicol provinces. At the same time the completion of this southern line means increased earnings for the railroad. The National Rice and Corn Corporation stabilized palay and rice prices at levels which, under the circumstances, properly safeguarded the interests of consumers and producers alike. The National Development Company is completing the construction of certain factories and studying the organization of others, in line with our policy to promote industrial development and provide more opportunities for the employment of labor. It is our policy with regard to many of these new industries merely to do pioneering work and ultimately to transfer them to private ownership and management.\\nOur foreign trade during 1938 suffered a slight reduction, mainly on account of low prices for our export products. It is to be noted, moreover, that our imports increased materially, while our exports decreased in value resulting in larger imports than exports decreased in value, resulting in larger imports than exports. This is an unhealthy condition for a country like the Philippines and every step should be taken to guard against the persistence of this adverse balance of trade. This situation may be due in part to increased purchasing power as a result of the expenditure by the Philippine Government of proceeds of the excise taxes on Philippine products collected in the United States. At the beginning, these remittances were made through the Dollar Exchange Standard Fund which resulted in an increase of circulation. In order to avoid this undesirable effect, the necessary measures have been adopted to effect the transfer of these funds through normal bank exchange transactions, without the necessity of releasing new currency by the National Treasury.\\nTax receipts exceeded budget estimates during the last year. The income from taxation, however, for the year 1938 was P8,076,362.49 below the collections for the year 1937, exclusive of the proceeds of the excise taxes from the United States. This reduction in revenue may be attributed to three causes: (1) the low prices for our agricultural products both for domestic consumption and for export, (2) the stock market slump during the year 1938, and (3) the fact that in 1937 large amounts were collected for taxes due in preceding years. Despite the reduction in the public revenues the fiscal position of the Government remains sound and strong. As the budget which I shall present to the National Assembly will reveal, the expenditures of the Government during the year 1938 were well within the income for that year, with an excess in collections accruing to the general fund over the ordinary expenditures amounting to P12,410,420.21 at the close of the year.\\nThe low prices for our export crops during the past year were a serious blow to a large portion of our population. This emphasizes the necessity that we should endeavor to establish our economy in an ever-growing proportion on the basis of our home market, because export crops must face conditions which are beyond the control of our Government.\\nAs I have already reported to the last National Assembly, the President of the United States, in consultation with me, appointed the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs to study and make recommendations concerning future trade relations between the United States and the Philippines. The Committee has submitted its report and recommendations to the President of the United States and to the President of the Philippines. Copies of this report were furnished to the members of this body. The report will be officially transmitted to the Assembly tomorrow. I commend it to your careful and earnest consideration. President Roosevelt and I have both approved the report and recommendations of the said Committee and it is my understanding that the President will urge the Congress to enact appropriate legislation to carry into effect those recommendations. One of these recommendations is to do away with the restrictions on the expenditure of the proceeds of the excise tax on coconut oil, and another is to bind copra and abaca free of United States duty during the Commonwealth period. While it is not necessary for the National Assembly to pass any legislation effectuating such recommendations until the Congress of the United States has acted thereon, I earnestly recommend that you approve a resolution endorsing the recommendations of the report, so that the Congress of the United States may be informed that, if it should take favorable action on said recommendations, the National Assembly would do likewise. It is my hope that the Congress of the United States will approve legislation putting into effect the recommendations of the report at an early date, in order to place American-Philippine trade relations on a more fair and equitable basis, and to permit the Philippines properly and intelligently to plan its economic adjustment in preparation for independence.\\nIn connection with this matter, I have sent as my special representative to Washington the Honorable Sergio Osmeña. Vice-President of the Philippines, to conduct, with the cooperation of the Resident Commissioner, the necessary negotiations with the Government of the United States. With the authority, they have enlisted the assistance of the Honorable Antonio de las Alas, formerly Secretary of Finance. I am in constant touch with the Vice-President who is keeping me advised of the progress of their work. So difficult and delicate a task could not have been entrusted to better hands.\\nYielding to the wishes of the members of the last National Assembly and of the business community, I agreed to defer action upon my proposals for a tax revision and appointed a Tax Commission to study the matter. The Tax Commission has effected a revision of our internal taxation, taking into consideration the fiscal adequacy of our system of public revenue, a more fair and just allocation of the tax burden, and the need of insuring a more equitable and sound redistribution of wealth. I also instructed the Commission to revise the tax system of our local governments with a view to supplying them with definite sources of revenue and a sufficient income to meet their growing needs. The report of the Tax Commission will be transmitted to you at an early date and I trust that it will receive your favorable attention.\\nI also desire to submit to your consideration the enactment of necessary legislation for the settlement of sparsely populated regions of the Philippines, specially in Mindanao. This is important not only for obvious political reasons and as a means to promote economic development, but also to relieve the acute congestion of population existing in certain agrarian areas. The National Economic Council has recommended a carefully prepared plan to carry out this objective. The plan contemplates a ten-year program aiming at the settlement in these vacant areas of about 500,000 people on selected lands adapted to subsistence farming and the production of certain money crops. This project will require an estimated total outlay of P20,000,000 which may be appropriated from the proceeds of the excise taxes. The report and recommendations of the National Economic Council on this matter will be transmitted to the National Assembly within a few days.\\nAnother problem which demands immediate attention concerns banking and credit, the cost of credit, and credit facilities for commerce, agriculture, and industry. The only institution in the Philippines that grants agricultural credit is the Philippine National Bank, but the limit fixed by law on the amount of the capital and resources of the Bank which may be invested in such credits has already been reached and the Bank is unable to give any more agricultural loans. Credit for capital investment is not available. There is practically no market for industrial bonds. Prevailing rates of interest charged by banks and private money lenders are still high, which fact is a drag upon economic enterprise and business prosperity. The National Economic Council is recommending a reform of our banking structure in order to remedy these evils. The Council proposes the creation of an investment bank for agriculture and industry, to which shall be transferred all the activities of the Philippine National Bank except those exclusively pertaining to commercial banking. The Council also recommends the establishment of a reserve and rediscount institution which will operate precisely in the same manner as the Federal Reserve System in the United States. This will provide a reasonable degree of elasticity and control over the money market and should immediately result in releasing for investment many millions of idle cash now prudently held by the banks as reserves in excess of legal requirements. These proposals will not only insure sufficient credit facilities at reasonable cost, but will, in my opinion, afford credit to small farmers, either directly or through cooperatives, and likewise to large industrial enterprises. Upon the approval of these measures, the Assembly may also consider the wisdom of amending the Usury Law by reducing the maximum rates of interest that can be charged. Considering the importance of credit as an aid to economic enterprise, I request that these proposals, which will be transmitted to you shortly, be given early consideration.\\nOne of the most pressing needs of the Philippines is develop men with the necessary technological training to supply the needs of modern industry and agriculture. There is likewise great need for men who may assume positions of responsibility in the management of business and industry. I believe that the institution which should be principally expected to supply these men is the University of the Philippines. Hence, I have urged the authorities of the University to propose plans for a reorganization of that institution with a view to raising its standards and placing it on the same level with the best institutions of its kind in the world. Pursuant to my request, the Board of Regents has been studying a plan of reforms in that institution and has employed two of the most competent educators of the United States to act as its advisers in that important task. One of the recommendations of the Board of Regents has been studying a plan of reforms in that institution and has employed two of the most competent educators of the United States to act as its advisers in that important task. One of the recommendations of the Board of Regents is the transfer of the University of the Philippines to a new site. This is considered essential in order that University students may be brought under a more strict and wholesome supervision and control, and the proper spirit and atmosphere may be created on the University campus. Moreover, the physical plant of the University must be enlarged and improved, and suitable laboratories provided, if it is to be enabled to grant adequate professional training, specially in science, demanded by present-day progress. Besides being inconveniently located, the actual site of the University is too small to permit of these improvements. The transfer of the College of Medicine will require the construction of a modern hospital on the new site. At any rate, the Philippine General Hospital is no longer adequate to supply the needs of the growing population of Manila, particularly for free patients, and a new hospital is instantly necessary. This transfer of the University will require a considerable outlay, but I believe that the expenditure will be more than justified if we succeed in our efforts to capacitate that institution to supply the Commonwealth with properly trained professional men, business executives, economists, and scientists. Once reorganized and its standards raised, the University of the Philippines would set a mark for private universities to emulate. Fortunately, the present physical plant of the University will not be wasted. The Government is in dire need of buildings to house several offices and the present buildings of the University can be made adequate for that purpose. It would be highly desirable for the National Assembly to act upon the proposed transfer of the University of the Philippines at this session, so that the Government may consider the availability of the buildings of the University in framing its program of construction for government offices.\\nHeretofore, the municipal and city governments have had, by law, the responsibility of maintaining all elementary instruction. But in order that the purpose of the Constitution may be accomplished, it has been necessary for the National Government to assume the burden of supporting the primary schools, leaving to the local governments only the maintenance of intermediate instruction. As regards secondary instruction, I recommend that provincial governments be authorized to spend their funds only for vocational high schools and not for academic high schools, which, beginning with the school year 1940-1941, should be maintained on a self-supporting basis. Vocational high schools, however, should continue to receive adequate national aid.\\nTo properly cope with the problem of public health and sanitation, I desire to recommend the establishment of a Department of Public Health. This is necessary for a more effective coordination of public health administration, the better to insure the protection and care of the health of our people, particularly those in early age. Furthermore, it is desirable that the Department of Public Instruction be placed in a position to devote itself exclusively to the far-reaching problems of education and to give greater impetus to the up building of the character and physique of our youth. The new Department of Public Health should be given administrative supervision over public sanitation, hospitals, asylums, clinics, dispensaries, and other institutions that minister to the health of the people.\\nIn order to effect an orderly and scientific development of our agriculture and to permit the intelligent planning of agricultural production, it is essential that as soon as possible we undertake an agronomical survey of the Philippines. The Department of Agriculture and Commerce has completed the soil survey of several provinces. This work should be supplemented and accelerated. This agronomical survey has been recommended by the National Economic Council and the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs. I request that sufficient funds be appropriated to carry out this survey, which should indicate to the Government and to the people the crops adapted to different sections of the country.\\nAnother recommendation of the Joint Preparatory Committee on Philippine Affairs is the establishment of agricultural experiment and extension stations. This is a project which should merit our immediate consideration, if we wish to stimulate agricultural enterprises and modernize agricultural methods. I recommend the repeal of the present law requiring a 5 per cent contribution by provinces and municipalities to the local agricultural fund. Better results could be obtained by a consolidation of these experiment and extension stations in typical areas than by dispersing them, as at present, and often duplicating the experiments, in each province. I recommend an appropriation from the proceeds of the excise taxes of a sufficient amount to cover the expenses for the establishment and operation of these situations in such localities as may be determined by the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. Another reason which induces me to make this recommendation is the fact that the finances of local governments are inadequate to support this service and that they cannot continue setting aside such a large portion of their revenues for these stations without jeopardizing other activities imperatively needed by local communities.\\nModern industry and agriculture can not be efficiently operated without the aid of scientific research. This is particularly true in the Philippines where technological science of common knowledge is so far behind other countries. We have secured the advice of a renowned scientist to assist the Government in the establishment of an institution for scientific research. It should serve not only the Government but also private industry and agriculture. I shall submit to the National Assembly appropriate recommendations on this subject as soon as the studies of the National Economic Council and the Department of Agriculture and Commerce are completed.\\nThe National Economic Council has recommended the establishment of an Institute of Nutrition. In order to protect the health and build up the physique of our masses such an institution is necessary. The people need to be educated on the nutritive value of different food products. There are many wholesome and nutritious articles that are consumed in some sections of the country which are unknown in others. It is also necessary t formulate dietary programs scientifically balanced which shall be within the reach of the people of the most modest means. Once the Institute completes its study of the different food products that could be produced abundantly and cheaply in the Philippines, the Department of Agriculture and Commerce could conduct a campaign for the production of national interests, has agreed with our Government that political refugees who desire to come to the Philippines shall not be given visas by American consuls without the previous approval of our Government. We owe it largely to His Excellency, the United States High Commissioner, that the State Department was fully appraised of the situation and that this administrative policy was adopted.\\nAt the last session of the First National Assembly I had occasion to express publicly our indebtedness to High Commissioner McNutt for his unstinted cooperation with our Government. I reiterate those sentiments now. It is, therefore, with a sense of great loss for our people and for me that I have heard of his contemplated return to the United States. If he should find it necessary to resign his present post, we would be deprived of a true friend and a most able collaborator, one whom we need at this most critical period and who would be very hard to replace. But if he must leave us, we wish him to know that he takes with him our affection and gratitude, and our prayer that he may succeed in his future undertakings.\\nTo protect the interests of our people and to repair an injustice done to certain races by existing legislation, we should enact a new immigration law. Under our present immigration law passed by the Congress of the United States, Chinese, Indians, and some other Orientals may not be admitted into the Philippines. Ours is an oriental country, and we are an oriental people. We belong to the same racial stock as some of those excluded by our laws. So long as other foreigners are allowed to immigrate to the Philippines, we should admit, under the same terms and conditions, those coming from oriental countries. To avoid, however, a large influx of immigrants from any one country, we should establish a quota that will be the same for all countries.\\nGentlemen of the National Assembly, the world in which we live today is an entirely different world from that which we knew only a few years ago. Whereas before the World War, democracy was gaining ground everywhere, mankind is now divided into two great camps—those who believe in democracy and those who feel contempt for it as a completely discredited system of government. By our political education, by our convictions and by our inclinations, we are a democracy. We have established a democratic system of government and the perpetuation of this system will depend upon our ability to convince our people that democracy can be freed from those vices which have destroyed it in some countries, and that it can be made as efficient as any other system of government known to man. It behooves us; therefore, to prove that through a wise use of democratic processes, the welfare and the safety of the people can be promoted, thus contributing our share to the preservation of democracy in the world.\\n  \n",

OF THE PHILIPPINES\\nTO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES\\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 23 July 2018]\\nKindly sit down. Thank you for your courtesy.\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the members of the Senate; House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo; His Excellency Gabriele Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio and the justices of the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga kababayan.\\nAbout two years ago, I solemnly took my oath as a worker of the national government. I was as inspired to institute real changes for the greater good of the Filipino people, as I was greatly overwhelmed then by the daunting challenges that lay ahead.\\nTwo years later, my solid commitment to directly and decisively address our nation’s collective challenges remains. It has not wavered. In truth, it has even gotten stronger through adversity and the desire to give the people the most we can, within my term in this government.\\nLet me begin by putting it bluntly: the war against illegal drugs is far from over. Where before, the war resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs worth millions of pesos, today, they run [into] billions in peso value. I can only shudder at the harm that those drugs could have caused had they reached the streets of every province, city, municipality, barangay and community throughout the country.\\nThis is why the illegal drugs war will not be sidelined. Instead, it will be as relentless and chilling, if you will, as on the day it began. These drug dealers know fully well that their business is against the law. They know the consequences of their criminal acts, especially when caught in flagrante delicto and they violently resist arrest. They know that illegal drugs waste away lives, dysfunctionalize families, and ruin relationships. They know that once hooked, addicts will die slowly — slow deaths. And yet, they persist in doing what they do, oblivious to the terrible harm that they cause to the people and communities.\\nAnd when illegal drug operations turn nasty and bloody, advocates of human rights lash at—and pillory—our law enforcers and this administration to no end. Sadly, I have yet to hear really howls of protest from the human rights advocates and church leaders against drug-lordism, drug dealing and drug pushing as forceful and vociferous as the ones directed against the alleged errant [law] enforcers in the fight against this social scourge.\\nIf you think that I can be dissuaded from continuing this fight because of [your] demonstrations, your protests, which I find, by the way, misdirected, then you got it all wrong. []\\nYour concern is human rights, mine is human lives. [] The lives of our youth are being wasted and families are destroyed, and all because of the chemicals called shabu, cocaine, cannabis, and heroine.\\nHuman rights to me means giving Filipinos, especially those at the society’s fringes, a decent and dignified future through the social and physical infrastructures necessary to better their lives.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe lives and freedoms and the hard-earned property of every Filipino whose condition we wish to improve shall be protected from criminals, terrorists, corrupt officials, and traffickers [of] contrabands.\\nYou worry about the present; I am concerned [about] both the present and the future. [] I worry about the future because I know what crimes can do to the youth of this country. If not stopped, crimes can make human cesspools of succeeding generations. I will not allow it to happen. Not during my term.[]\\nTime and again, I have stressed that corruption must stop. [] Corruption is like a leech that it bleeds the government of funds programmed for its infrastructure and other social development projects. It saps the morale or the morale of dedicated and honest government workers.\\nCorruption destroys those who succumb to its temptation and eventually it is the innocent who will suffer and bear its horrible consequences.\\nThe love of money is corrosive. And sadly, the desire to make the easy kind by being imaginative and manipulative, corrupts absolutely. Stolen wealth does not make the thief respectable. Neither will the trappings of wealth mask [nor] cap the stink that thievery exudes. One day, justice will catch up with those who steal government funds. And when that day comes, it will be the public who will have its retribution.\\nWhile we run after those who steal the people’s money, we are also enhancing the government’s delivery of frontline services. I thank Congress for the swift passage of the Ease of Doing Business [Act], [] which is a significant fight against corruption and improving service delivery. We need to sustain our momentum. And I hereby direct all [local] government units — makinig sana kayo — and government agencies to faithfully implement this law and simply simplify the process. Hinihingi ko ho ‘yan sa lahat nasa gobyerno under my control and supervision. Huwag ho kayong magkamali.\\nI particularly call the attention of the agencies with the [most] number of red tape-related reports from the public, make your services truly customer-friendly. Our people deserve efficient, effective, and responsive government services. They deserve nothing less. [] Kayo lang ang ayaw eh. Gusto ng tao kayo ‘yung binabayaran, make your living from the pockets of the people, and you have a lousy and corrupt bureaucracy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have friends and political supporters whom I appointed to public office and then dismissed or caused to resign. I need not mention their names or recount the circumstances surrounding their removal or resignation. Media has more than amply reported that.\\nI value friendship, make no mistake about it. But it has its limits.\\nThis is a lonely place I am hemmed in. Do not make it lonelier by forcing me to end our friendship because you gave me the reason to end it. It pains me to end — the loss of friendships. And that is why I appeal to you to help me in my cause so that our friendship will endure.\\nFor as long as I can remember, the bulk of the income generated in Mindanao used to be remitted to what we, in Mindanao, refer [to] as the “Imperial Manila” to fund national projects primarily in the Metro Manila area, leaving a pittance to Mindanao as its share thereof. Mindanao was dubbed as “The Land of Promise,” and Mindanaoans say in derision that this is so because what it got from the government through the years were promises, promises and more promises.\\nWe aim to rectify that derisive observation and, as a matter of fact, we are now in the process of fulfilling that promise through significant increases in the budget for Mindanao. At the end of my term, I hope to see the promise of Mindanao fulfilled, or at the very least, approaching fulfillment.\\nBe that as it may, Mindanao pauses at the crossroads of history. One road leads to harmony and peace; the other, to war and human suffering.\\nDespite all that has been said [for] or against the Bangsamoro Organic Law by all sectoral groups, I make this solemn commitment that this administration will never deny our Muslim brothers and sisters the basic legal tools to chart their own destiny within the Constitutional framework of our country.\\nWhen the approved version is transmitted and received by my office… The law has been passed actually and I intend to… Give me 48 hours to sign it and ratify the law. [] Babasahin ko pa bago ko pipirmahan. Baka may isiningit kayo diyan na hindi maganda para sa — para sa ibang tao.\\nWe will need loads of understanding and patience to endure and overcome the birth pangs or pains of the new beginning. To me, war is not an option. We have been through the catastrophe in Marawi. We have seen the horror, the devastation, and the human toll and the displacement of both Christians and Muslims alike.\\nI have made a pledge that ISIS terrorists or groups or its allies will never gain foothold in our country. Yet, when what remained of the decimated Maute-ISIS group in Marawi finally saw the error of their ways and expressed their desire to be reintegrated into society, we welcomed them with open arms and embarked on genuine efforts to embrace a peaceful, productive life for them. We owe it to our fallen soldiers and police officers in Marawi and elsewhere to put an end to the bloodshed and seek the path of true peace—a peace that will last beyond this lifetime, and whose dividends our children will reap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn international relations, we shall continue to assert and pursue an independent foreign policy. Our long-term national development and national security goals come first.\\nWe shall continue to reach out to all nations regardless of their prevailing political persuasions or proximity to or distance from our shores so long as these nations wish us well.\\nOur stronger bonds with our ASEAN friends have made possible our trilateral border patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia, which has since then put out of business sea pirates, piracy and other terrorists who used to infest our shared seas. This is a testament to the readiness of our country and our good neighbors to make regional peace and security our shared responsibility.\\nWe have successfully hosted the 50th ASEAN Anniversary and the 31st ASEAN Summit last November 2017. We have shown the world what we are capable of when we work together. The ASEAN events showcased not only the world-renowned Filipino hospitality and organizational capabilities but also our artistic talent. I would like to commend the [ASEAN National] Organizing Council led by no less than my Executive Secretary, Salvador Medialdea. []\\nOur re-energized relations with China has also led to an unprecedented level of cooperation between our nations on the war against transnational crimes. Our shared intelligence led to the discovery and dismantling of the clandestine shabu laboratories and the arrest of Chinese chemists [connected] with the Dragon organization called Wu Syndicate.\\nOur improved relationship with China, however, does not mean that we will waver in our commitment to defend our interests in the West Philippine Sea.[] This is why we engage China through bilateral and multilateral platforms such as the ASEAN-China and the Philippines- China Bilateral Consultation Mechanism.\\nOpening lines of communication and amicably managing differences have led to positive developments that include renewed access of Filipino fishermen in the areas in dispute in the Philippines — West Philippine Sea.\\nParticipation in the ASEAN-China dialogue has also resulted to the draft framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea which intends to resolve disputes by peaceful means.\\nWe admire our Filipino migrant workers for their selflessness and courage in enduring the hardships of living away from home to provide for their families. You epitomize the innate resilience of the nation. You have shown your willingness to toil and sacrifice day-in and day-out, for the long-term good of your family and loved ones. You have also contributed greatly to the national economy, even as you help in small and big ways to the economies of our international partners.\\nThis is why we strongly condemn the deaths and abuses experienced by Filipino migrant workers in the hands of their foreign employers. I have said this before and I say it again: I am a worker of government, and it is my vow to make sure that your well-being remains our foremost foreign policy concern. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is for this reason that we are continuing to work with the host nations to ensure the welfare of our countrymen. I appeal to all host governments to help us, as true and dependable partners, in this endeavor.\\nI have always believed that no matter how well-intentioned a leader is, no matter how well- conceived may be his mission, if he lacks the political will to do what needs to be done, then he can only end up a failure and a hopeless dreamer.\\nAs a worker of government, I promised to do whatever it would take to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, fighting powerful interests and making sacrifices. My obligation is to promote and uphold the greatest good, for the greatest number. []\\nOur campaign against Endo has resulted in the regularization of more than 300,000 workers as of early this month. On May 1 of this year, I signed Executive Order 51, which sought to protect the workers right to security of tenure.\\nRead my lips, I understand that this does not satisfy all sectors. I share their sentiment; I truly do. Much as I would like to do the impossible, that power is not vested upon me by the Constitution. And neither will I make both ends meet even if I violate the laws to achieve that purpose. Simply, it is not part of my territory.\\nThat is why I add mine to their voices in asking Congress to pass legislation ending the practice of contractualization once and for all. []\\nOur farmers, especially our coconut farmers, form a significant part of the basic sectors of society. It is from the toil of their hands that we put food on the table. It is my hope that we finally see this through. I urge you Congress to convene the [bicameral] conference committee and pass at the soonest possible time the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund. [] I pray that you will do it.\\nMy administration remains firm in its resolve to ensure that the country’s telecommunications services are reliable, inexpensive and secure. A draft Terms of Reference for the entry of a new, major industry player is at hand. The terms will be fair, reasonable and comprehensive. It will be inclusive so it will be open to all interested private parties, both foreign and local. The only condition is that the chosen entity must provide the best possible services at reasonably accessible prices.\\nHowever, our efforts to usher in a new major player shall be rendered futile if we do not improve its odds of success in an industry that has long been dominated by a well-entrenched duopoly.\\nWe shall, therefore, lower interconnection rates between all industry players. Not only to lessen the cost to the consumers as it will also lower the costs [for the] incoming player to access existing networks, [thereby creating] a market environment that is more conducive to competition. This is a policy which is crucial to ensure that our solution to our telecommunication problems will be both meaningful and lasting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the last 2 years, experience has taught me that lack of consultation or insufficiency of information can, at times, lead to rash judgments. If and when I am unsure on the most appropriate course of action to take given the problem, it’s factual milieu and the desired end, I never fail to consult to discuss options with persons whom I trust and whose advice I value.\\nWhen I decided to establish Malasakit Centers in Cebu, Tacloban and Iloilo, my long-time aide, Bong Go and his team became instrumental in arriving at the right decision through proper consultations. []\\nDeliberations with the proper agencies also made me decide to push for, and eventually approve, both the [free] Tertiary Education Act and the increase in the salary of our men in uniform, our soldiers and our policemen. []\\nBoracay Island, widely regarded as one of our country’s treasures and admired worldwide for its natural beauty, has sadly become the representation of the government’s negligence, including mine.\\nI could not allow this decay to continue; decisive action has long been overdue. Recognizing that we are mere stewards of our natural resources, and I said enough is enough.\\nWe intend to restore its environmental integrity, alongside measures to alleviate those whose livelihood were momentarily affected. Environmental protection and ensuring the health of our people cannot be overemphasized; thus, our actions in Boracay mark the beginning of a new national effort.\\nThis is just [the beginning]. For the other tourist destinations needing urgent rehabilitation and enforcement of environmental and other laws shall soon follow. I urge our local government units to proactively enforce our laws and not wait for us to swoop down on your areas just to do your duty and work. [] At some other time, I would have to discuss sa local government units.\\nWhat has happened to Boracay is just an indication of the long-overdue need to rationalize, in a holistic and sustainable manner, the utilization, management, and development of our lands. I therefore urge the Senate to urgently pass the National Land Use Act [] to put in place a national land use policy that will address our competing land requirements for food, housing, businesses, and environmental conservation. We need to do this now.\\nTo help safeguard the present and the future generations, we have to earnestly undertake initiatives to reduce our vulnerabilities to natural hazards, and bolster our resilience to the impact of natural disasters and climate change.\\nAs I had stated last year, we must learn from the experiences from the Super-typhoon Yolanda, and other mega disasters, and from global best practices. We need a truly empowered department characterized by a unity of command, science-based approach and full-time focus on natural hazards and disasters, and the wherewithal to take charge of the disaster risk reduction; preparedness and response; with better recovery and faster rehabilitation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHence, we, in the Cabinet, have approved for immediate endorsement to Congress the passage of a law creating the “Department of Disaster Management,”[] an inter- agency — just like FEMA. Well, I don’t know if it’s — it’s an effective agency in the United’s government.\\nAn inter-agency crafted and a high-priority measure aimed at genuinely strengthening our country’s capacity for [resilience] to natural disasters. I fervently appeal to Congress to pass this bill with utmost urgency. Our people’s safety requirements cannot wait.\\nOurs is a rich and beautiful country, indeed. Add to that a great number of people equipped with technical expertise and professionalism, and you have a country poised to soar and take its place among the world’s economic and financial eagles. God willing. Inshallah.\\nNature endowed us with this wealth to be tapped for the benefit of all generations. My policy in the utilization of these resources is non-negotiable: the protection of the environment must be top priority [] and extracted resources must be used for the benefit of the Filipino people, [] not just a select few. Do not just give me taxes. I can get it from other sources. Give me what needs to be given to my countrymen. []\\nTo the mining industry, I say this once again and maybe for the last time, do not destroy the environment or compromise our resources; repair what you have mismanaged. Try to change [your] management radically because this time you will have restrictive policies. The prohibition of open pit mining is one. []It is destroying my country. It is destroying the environment. It will destroy the world of tomorrow for our children. []\\nAgain, I warn irresponsible miners, along with their patrons, to stop destroying our watersheds, recharge areas, forests, and aquatic resources. You can no longer fish in our rivers. It’s all contaminated. And the color is not even brown or white, it’s black. You want to see it? I will invite you. We can go to Diwalwal and the other mining areas. And I’m sure you will puke with what is happening to this country. Expect reforms, radical ones. I do not intend to quarrel with anybody, with the moneyed, but for as long as I am here I said: you will just have to contend with me.\\nI expect you to do your part in ensuring our nation’s sustainable development, starting now.\\nI exhort all concerned agencies and local government units to uphold the concept of inter- generational responsibility in [the exploration] and utilization of our mineral wealth, the protection and preservation of our biodiversity, anchored on the right to a balanced and healthy ecology.\\nI applaud Congress for the timely passage of the TRAIN law. You have made funds available to build better roads and bridges, and improve health and education, and strengthen our safety and security. Some have incorrectly blamed our efforts toward a fairer tax system for all the price increases in the past months, and some irresponsibly suggesting to stop TRAIN’s implementation. We cannot and should not. We need this for sustainable growth that leaves no Filipino left behind.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTRAIN is already helping poor families and senior citizens cope up with rising prices. We have distributed unconditional cash transfers to 4 million people, and we will help 6 million more this year.\\nFollowing the one-peso discount per liter in gas stations, we have also started releasing fuel vouchers to public utility jeeps and other valid franchises. Further, we have fast-tracked the distribution of NFA rice to provide affordable rice for all. [Excuse me.]\\nThis year, we are giving 149 billion pesos worth of subsidies to the poor and vulnerable. Next year, the amount will be increased to 169 billion pesos.\\nBut no amount of subsidy can help the poor if some businesses take advantage of the situation to make more money. I ask businesses to cooperate with us in charging a fair price.\\nTo help stabilize rice prices, we also need to address the issue of artificial rice shortage. I now ask all the rice hoarders, cartels and their protectors, you know that I know who you are: stop messing with the people. I hate to… Power sometimes is not a good thing. But I hope I will not have to use it against you.\\nConsider yourselves warned; mend your ways now or the full force of the State shall be brought to bear upon you. I am directing all intelligence agencies to unmask the perpetrators of this economic sabotage and our law enforcement agencies to bring them to justice.\\nWe are also working on long-term solutions. On top of this agenda to lower the price of rice. We need to switch from the current quota system in importing rice to a tariff system where rice can be imported more freely. This will give us additional resources for our farmers, reduce the price of rice by up to 7 pesos per kilo, and lower inflation significantly. I ask Congress to prioritize this crucial reform, which I have certified as urgent today.\\nAlam mo, ako humihingi talaga ng tulong. Business is really for profit I understand that. But the Philippines has always been a playground for, you know, scoundrels and those who do it without really considering the plight of the others. It’s all conscience.\\nWhen I ran for public office, I promised to do whatever it takes to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, even if it means fighting powerful interests. I am committed to a comprehensive tax reform, and I ask Congress to continue the job.\\nPackage 2 will lower corporate income taxes, especially for our small businesses. Lower taxes mean they will have more money to invest and create more jobs. More than 99 percent of our businesses are micro, small, or medium enterprises (MSME) and employ around 65 percent of our workers. The enactment of the Package 2 is what stands between today and millions of jobs in the near future.\\nCongressmen Cua, Gonzales, Abu, and Garin and Batocabe, as well as the Suansing family, filed versions of Package 2 last March 2018. Salamat po [] and I support their push to shepherd the bill. I hope the Senate will follow suit, maybe tomorrow, sir.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis matter is urgent. Do not be part of the problem by ignoring it. I hope to sign Package 2 before the year ends. I urge Congress to pass it in a form that satisfies our goals and serves [] the interests of the many, not just the wealthy few.\\nBy the end of July 2018, all 5 packages of my tax reform would have been submitted to Congress. Apart from TRAIN, rice tariffication, and Package 2, they include the mining, alcohol, and tobacco tax increase, reform in property valuation, reform in capital income and financial taxes, and an amnesty program.\\nI urge Congress to take them seriously and pass them in succession, for there is no chance that we can deliver our promises without an equitable tax system.\\nOne of the most important thrusts of this administration’s medium-term development plan is to cover all Filipinos against financial health risks. That is why I have directed concerned agencies to streamline the various sources of financial assistance for people with health-related needs.\\nWe are currently institutionalizing the unified implementation of the “No Balance Billing Policy” [] through which the government and our private healthcare providers can work out a system that will provide an order of charging of medical expenses.\\nMuch needs to be done to improve our healthcare system, which remains highly fragmented, resulting in disparity in health outcomes between the rich and the poor in the urban areas and rural. While investments in health have increased over the years, several policy and operational bottlenecks have constrained universal health care for this country.\\nWe shall pool all our resources for health services under the [PhilHealth]; institutionalize primary care as a prerequisite to access higher level of healthcare; and supplement human resource gaps of the LGUs through a National Health Workforce Support System.\\nThese will ensure that every Filipino [family] gets the appropriate, affordable, and quality health services in appropriate facilities and will be protected from financial burden due to sickness.\\nTo this end, I urge the speedy passage of the Universal Health Care Bill authored by Former Representative Harry Roque. [] Strong political determination, not political ambition, is the guiding light. []\\nI have no illusions of occupying this office one day longer than what the Constitution under which I was elected permits; or under whatever Constitution there might be.\\nFour administrations before me have tried to amend the Constitution to be able to introduce amendments and reservations to the charter — revisions rather to the charter. But none of them has successfully done for one reason or another.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI therefore consider it a distinct honor and privilege to have received earlier from the Consultative Committee that I created, the draft Federal Constitution that will truly embody the ideals and aspirations of all the Filipino people. []\\nI thank all the members of the Committee, especially those who came out from their retirement, for their valuable services in crafting this draft Federal Constitution. I would like to extend my particular gratitude to Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno [] and Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.[]\\nI am confident that the Filipino people will stand behind us as we introduce this new fundamental law that will not only strengthen our democratic institutions, but will also create an environment where every Filipino—regardless of social status, religion, or ideology—will have an equal opportunity to grow and create a future that he or she can proudly bequeath to the succeeding generations.\\nMy countrymen, I will not bore you with a litany of this administration’s projects completed otherwise in the process. That would be too self-serving. I have instead caused to be prepared a written report on what has — what was and what has been done in the months and probably in the years to come. The reports shall be made available within the next few days.\\nI was informed that satellite facilities were set up by the Presidential Communications Operations Office in certain far flung barangays so as of today the residents of these communities can watch the State of the Nation and for the first time see you on TV. I hope you have enjoyed the experience. []\\nIn ending, may I quote — I have always quoted but — in my previous talks. One American that I salute, the great Abraham Lincoln. And this has been — I’ve been in government for the last… If I completed my… If I complete my term, Inshallah, God willing, I would have served government for 40 years.\\nAnd I came across this statement which has been with me since I was a fiscal in the 70s. And he said: If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop, the presidency, might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is — what has been said against me won’t amount to anything. But if the end brings me out wrong, ten angels of God swearing that I was right would make no difference.\\nDaghang salamat ka ninyong tanan. []\\n— END —\\n\\n\\n\\n  \n",

at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 22 July 2019]\\n \\nThank you. Kindly sit down. Kumusta po kayo?\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, magandang hapon po sa inyo — sa iyo, ma’am, [] kung nasaan ka; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito, [] Macapagal- Arroyo []; His Excellency Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the other members of the Cabinet; Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga mahal kong kababayan.\\nLet me begin by extending my hand in gratitude to all who kept faith with me in our most trying times. Numbers speak a thousand words and tell a hundred tales. But the landslide victory of the Administration candidates as well as the latest survey results shows that my disapproval rating is 3%. [] I hope that the members of Congress — sana hindi kayo included sa 3% [] — inspires me with determination to pursue relentlessly what we have started at the start of my administration.\\nFew men imbued with the will and the courage to do what he believes is right and just and whatever be the opposition in terms of numbers and noise, makes a majority. For it is not the eagle in the fight but the fight in the eagle that matters. [] Believe me, I will end my term fighting.\\nIt has been three years since I took my oath of office, and it pains me to say that we have not learned our lesson. The illegal drug problem persists. Corruption continues and emasculates the courage we need to sustain our moral recovery initiatives.\\nYears ago, we saw the terrible devastation caused by illegal drugs. On May 23, 2017, our law enforcers launched an operation to serve a warrant and to neutralize terrorists. A group of armed men with sophisticated weaponry and aided by locals radicalized by extremist dogma and teachings fought our troops for weeks. During that Marawi Siege, tons of shabu worth millions and millions of pesos. Drug money killed 175 and wounded [2,101] of my soldiers and policemen in that five-month battle.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am aware that we still have a long way to go in our fight against this social menace. Let the reason why I advocate the imposition of the death penalty for crimes related to illegal drugs. Our citizens have begun to do their part in the war against drugs, and through the barangay formation of anti-drug councils, and also actually surrendering bricks of cocaine found floating in the sea into our islands. I call this responsibility. However, the drugs will not be crushed unless we continue to eliminate corruption that allows this social monster to survive.\\nI respectfully request Congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes [] related to drugs, as well as plunder.\\nMy countrymen, it is a sad commentary that we cannot distinguish our need from our greed, our principles from our prejudices, the real from the fake, and the truth from a lie. The reason is because that many of us, what matters above all is the “self.” It is selfishness [at] its worst for no purpose other than personal aggrandizement.\\nTo borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have not risen above and beyond the parochial interests. Our warped loyalty to family, friends and tribal kin continue to exact a heavy toll on our programs designed to uplift the poor and reassure our investors, our foreign investors local, and the business sector in this country.\\nThe recent uncovering of the massive fraud perpetrated against the public health insurance system proves that corruption is pervasive. Huge amounts of medical funds were released to cover padded medical claims and imaginary treatment of ghost patients. I am grossly disappointed. The government is conned of millions of pesos which could be used to treat illnesses and possibly save the lives of many. Thus I ordered the NBI to arrest and cause the prosecution of those liable. I appointed a new PhilHealth President, whom I know is a man of integrity, a military man, a former military officer, and gave him marching orders to prioritize ridding the agency of corruption.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy the way, I commend the Bureau of Investigation for its handling of high profile cases resulting in the arrest and prosecution of criminals. These culprits will have their day of reckoning in court. I hope it happens during the last three years of my term.\\nConcerning the unscrupulous persons manning our ports and scalawags in uniform, we have been unyielding in our reforms to weed them out of public service.\\nI have fired or caused the resignation of more than a hundred officials and appointees of government without regard to relationship, friendship and alliance. There is no sacred cow, as the saying goes, in my Administration.\\nInstitutions that are the stewards of our resources and agents of development have long been a major source of public frustration. Drastic reforms within these agencies have yielded results. Our government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), infamous for high salaries and bonuses being paid their executives and employees, have started to shape up. As of July 9, 2019, we collected more than P61 billion from GOCCs or government corporations, 32% of which, or P16 billion, from PAGCOR. [] This is more than the P36 billion collected in 2017. My salute to Andrea Domingo. [] Magpasugal ka pa, ma’am, nang marami. [] Bureau of Customs, though corruption-ridden, managed to collect Five Hundred Eighty Five Billion Pesos (P585,000,000,000) in 2018. Imagine how much more could have been collected had the BOC been clean and less corrupt.\\nMay I cut and just — magsalita lang ako kung anong sa isip ko. I went to the Bureau of Customs two weeks ago and found out that there were about 63 of them facing charges, criminal charges, and 61 of them under investigation. I hope that I can have the cooperation of Congress if we cannot abolish their position. And if I cannot dismiss them for the reason that there is a security of tenure, I will just allow them to have their plantilla positions but they have to report to Congress everyday to help me in the huge paperwork that we have to do everyday. All of them will go out from the premises of the Customs area. [] I do not want them back.\\nWe, in government, talk too much, act too little, and too slow. I recall saying that before the Congressional hearing when I was Mayor of Davao City. I say that again to emphasize how little we have changed since then. We are long on rhetorics but short on accomplishments. It’s either you Congress or — even the Executive department and maybe me. So I am here to rectify my own error.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is why, I implore those who occupy positions of power and authority, to let your deeds and accomplishments do the talking. Lead by example. Words ring hollow when not followed by positive and prioritized action.\\nTime and again, I have emphasized that like my fellow workers in government, trabahante lang po ako ng Pilipino.\\nLast year, I assign — I signed the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, a significant piece of legislation to improve service delivery and fight corruption, still until now.\\nHowever, much [has] to be done in ensuring our responsiveness to the people’s needs. Based on complaints received by the Contact Center [ng] Bayan, Contact Center [ng] Bayan – — that’s in my office — the LTO, SSS, BIR, LRA, and PAG-IBIG are the top five agencies that need to drastically improve their service.\\nI reiterate my government — my directive to the government and instrumentalities, including the LGUs and the government corporations: simplify. May I… Nandito ba kayo? Simplify. Just like the others. You can do it electronically. You do not have to go to the office.\\nI’ve been asking that from you since three years ago. ‘Pag hindi pa ninyo nagawa ‘yan ngayon, papatayin ko talaga kayo. [] Nabubwisit na…\\nSimplify and make your services responsive to — client-friendly. Your client is the Filipino, our employer — from where the money in our pockets come from, from our salaries.\\nThanks to Executive Secretary Medialdea, we have increased the number of lines [for] Hotline 8888 to make it more responsive to the public. Our ultimate goal is for our people to be freed from using these hotlines because government service and response have markedly improved.\\nAgain, I will… Ang problema kasi ng Fili — I’m addressing now to the Filipino. Kayo rin kasi sinasabi ko na sa inyo, be assertive. At ‘pag kayo o ikaw hiningian more than the required payment by government at humingi pa sa iyo, I’ve been telling you mag-eskandalo kayo sa opisina. Make a scene. Sampalin mo ‘yang p***** i** na ‘yan. [] Kasi aabot rin sa akin ‘yan. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd I have done that. Ako mag-prangka ako sa inyo, ako lang ang Presidente na hanggang ngayon nagbubugbog talaga ng tao diyan sa loob ng Malacañan.\\nPinapakain ko ng pera ‘yang mga y*** na ‘yan. Eh galit na ako sa inyo eh. Kindly be assertive. Pagka hiningian ka, sabihin mo, “T*** *** mo. Sabi ni Duterte, the President told us, that if you extort money from me, I will slap you.”\\nAt sampalin talaga ninyo. Hindi na bale magkaaway. I will defend you. At kung maaari and this is what I’ve been doing all along. There’s an [8888]. Be sure that it is true. Though you are not liable for libel pero huwag naman ‘yang makasakit ka ng kapwa-tao na wala namang kasalanan. [8888], then place “To President Duterte, re: abuses by the director asking for money.” Text mo, lalabas ‘yan diyan. And that is for the public to view.\\nAt kung totoo, Malacañan, I said, is open 24 hours — 24 hours basta corruption. And that is why that fiasco about the frigate ni Trillanes was because ‘yung Koreano na napagbili ng barko, who sold the ship to the Philippine government, wala pa hong delivery. And it was there already ready.\\nAnd that is why that Korean went to Malacañan just to complain why is it that there is no request for delivery. So I told Bong, “Bong, ayusin mo ‘yan.” He went to Lorenzana and Lorenzana nagsulat siya. May nakakuha because sa Malacañan, every administration may tao ‘yan diyan. Every administration leaves some of the men because they are appointed on plantilla position.\\nEh kinuha nila then it was brought here, before the Congress. And so Bong was called to testify. And he said, he was assured it will be a closed-door. I told Bong, “No, ask for an open and public hearing.”\\nSabi ko, “Sabihin mo sa lahat — wala — you have nothing. Just say the truth.” Sabi ko, pagkatapos niya testify, sabi ko, “Bong, maniwala ka hindi, you will be a senator.” [] Totoo ‘yan. That is the story of how convoluted politics and corruption here in our country works.\\nEquipped with political will, the government ordered the closure of Boracay Island for six months to prevent its further deterioration. We cleaned and rehabilitated the island and I allowed it to heal naturally. I am proud to say that it has been restored close to its original pristine state. Boracay Inter- Agency Task Force led by Secretary Cimatu, and fully supported by Secretaries Año, Romulo-Puyat — Oh what’s her name? Puro surname ito,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRomulo-Puyat. What’s her name? Ah si — ah Berna. Ah, Berna Romulo-Puyat, Bello and Villar, and then TESDA Chief Mamondiong for this huge success. Kudos are also due to the PMS for integrating the six-month Rehabilitation Plan, and the NEDA for the recently-approved [Medium]-term Boracay Action Plan. []\\nBoracay Island is just the beginning. And the girls there, the foreigners are waiting for you gentlemen to visit the place. They are all on the beach sunbathing. You are invited to — I have not been there.\\nAlam mo, nung naayos ‘yan, day before we were told that there’s gonna be an opening tomorrow. So on the TV on that day, Magandang Hapon, showed a lot of buntings and banners, “Salamat Duterte.” So when I saw it, I called the military and the police, “Remove the buntings. I am not going there.” No need to really arbi — ah advertise. I am paid for what I’m doing. Nakokornihan ako. Too much adulation, bordering pretentions. I can always smell it a mile away.\\nAnd I never went there until now. What I did was I went to the other side of the island and asked the DAR, “What is the status of the land behind the beach of Boracay?” And they are still categorized as forestal and agriculture. “Not…” I said, “Not commercial?” “No, sir.”\\nSo I told the Agrarian Reform, “Go to the place, have it inspected because I will declare the whole of the island a land reform program.” And I gave the islands piece by piece to the Atis, the natives of the place para walang masabi. Marami kasi ginawa ko raw [] para linisan ko, ibigay ko sa mga kaibigan ko.\\nWala akong kaibigang mayaman. Ayaw kong kaibigan ng mayaman because pagka mayaman ka, tatabi ka lang sa akin, pati ako napahiran na ng kung ano-ano ang hingiin mo sa gobyerno.\\nThere are those who violate environmental rules. I am giving due notice to the LGUs and other stakeholders, kayo po, of tourist destinations to take extra steps in the enforcement of our laws and the protection of our environment.\\nOn January 27, 2019, we officially started the Manila Bay rehabilitation. Though we have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the test results of the waters near Padre Faura. We will relocate informal settlers — I hope it can happen during my time — along the waterways and shut down establishments that continue to pollute and poison our waters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake a choice. I’m going to the… [Malaki ba ‘yung building diyan?] I’m going to dismantle your burning — ah building — or just simply burn it down so that we can have a new set-up of environmental friendly, whatever that means.\\nThrough the Build, Build, Build Program in emerging economic hubs outside Metro Manila. This will swiftly gain ground, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Team led by Secretary Dominguez. Hard at work in the interconnection of our islands and cities by air, land, and sea are Secretaries Tugade and Villar.\\nAlam naman ninyo. Magaganda na ang airport ninyo. Inuna ko nga kayo eh. Everybody’s complaining about the Davao airport and I said, “Davao will be the last.” Kung hindi na maabutan, sabi ko mga taga-Davao, pasensya na kayo. Para walang masabi ang Congress sa atin, baka nga 3% sila doon sa kabila.\\nWe also paved the way for the entry of third telecommunications provider. Do not worry about this. There is no corruption at all. I guarantee you, upon the grave of my father. I do not allow — I do not talk to them. I just say: Just do your work. And kung maaari, according to what the specifications are required by this government.\\nI challenge this new player to fulfill its commitment to provide fast and reliable telecommunication services to our people, especially in the underserved areas. DICT Secretary Honasan will be the lead man in this endeavor. I hope he is here. []\\nHowever, developmental gains will not be felt by our people in the countryside if we cannot maintain law and order. ‘Yang peace and security, wala ‘yan. We need to enforce the law.\\nAfter almost two decades of peace negotiation, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was finally passed and ratified.\\nFor decades, our Muslim brothers in the ARMM have been mired in poverty. My late Muslim brother, MinDA Chair Abdul Khayr Alonto, envisioned a progressive, peaceful, and united Mindanao during our lifetime. It is my hope that the Bangsamoro Transition will fast-track the establishment of regional government that will secure and comfortable life for Muslim brothers and sisters, and all indigenous communities in the Bangsamoro Regions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, I have taken the helm of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict and have assigned a Cabinet member to each region to harmonize government efforts in attaining national development [and] security.\\nThrough the exceptional leadership of Secretary Briones and the DepEd, I am proud to say that this year more Filipino learners are receiving basic education, with over 27 million enrollees from Kinder to Senior High School. []\\nAnd because we have still a little to spare, the fastest population growth, one of the — is the Philippines. We are so industrious that we are producing more people than… [] I do not want to quarrel with the religious but…\\nMore than [823,000] — sorry my eyes is not good — for the… Isinusuot ko lang ‘to ‘pag mag — paminsan-minsan eh. Out-of-school youth and adult learners were able to access non-formal education through the Alternative Learning System. For our national sports development, I support the proposed measure to create the National Academy of Sports for High School students. []\\nAlmost 86,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises or the MSMEs have received over P3 billion worth of loans since 2017, thanks to the efforts of Secretary Lopez and the DTI.\\nAdditional benefits for solo parents, [] the assignment of health workers in all barangays, and the expansion of the Malasakit Centers, are what we also hope to achieve through the bills filed by the original concept of Bong Go. [] Para manalo sa kampanya, ‘yon ang mantra niya. Totohanin mo lang, Bong, mapahiya tayong lahat. []\\nI also implore Congress… You — look. You have to study this very carefully. Congress has to postpone the May 2020 elections and ‘yung Barangay, Sangguniang Kabataan to October 2022. Because if you read it, this… [] To rectify the truncated terms. Paiba-iba na eh. The truncated terms of sitting barangays but also provide them with the ample time to finish their programs and projects. I suggest Congress should also enact the Magna Carta for Barangays. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Administration’s malasakit at serbisyo program has, of course, reached the Filipinos who labor in foreign lands. The milestone signing of the Bilateral Labor Agreement with Kuwait in 2018 is a testament of my commitment to stop abuses inflicted on our overseas Filipinos. To ensure their welfare, protection and their access to government services, the establishment of the Department of Overseas Filipinos will sufficiently address this particular need. []\\nOur accomplishments for the past three years and the plans for the next three are discussed in detail in my mid-term report to the people, copies of which shall be made available before the day ends.\\nLet me repeat what I said many times before. Honestly, I have identified the enemy who dumped us into this quagmire we are in. I have met the enemy face-to-face and sadly, the enemy is “us.” We are our own tormentors — addressing the Filipino people — we are our own demons; we are as rapacious predators preying on the helpless, the weak and the voiceless. We find corruption everywhere in government with every malefactor watching his cohort’s back in blatant disregard of his oath when he assumed public office. Even the language has evolved to soften the wickedness of the criminal act. “For the Boys”, “sponsoring an event” or what-else-have-you. No amount of euphemism can trivialize or normalize betrayal of public trust or any other criminal offense. It is an injury laced with insult. It is both a national embarrassment and a national shame.\\nFor every transaction, a commission; for every action, extortion; and a request that goes on and on – endlessly and shamelessly.\\nCatharsis is what we, individually and collectively, need to do today – not tomorrow but today. Self-purgation followed by the resolve to do what is right and proper, is good for the nation’s health.\\nLet me ask you: When will corruption end? Kailan ba talaga ‘to? Hanggang kailan? Well, I don’t know. I’ve been in — with government for almost 35 years now. I am not singling out myself. It’s the entire gamut of our system.\\nCorruption exasperates. It frustrates. It is also exasperating that there are times when I think that perhaps it is blood that we need to cleanse and rinse away the dirt and the muck that stick to the flesh like leeches.\\nOf course, it is only a thought. I am simply thinking aloud. To dispel any controversy that my statements in this regard will create something else. Words of Pedro Guerrero who said, “Sometimes they write what I say and they write — and they write what I say and not what I mean.” So ‘yung mga pa-purga-purga lang diyan. I use similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and other figures of speech every now and then, to prove or stress a point. I am as human as anybody else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the matter of the Philippine — West Philippine Sea. The avoidance of conflict — armed conflict and protection of our territorial waters and natural resources compel us to perform a delicate balancing act. A shooting war is grief and misery multiplier. War leaves widows and orphans in its wake. I am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction, more widows and more orphans, should war, even on a limited scale, breaks out. More and better results can be reached in the privacy of a conference room than in a squabble in public. That is why I will do in the peaceful way, mindful of the fact that it is our national pride and territorial integrity that are at stake.\\nShort of expressly advocating a call to arms, there are those who say that we should stand up and stop those who fish in our economic zone. Of course we will do in due time. There is…\\nAlam mo ganito ‘yan eh. Noong — when I became President and when the M16 rifles were cancelled by America upon the prodding of the US Congress, I found myself in a quandary because reports were already very ripe na there was the passing of arms in Marawi.\\nAnd because of the arms were already — mostly in the hands of the police, hands-me-down from the army were quite old and sometimes the bolt that pushes the bullet flies out and the barrel has really become lose, and there are no more launch and planes to push it into a circular trajectory to maintain its accuracy.\\nSo I was forced to go to China. Eh mabuti’t na lang nasabi ko sa inyo ‘to. Then in China, we had a bilateral. I brought along the military man — Año, the chief of staff then, and all of them, Lorenzana, Esperon, National Security.\\nIn that meeting, I said — Cabinet members were there — “I want to go to my territory to dig oil.” That was the word, “I dig.” Because that is ours. Ang sabi ni President Xi, “Well, you know there is a conflict there. Do you think, rather than go there and have a confrontation — not necessarily the grey ships, war ships. But you know a squabble there could lead to something else.” Sabi niya, we just became friends. And perhaps we can talk about this. But not an outright precipitate move because… He said it softly, “It can mean trouble.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf the trouble comes out from the mouth of a president of a republic, anong magawa ko? So what did I answer? “Well then maybe, sir, we can talk about this at some other time.” But definitely, before I go, we must talk about the West Philippine Sea. We cannot you know, have our cake and eat it too.\\nYou know, I cannot go there even to bring the Coast Guard to drive them away. China also claims the property and he is in possession. ‘Yan ang problema. Sila ‘yung in possession and claiming all the resources there as an owner. We are claiming the same but we are not in the position because of that fiasco noong dalawang nag-standoff doon during the time of my predecessor si Albert, ambassador. If I’m correct. I do not know his real name. Tayo ang umatras. Pagsabi niya umatras, that was a kind of a compromise. Tayo ang umatras. Noong umatras tayo, pumasok sila. Marami na.\\nThat day, we lost the Spratly and the Panganiban Island. Iyan ang totoo. Walang bolahan ‘yan. Ngayon, may arbitral ruling. I… I said, I could not even ask for the oil claiming the entire resources of the…\\nAnong sabihin ko sa kanila? Kaya sinabi ko, “Let us do this mutually.” Of course, when Xi says, “I will fish,” who can prevent him? And sabi ko naman, “We will fish because we claim it.”\\nAnd sabi ko, “Please allow because…” Before that, they were driving away our fishermen. ‘Di ba inaabog nila? Kaya sabi ko, “Do not drive them away because the Filipinos are of the belief that they are also — they claim it.”\\nNow, if you deprive — deprive the Filipinos of — there, magkagulo talaga ‘yan. And it could lead to ano — not really war, and I said, “we have to…”\\nKaya ang sabi ko… When I said, “I allowed,” that was on the premise that I own the property. Pero hindi tayo in control of the property. Ayan magsabi sila, “Of course, I will allow you.” Kaya pinabalik.\\nEh ‘yung disgrasya, ‘yung pagsabi “a mere incident — legal, marine incident,” ‘yan ang ginagamit sa batas ‘yan, “a marine incident happened.” Hindi naman sinasabi na “marine accident.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was just nabanggan, wala naman. So they wanted to talk, tapos ayaw dito. And so, “So sige, we will investigate and you investigate, and when you are ready, we should meet and compare notes, and let us determine who pays for what damage.”\\nGanun lang. Ipadala ko ‘yung marines ko to drive away the Chinese fishermen. I guarantee you, not one of them will come home alive.\\nKung ipadala ko ‘yung limang — pati ‘yung frigate ko na bago, ‘yung pinagkaguluhan nila ni Trillanes diyan sa — that made Bong a Senator, ubos ‘yan because there are already guided missiles in that island.\\nAnd the fastest that they have installed there can reach Manila in seven minutes. You want war? Alam mo, asaran ‘yan eh. Supladuhan ‘yan. Kung supladuhan lang, murahin, “P***** i** mo, l**** ka. Umalis ka diyan.”\\nKung ganunan lang, bright ako diyan. Hanggang bunganga lang. Pero kung bunutan na ng baril, ah pwede siguro basta dalawa lang. But the problem is, there — whether we do it in a diplomatic way, there will be heated arguments, sigurado ‘yan.\\nWe do it in a confrontation doon. We try to drive them away, it could lead to a violence. Any way ‘yan. By the way the President answered when I said “I will dig my oil” the first time I went to China.\\nNakita ko ‘yung tao eh. So you can, more or less, draw a profile of his, “Please do not do that because there will be trouble.” Ano… Anong magagawa ko?\\nI go there, I said, “The fisheries who were…” And besides, I was invoking ‘yung traditional fishing rights. It is in that arbitral ruling. Ayaw lang ninyong gustong tignan.\\nIt is mentioned there that even before countries were in existence, people around an ocean or a lake had already been fishing there for generations. And that is why fishing rights are allowed in the so many cases between Finland and Germany, decided by UNCLOS — UNCLOS and the International Law of the Seas.\\nUNCLOS is a product of a treaty. That treaty is also a part of our land because we are a signatory. Eh kung basahin lang ninyo ‘yan nang husto, it is there. You might just…\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChina and everybody recognizes traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments. That law is a humane law.\\nSo I’m sorry I have to… I promised you 40 minutes. My God, I… You want me to stop? We can go home now. [] I have exceeded my… There is the, you know, there is a time for everything.\\nDo not believe the others because they are not my friends. They are my political enemies. They said I do not believe in God. Who says? I am a believer of a universal mind there.\\nBut [] I do not believe that a God so perfect would create hell for his creation. What kind of God is he? He is not my God. There is a time to — for everything. A time to negotiate and a time to quarrel with your enemy, with your political opponents or with your wife.\\nThat is why some lives here are… And a time to antagonize and a time to make peace and a time to go to war, and a time to live and a time to die. That’s Ecclesiastes 3.\\nOur ownership of the Philippine — West Philippine Sea is internationally recognized. However, both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arbitral Award in the case of People — “Republic of the Philippines vs. People’s Republic of China” recognize instances where another state may utilize the resources found within the coastal state’s Exclusive Economic Zone.\\nThe arbitral ruling even states, the one that they are charging me for violating the Constitution…. Sino gani ‘yon? Suntukin lang kita diyan ngayon mabuti pa. Nandito eh. The arbitral ruling even states that the Philippines may enter into fishing agreements with other states, provided certain conditions and requisites in the UNCLOS are met.\\nSo ‘yung akin, sabi niya, “Let’s go fish.” Sabi ko, “You have to act…” You know, they have been there fishing since time immemorial. I think it was Adam who got the first Lapu-Lapu there.\\nLet me assure you, that national honor and territorial integrity shall not — shall be foremost in our mind, and when we may take the next steps in this\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsmoldering controversy over the lines of arbitral ruling, the West Philippine Sea is ours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no ifs and buts. It is ours. But we have been acting, [] along that legal truth and line. But we have to temper it with the times and the realities that we face today.\\nPoverty incidence fell from 27.6 percent in the first half of 2015 to 21 percent in the first half of 2018. The most important number, though, is the six million Filipinos we need to pull out from poverty. Kindly help me on this.[]\\nAnd you know, as I said, corruption is everywhere. You are free to investigate. I don’t take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime.\\nYou do not have to call me. Call the idiots, expose them, and send them to jail. You are helping me. Do not be… I am not… I’ve been a prosecutor. I know how it works. Feel free. Feel free to expose anything that is not in accordance with law.\\nWe have pursued tax reforms to fund our poverty reduction programs. I therefore implore Congress to immediately pass Package 2 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, or the TRABAHO Bill, which shall gradually lower the income — corporate income tax, and rationalize and improve fiscal incentives.\\nIt will energize our MSMEs and encourage them to expand their business and hopefully generate, hopefully — I’m missing the word hopefully para sabihin na “you’re all talk” — hopefully [1.4] million jobs in the coming years. The MSMC — MSMEs hold the promise of raising a lot of the Filipinos.\\nI therefore believe that it is now time for Congress to approve a new version of the Salary Standardization Law. Ngayon na. [] And to the teachers, alam mo dito who toil and work tirelessly to educate our young.\\nKasali na po dito ‘yung hinihingi ninyo. Hindi naman masyadong malaki, pero it will tide you over during these hard times. A little bit bigger than before. [] This is intended to increase the salaries of national government workers, including teachers and nurses. Nurses, correct. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI am also asking Congress to pass the remaining packages of my Administration’s Tax Reform Program, and the bills that would further raise excise taxes on — very good, let us do it — tobacco and alcohol.\\nSinong naninigarilyo dito? They should be exterminated from the face of the earth. [] They are the ones… You know, I… I’m… I do not hide my-\\n— what’s wrong with me. I acquired Buerger’s disease because I smoke.\\nBut I made it a national policy because you know when I was new mayor, I went around to see the discos and night clubs. I could hardly see the faces of the people inside. You have to wade into a thick smoke to just recognizeone.\\nSo that’s when I decided. But I was still smoking. But I decided because I knew, I already had it. So it’s time to — sabi ko. And a national law, para lahat na, that at 12 o’ clock, everything closes.\\nI am not trying to pull a chair here. Mine was that two o’clock noon sa Davao, it was two then I reduced it to one. When that boxing mayor there became mayor, she reduced it to six. Walang order, no orders in advance.\\nKasi we have ordered already, so you can close but we have to drink. Itong ngayon, at 12, everything closes down. Nobody works. So I… I think that we should adopt it. Most of the states, in many states, in many countries, ganun man. Alas dose, sarado na talaga.\\nWe have to stop drinking. And jukebox, they’re only good up to eight, nine. Eight, maganda ‘yan. It’s a… It’s there in every corner, store. Blares out noise and the children who will go to school and the working class, and you are there with your store.\\nI have prohibited it in Davao. And at 12, as you see, Davao is quiet because everybody is resting already. Be it in the memorial parks, cemetery, or inthe comfort of their homes.\\nThe valuation system has also to be improved local government units and rationalize capital income [taxation]. I urge Congress to review and pass the Government Rightsizing Bill to reconfigure the existing Metro Manila-centric bureaucracy; streamline government systems in order to deliver services without delay and within a short timeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese reforms would be for naught if we cannot avert of a “new poor” every time a disaster strikes. The Philippine experience has shown that natural disasters and — are poverty creators.\\nThat is why, we need to hasten the establishment of a Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) so that these department focus on the natural hazards and climate change. I urge Congress to fast-track the passage of the Administration of this bill — Administration version rather. In 2017, I reminded all of you of the probable consequence of a catastrophic earthquake in Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces. Since then, I have established the Project Management Office for the Earthquake Resilience and the Greater Manila Area to implement two-pronged strategy on earthquake resilience and mitigation efforts.\\nI just heard, it’s not in my speech. I just heard that from a psychic that the first crack when the “Big One” hits, will be right here in the center of\\nthis… [ and ]\\n‘Yan man ang sabi nila. “Philippines is so corrupt, it’s so lousy that if you kill all congressmen, senators and the president, we will have a new\\nday.” [] So I pray that if the earthquake comes, it comes now. This moment. [] Kumpleto na tayo. May madamay pa tayo doon sa harap. []\\nWe weathered one damaging effect of climate change this year. The El Niño were wreaked havoc in the agricultural sector and caused water shortage in the greater Metro Manila area. We need to pass bill creating the Department of Water Resources and Water Regulatory Commission. []\\nAlam mo, the agencies and the guys there handling the — the entire water works system — you have to change it immediately.\\nYou know what, there was this three-day no water. I was in Davao. So everybody was complaining and I was even afraid to come here because what if my girlfriend will not be able to – — to take a bath. [] She will smell like hell. So I said, I’ll wait for the water to wash her.\\nAlam mo kung hindi ako nagmura, kung hindi ko sinabi, “p**** i**, papatayin ko kayo, p**** i** niyo.” And then when I arrived in the morning, there was water. And my girlfriend was fresh. []\\nI also call on Congress to pass a law mandating a Fire Protection Modernization Program. Diyan tayo nagka-ano. If you go to Davao, you’ll\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfind the best. The best of everything, 911, all the cameras, all the screens. We did that if you can find it.\\nAlam mo — alam mo sabi ni… Is there… Sonny is here? Secretary Dominguez? Ah Sonny. Siya man ang magyayabang. Sabi niya, “marami tayong pera”. Pero ‘pag tanungin namin siya doon sa Cabinet meeting, “tsk tsk tsk tsk, walang pera, walang pera”. [] Si Diokno ganun rin kaya gi-tapon ko sa Central Bank. []\\nEvery time sabihin mo, you know we discussed projects, we plan and we submit it to Congress, it’s final imprimatur. Eh ‘di kami ang, “May pera ba tayo diyan, sir? “Wala.” “Magkano?” “Four billion.” “Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk that is not the tsk tsk practice. No money, no money.” P***. Saan pala ang pera natin dito? Sa bulsa ninyo? [] Karaming collection natin dito. But Sonny says that we can fund. This one we have to answer.\\nNow, I would like to remind… Pagbigyan na lang ninyo ako tutal para naman ito sa lahat. Alas- sais pa nga ginugutom na kayo. Hindi pala kayo nag- merienda?\\nAlam mo, ever since na-integrate ‘yan you would notice in your cities and provinces the deterioration of the service itself. Wala ng mga truck, luma na. And would you believe it in Davao City, I’ll show it to you, we have a\\n1934 Studebaker fire truck. Maganda pa.\\nSo we have to — we have to do better than this. There are other cities which are utterly — – utterly without the tools to respond the challenges of fire. We have to come up with something that is really good.\\nI mean at this age, it would be a shame if you cannot put up a fire in two days, three days, my God. We have to set aside.\\nSonny, you have the money? [] Oh yes. Oh see. Basta sa maraming tao mahiya man mag-deny. [] Totoo ‘yan. Totoo ‘yan. We have the money so maybe Sonny can give you a figure that we can set aside.\\nNakakahiya talaga itong ano natin. Ang Davao, meron. Davao has a very good 911. Hindi ako nagyayabang. And we have cameras in every corners that’s why we can solve crimes immediately. And meron kaming 911. “What is your emergency?” That’s the standard. So it’s fire, they call the fire department.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSabi ko, “911.” “Yes.” “What’s your emergency?” “I — I seemed to lost my –\\n— to have lost my girlfriend.” “We know you, Mayor. You go back to Manila there are plenty left there. Go.” []\\nThis will equip the fire — Bureau of Fire Protection with tools to respond to the challenges. I further ask Congress to urgently pass the Na — ito — the National Land Use Act or NALUA within this year. [] Paki lang po. So that we can proceed with the new… Well, we can meet the — the demands of the new investors coming in. Ang lupa natin ang problema eh.\\nA science-based national land use plan would serve as basis for the LGUs in crafting respective development plans, and help disperse economic activities to the countryside.\\nThe dispersion of economic and business activities to Visayas and Mindanao is not just a campaign promise. It is an economic imperative and a key to our country’s sustainable and equitable development. We will encourage investments that would develop the rural areas and Metro Manila and other mega urban areas.\\nLet me cut here, tutal maliit na lang. I would just like to remind everybody. No offense intended to the mayors and governors to the local government. Pero ‘yang style ninyo na it takes about three days, four days for the employees of a certain company, store, or whatever to go back and forth, back and forth.\\nWhen they go back, you have a new regulation. He gets it, he secures it and when he goes back, oh there’s still you have to follow — you have to get this paper.\\nI will tell you now. Hindi ako nagyayabang. In Davao, it’s one hour unless there is a need for ocular inspection. I am directing you publicly mayors — mayors. I am directing also the DILG, Secretary Año of the local government to see to it that this is honored. All clearances, permits emanating from your office that would need also your approval, must be out at the very least within three days. []\\nYou do not do that. I am directing si Secretary Año, is he here, sir? Nandito ka? Oh Secretary Año, he is the former chief of staff, he’s also a military man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI want three days, unless there is an exceptional reason, three days, para hindi na magpa- balik-balik kasi diyan ang perahan eh. Pagdating doon meron na naman hingin, pagdating doon may hingin.\\nKaya I said the Filipinos if it is done to you, I’m telling you, slap the guy, create a scene, create a scandal because that incident however little will reach me. And if it does, you can be sure, if I do not call you and the idiot, I will go there myself. That is a promise, that is a pledge. []\\nMake it a part of my oath of office. Lahat kayo diyan pati ‘yang tsk — easement. Well, under Villar, okay na. Pero ‘yang easement billion dollar — ah billion pesos. Well, if it’s a foreign company, it’s a billion dollar thing.\\nGanun ‘yan. Pabalik-balik at hindi binabayaran. That’s why nagpatong… If all moneys and revenues due government are collected in good faith, marami tayong pera. I’m telling you as President. Marami tayong pera para extra money to uplift the — the mass of Filipinos who are suffering. Maski ospital lang and housing.\\nJobs, it’s the economy that runs it. If the economy is good, more jobs. At the meantime, itong hospitalization, education, the basic things at saka itong relocation. Kaawa talaga.\\nKung makolekta lang lahat hindi ma-corrupt ang pera, marami tayong pera. Kaya ako nagsabi. That’s why I — I resi…\\nYou know, I will make it public. I was at the Nayong Pilipino. I gave it to a group of people. Tapos nagpa-bidding sila. Ang nagbidding nila is to allow a gambling casino to be erected there inside the Nayong Pilipino.\\nKaya ko nagsabi t*** i** ninyo. Anong kahulugan ng Nayong Pilino kung lagyan mo ng sugalan and without a bidding? You know, nandiyan na ‘yung mga generals, they are there, chief of staff. Kasi pag galing doon pumunta ako sa command conference. Pagdating ko sa command conference, may ipinasa si Sonny ghost delivery sa AFP hospital. Eh galing pa ako doon sa…\\nWhen I was facing the military and police, sabi ko, “Look, I thought I had my back covered by you? If I cannot trust you, you better tell me now. Because if you the commanders of the Air Force, Army pati Albayalde and the Navy, I\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwill step down now. I am resigning, I’ll go back to Davao. You do the explaining to the people why.”\\nGinanun ko talaga. And in one of the Cabinet meetings ganun rin. There was this two-year, pabalik-balik na ‘yung — back and forth, back and forth, for two years it was sitting on their ass, the papers.\\nSo when they were explaining to me the revised plan and with so many requirements, clearances from NBI, I stood up with the Cabinet members, lahat kami. In a Cabinet meeting I said, “Stop. That idiotic matrix is not for me. That is intended for the next — maybe the president after the next.” Lumabas ako sabi ko, “Inyo na ‘yang gobyerno ninyo.”\\nSabi ko wala ako… I — I’m tired. I’m tired and I am… Talagang gusto ko na rin mag-resign. Sabi ko I am not happy anymore. Sabi ko anytime — ah the military said, if you want to go out? If you want to take over coup d’etat, go ahead. Do not bring your armors. Do not bring your weapons here. Just call me and we’ll have coffee.\\nI do not believe. I think Marcos and Estrada were correct that they did not allow the… Kasi ‘yung guwardiya mo, guwardiya dito, pareho ‘yan. Lahat sila dadaan ‘yan sa presidential command. All of them will be assigned. Nag- iikot ‘yan sila lahat. A taste of everything. Hanggang Mindanao kaya kilala ko ‘yan sila lahat dumaan ng Mindanao eh.\\nSabi ko talaga, “Inyo na. Ayaw ko na.” Sabi ko, “Sige, sinong gusto? Raise your right hands. I…” “I…” “Duly appointed member of the junta, will now make the SONA next month.”\\nAh bahala kayo diyan. You threatened about… If you think that you can run the country better than the elected one, go ahead. That’s not my — it’s the problem of the Filipino people.\\nTalaga sa Cabinet na — na tsk… Kaya abutan ako ng topak, magbaba dito ako ngayon. Bahala na kayo diyan. I’m going home.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne ese — one estimate pegs economic losses at P3.5 billion a day due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila. So meantime, I reiterate my directive, my request, my pleadings to the MMDA and all concerned local officials in Metro Manila, and all other cities, to undertake immediate action to ensure the speedy and smooth flow of vehicular traffic. Reclaim all public roads that are being used for private ends. Marami diyan. []\\nAnd again, I asked Secretary Año to see to it that this is enforced. If there is a mayor or a governor, or kung ano kang — sino kang demonyo ka, i- suspend mo Sir Año. Give him time and if he cannot — if he is not up to it, then pagpahingain mo na lang. Suspend mo na. Wala talagang — wala tayong magawa.\\nThey just keep on pleasing their own constituents just because they are constituents — a leader. Ganun kayo eh. The only way to do it… Anyway, me, I have no problem. Me, I am an inutil official. Me, I cannot run anymore. Me, after six years I might lose my head. Wala na ako. I… No more challenges in politics. No more mountains to climb. I will just do my duty.\\nAnd most of my Cabinet members are actually military men. You know why? Gusto ninyong malaman? Do not be embarrassed. Atin-atin na lang ito.\\nHuwag mo na silang pansinin, ‘yang mga ano diyan. Parang nag meeting- meeting lang tayo dito. [] ‘Yung parang nagpulung-pulong lang. Do not mind them. Eh kung tignan kasi ninyo mahiya kayo.\\nKasi ganito ‘yan, my penchant for military men. I want to ingratiate myself to them? What? I was elected by the people, not by the military, not by the police. But to — why do I have this I said — this predisposed of… Kasi utusan sila madali. Kasi ‘pag sinabi mong walang corruption, walang corruption. Kaya lang ang military and just like any organization, ‘pag ang top diyan general o ang commander-in-chief corrupt, ku-corrupt ‘yan lahat.\\nPero kung sabihin mo na matino ka, they will follow. So Boracay I\\nsent Cimatu. Sabi ko, “Puntahan mo nga doon.” Is General Cimatu here, si Roy? Ah yeah.\\nItong si Roy nakilala ko ito sa Mindanao. Hindi ko man ‘yan kilala. Mindanao… Na-mayor kasi ako 23 years. So all of them passed by Mindanao, kilala ko. ‘Pag inutusan mo, kaagad. And they know that I will not\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngive illegal orders for them to implement. Alam nila abugado ako. Sabi ko sundin lang ako ninyo.\\nKaya I was surprised when I ordered Cimatu to go there — to Boracay, Sir Frank. Alam mo ang ginawa niya? The next day lumabas siya roon sa Daily Mirror. Naglalakad siya doon sa beach, naka-t-shirt ng blue at ‘yung mata niya nandoon sa dalawang Caucasian na nag… []\\n“G****** it, Cimatu. Akala ko ba inutusan kita?” “Yes, sir.” “O bakit ka nagpalakad-lakad diyan sa beach tinitignan mo ‘yung naka-bikini na dalawang puti?” “Sir, napadaan lang ako sir.” Sabi ko, “Trabahuin mo ‘yan ha.” And they did it in six months’ time. Of course with a… [] I like Cimatu because he mixed his pleasure with\\nwork. [] That is the way how to do it. []\\nI give you until the last week of the year ‘yung sa — September na to do this. Clean the\\nLGUs. Walang mangyari dito.\\nWe shall continue to invest in the countryside through agricultural programs that will increase the productivity and income of our small farmers and fisherfolk. We shall ensure the full implementation of the Rice Tariffication Law, including the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund. This will safeguard the livelihood of small farmers through the provisions of modern farm equipment and machineries, seeds and credit, and extension services.\\nI also have not forgotten my commitment to uplift the lives — ito — coconut farmers and further develop the coconut industry until the urgent —\\n– ah through the urgent utilization of the Coconut Levy Fund. That is 100 million. [] Kaya ako very careful until now wala akong nakuha. Look, it is really hard to look for an\\nhonest man. I must admit it. Baka ako hindi ko rin kaya. I do not have that well…\\nItong coco fund na ito, ito ‘yung naiwan sa — noong kay Marcos na levy fund. This is sacred money. This money was taken out of the pockets of the Filipinos arbitrarily. Wala kang magawa noon eh martial law. Ito na ‘yan.\\nKaya itong coco levy fund, kung sabihin mo lang, tama ang Supreme Court. Hindi mo pwedeng maibigay — sabi mo sino. You can no longer trace the truthful owner of the land.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAng plano ko, kung gusto ninyo, you save the money. You invest the money. Siguro mag-abot ‘yan ng mga more than 100 billion. Ilagay na lang ninyo ng ano trust fund for the government. It’s about mga 5 billion. Ayon na lang ang gastusin ninyo to reserve the money. Rather than do it parang sprinkle na ibigay mo sa mga tao. You cannot — sabi ng Supreme Court tama sila —\\n– you can no longer trace the genealogy of the owners — the original owners. And\\nsometimes it would fail.\\nI will not act on that until I find the money. Wala pa akong nakuha. I have yet — I have yet to look for the money. Hanggang ngayon naghahanap ako. Wala akong makita. Kasi malaki ito and this will — this will, you know, if you assign a corrupt idiot there. Kaya gusto — ang gusto ko o baka nagustuhan rin ninyo, i-deposito ko na lang. Let it remain as a remembrance to the people who lost their ah — at that time. Tapos ‘yung 5 billion, ‘yon ‘yung to improve the econo — the improvement sa replanting sa coconut.\\nFive billion, that’s a big money. Pero kung ibigay mo, let it sprinkler, walang mangyayari. ‘Yung taga-bigay kukuha ‘yan — ‘yung pupunta. That’s why itong Land Bank na ito, ‘pag hindi ito na… You know, you are called Land Bank but you are now the number one commercial bank in the Philippines.\\nWhat the heck is happening to you? You are supposed to finance agricultural enterprises and endeavors. Bakit wala? [] Bakit — why can’t you just buy a few wagons or whatever? Go to the countryside and ask the people if there are cooperatives, tulungan ninyo to form one. []\\n‘Pag wala, eh tignan ninyo na maibigay ninyo for replanting of the coconut —\\n– to revive the coconut industry. Pahiramin ninyo ng pera plus the money — ‘nung sabi ko of the coconut levy. That is sacred money. Land Bank should go back to land. Why are you mired in so many commercial transactions?\\nBumalik kayo where you were created for and that is to help the farmers. Ilang administration na wala? [] You better decide on that, I will give you until the end of July to give me a plan or else I will ask Congress to reconfigure you what-not. Wala eh, wala kayong… []\\nI’m asking now Congress, ‘pag wala sila — if there is no viable plan for that for the farmers and it is just all commercial transactions, might as well abolish it and give the money to the congressmen for their development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfunds. [] O mas makatulong pa. Diretso eh. Ayaw\\nninyo? [] O ayaw daw nila, Sir Frank. Huwag mo na lang galawin.\\nI once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a more responsive version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund to ensure the accelerated utilization of coco levy funds for the well-being and empowerment of the coconut farmers. []\\nWe recognize the urgent need to ensure the sustainability and availability of resources and the development of alternative ones. In this regard, I trust that Secretary Cusi shall fast-track also the development of renewable energy sources, and reduce dependence on the traditional energy sources such as coal.\\nFinally, sustaining our gains entails a national security posture capable of defending the country from external and internal security threats. Defense Secretary Lorenzana, together with the gallant men and women of the armed forces, is at the forefront of this fight.\\nWe expect support for legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening defense- related systems such as the proposed National Defense Act, the Unified Military and Uniformed Personnel Separation, Retirement, and Pension Bill, and the revival of the mandatory ROTC in Grades 11 and 12. []\\nVery important. Alam mo ‘pag mag giyera-giyera, 10 out of 10 hindi marunong maghawak ng baril to defend even his father and mother and brothers and sisters. Itong mga bata ngayon, they are bereft of the patriotism and the love of country. Balik sila dito.\\nI think a military training would be good for everybody. Kung hindi sige lang\\n— sa shabu, mamaya namatay, krrrkkk. “Duterte: Extrajudicial killing. Report to the ICC.” Ah okay. If you can provide me with a good comfortable cell, heated during winter time, I want to go — and an air-conditioned during hot weather. And a conjugal visits, unlimited, [] para we can understand each other.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are aware of the fact that there are times in AFP and PNP personnel, while in the performance of their duties, get unjustly sued. Providing them with free legal assistance to help and boost their morale.\\nMy fellow citizens, to borrow the words of Churchill — akin ‘to, this is mine: We are now entering a period of consequences. The consequences of what we did and did not do but should have done during my first half of my term. I assume full responsibility for that. As President, I cannot pass it — the blame to anybody. So it’s on me.\\nThough we cannot change the past, we will not squander the future. I will push harder in the pursuit of programs that we have started, but always within the parameters of the law. I will not merely coast along or while away my time during the remaining years of my administration. It ain’t my style. [] But I will not stop until I reach the finish line. Then and only then shall I call it a day. []\\nOur goal for the next three years is clear: a comfortable life for everybody, all Filipinos. We have made significant strides and accomplished signal milestones as a nation in the past three years. This momentum must continue with greater fervor in the next three years and beyond.\\nI dream of glowing days ahead for every Filipino. I dream of a Philippines better than the one I grew up with.\\nThis is my pledge and commitment for just three years, if I can. If I cannot, I’m sorry. But I shall continue to comply with my constitutional duty to serve and protect the Filipino, until the last day of my term.\\nGod Bless the Filipino. God Bless the Philippines. Thank you very much!

OF\\nRODRIGO ROA DUTERTE\\nPRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES\\nTO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES\\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 27 July 2020]\\nKindly…\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; Chief Justice Diosdado Peralta and the justices of the Supreme Court; His Excellency Munther Mafoodh Salim Al-Mantheri and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; mga mahal kong kababayan.\\nWe live in a troubled time. Our dream of prosperity for our country was suddenly snuffed by a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease.\\nBut let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives will itself be laid to rest.\\nIn the meantime, let us express the nation‘s gratitude to those who courageously and willingly put their lives on the line to serve the people and country. We share the griefs of their families and no amount of tears can compensate their great losses.\\nMy countrymen, it is sad that while government focuses its attention and resources to battle the coronavirus, there are those who take advantage of a pre-occupied government.\\nOne of them is Senator Frank Drilon. In an interview, he arrogantly mentioned among others that oligarchs need not be rich. Then he linked the anti-dynasty system with oligarchy and the topic was my daughter and son. This happened after the Committee on Franchise voted 70-11 to deny the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ngrant of franchise to ABS-CBN. Obviously, he was defending the Lopezes that they are not oligarchs.\\nGreat wealth enables economic elites and corporations to influence public policy to their advantage. Media is a powerful tool in the hands of oligarchs like the Lopezes who used their media outlets in their battles with political figures. I am a casualty of the Lopezes during the 2016 election.\\nThe dealers and purveyors of illegal drugs, hiding in the shadow of COVID- 19, have stepped up their activities. The amount of shabu valued at millions of pesos seized during police operations speak volumes of the enormity and weight of the problem that we bear.\\nThe corrupt, the grafters and the influence peddlers also take advantage of the fear and confusion that the coronavirus generates. The financial and material assistance of the government to the unemployed, the sick and the destitute running into billions of pesos, are not spared from corruption and ineptitude. Even the donations from well-meaning private persons are skimmed before reaching their intended beneficiaries. It is like snatching food from the mouths of babes.\\nThe profiteers, over-pricers and corrupt felons must be laughing while they stash their dirty monies. But not for long. They cannot outrun the long arm of the law.\\nIn this regard, the words of former President Ramon Magsaysay ring fresh and relevant today as on the day they were said decades ago. He said:\\n―We need men of integrity and faith like Rizal and del Pilar, men of action like Bonifacio, men of inflexible patriotism like Mabini. We need their zeal, their self-reliance, their capacity for work, their devotion to service, their ability to lose themselves in the common cause of building a nation.‖\\nIf we allow greed, self-interest and ambition to rule us, then as stated by one prominent physician, we will ―be left with nothing better than the lesser evil instead of the greater good.‖\\nIn my inaugural address four years ago, I said that no leader can succeed at anything of national importance [or] significance unless he has the cooperation and support of the people he is tasked to lead and sworn to serve.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe efforts and resources which we poured out produced the momentum needed to bring our country closer to our goals. Suffice it to state, we made significant strides over time.\\nOver 4.3 million poor families benefitted from the Pantawid Pamilya; over 9.2 million beneficiaries received subsidies under the Unconditional Cash Transfer program; we also made available [free] tertiary education and universal health care. Public utility drivers were given assistance through the Pantawid Pasada Program. There are complaints that some drivers did not receive any assistance at all. I have directed the DSWD and DILG to look into this.\\nI welcome the passage of the law postponing the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections. The postponement saved much-needed government funds and ensured implementation of projects under the current barangay officials. In hindsight, it also saved us from holding the polls while we dealt and continue to deal with the pandemic.\\nThe Malasakit Centers Act has proven to be of great help to our less fortunate citizens needing medical services through a one-stop platform in government hospitals. We commend the initiative and work of Senator Bong Go in this regard as well as other significant pieces of legislation. As of today, there are 75 Malasakit Centers serving Filipinos all over the country. These centers will be of great help in ensuring that our people remain healthy and resilient during these challenging times.\\nThe Salary Standardization Law of 2019 increases the salary of civilian government workers. I hope that this law will inspire our government workers to perform better and encourage young, brilliant citizens to join public service.\\nI appreciate the law establishing the National Academy of Sports. We can now give our deserving student-athletes the training and support they need to excel in their chosen field of endeavors.\\nWith the commitment of key members of Congress and the Executive Department, the PHISGOC, Philippine Sports Commission, and the Philippine Olympic Committee were bound together with one vision to host the\\n30th Southeast Asian Games. Our athletes prevailed. More than that, we fostered pride, patriotism, genuine sportsmanship, and camaraderie in our South East Asian brothers and sisters. Indeed, we won as one.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo our business community and the general public, we assure you that the landmark Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act has been gaining momentum. We are closer to eliminating overregulation in government services.\\nFrontline processes, including consular services, processing of building and business permits, and services for overseas Filipinos and seafarers were streamlined. Passports and drivers‘ license validity were lengthened to ease the burden of the public.\\nWe received a BBB plus credit rating despite a sea of credit rating downgrades and negative outlook revisions worldwide. [] The Japan Credit Rating Agency upgraded us from BBB plus to A minus last month.\\nMeanwhile, Moody‘s has affirmed and maintained the country‘s ratings at B2 — Baa2 rather. [Understand. Because of the light I have … My eyesight is not as good as new.] Our fiscal position is strong, our economic and fiscal management prudent and our banking system robust. We are in a better position to weather the crisis caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic.\\nWe have accomplished significant infrastructure projects under the Build Build Build Program. I will not dwell lengthily on the nitty-gritty of our infrastructure accomplishments now lest I bore you. Instead we will release a comprehensive written report on our collective milestones and the details of accomplishments to remind us that perseverance, patience and determination will help us move forward even in the most difficult of times.\\nWe issued last year Executive Order No. 100 establishing the Diversity and Inclusion Program as a national program of the Government. We want to end the discrimination of persons on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity and expression, and other character traits.\\nMy administration always believed that freedom from illegal drugs, terrorism, corruption and criminality, is itself a [human right].\\nPart of our efforts to uphold human rights is protection of the rights of children and the right against discrimination. Early last year, I signed Executive Order No. 92 creating the National Council Against Child Labor. Government efforts to protect the rights of children will be amplified to prevent, reduce and eliminate any form of child labor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur achievements along these lines have been extolled by an overwhelming number of our fellow member-States in the UN Human Rights Council, during its recently held 44th session last June.\\nRest assured that we will not dodge our obligation to fight for human rights.\\nMy countrymen, there are lessons to be learned from the coronavirus pandemic. It jolted us to realize that gains made after spending so much planning, effort, cost and time could diminish considerably and quickly for reasons beyond one‘s anticipation; that it is much easier to destroy than to build; that in a crisis of national proportions that affects every aspect of human life, governments need to have the support and cooperation of the people if it is to succeed in battling the cause of that crisis, that there are people who ask for compassion but show none themselves; that life, after all, is fickle like the weather.\\nThe gains we achieved in the first three and a half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road towards a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered.\\nThe global scale and socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus.\\nIn this regard I would like to express my gratitude to all those who made possible the steady supply of food, water, and basic utilities [to] our households [] and the provision of basic social services and financial assistance to our people. Our profound gratitude goes to everyone who helped keep our country‘s food supply chain running, the valiant soldiers, policemen and security guards who kept peace and order [] in our communities; the dedicated personnel who kept our essential establishments operational. You showed us kindness and selflessness. You gave us strength. You risked your own lives to serve the greater good in keeping with the Filipino spirit of Bayanihan. []\\nI also thank the men and women of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases and the National Task Force against COVID-19 for all the countless hours it spent to keep the pandemic in check and for all the efforts it made to ensure the safety of our people. []\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLet me also recognize the efforts of the local government units that stepped up and initiated their own response measures to contain the effects of COVID-19 and its impact to their constituents. Have been — impact to its constituents. [The shadow says it’s a period there.]\\nI know exactly the difficulties you are undergoing. I pray that the officials of each LGU in our country – from the barangay to the autonomous regions – would set aside partisan politics and selfish interests to do what is right and good for all. []\\nI likewise issued Executive Order No. 104, which imposed ceilings on the retail prices of at least 133 drugs and medicines, and directed a continuous review of the retail prices of others. This proved to be providential now that we are facing a pandemic.\\nTo everyone who helped us in this time of great need, maraming salamat po. []\\nLet me say that the strength of a nation rests in the hands of the people acting as one with government, in the pursuit of common goals and objectives.\\nWhen the pandemic struck, I decided to prioritize life over other considerations. According to experts, the interventions that the government had put in place prevented as much as 1.3 to 3.5 million infections. To me, even if the numbers were much lower, it would still be and would have been worth the sacrifice[s] we made. ―Buhay muna, bago ang lahat.” []\\nWe initially encountered difficulties ramping up our testing capacity. We now have 93 accredited testing laboratories nationwide and we are aiming to conduct 1.4 million tests by end of July and ensure a quick turnaround time of 48 to 72 hours.\\nUnder the Social Amelioration Program, we allotted [PhP205 billion] for poor and low-income households who were affected during this pandemic — who thrive on a ―no-work, no-pay‖ arrangement. Admittedly, our implementation of the Social Amelioration Program was not perfect. And some opportunists turned crisis into opportunity. We will catch up with you sooner than you think.\\nWe came up with the COVID-19 Adjustment Measures Program. We extended financial assistance to over 650,000 affected individuals in the formal sector, 110,000 OFWs abroad, and almost 83,000 repatriated OFWs. We also provided temporary wage employment [opportunities] to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndisplaced marginalized workers through the TUPAD Project. Our indigent senior citizens were also provided with a stipend for the [first] semester of the current year.\\nThis health emergency stretched the government‘s resources to its limits. In response, the Office of the President worked closely with Congress for the quick passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\\nMay I again reiterate my thanks to you, the men and women of Congress, for the effort you invested into passing that law. I hope that we can get some or the same treatment of clarity, purpose and the\\nfastness [] to support the passage of the Bayanihan [to Recover as One Act], which will supplement funds for recovery and response against the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWe must facilitate the country‘s economic recovery. I call on Congress to fast-track the passage of proposed measures such as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or CREATE Act. [] This immediately cuts the corporate income levy from the current 30 to 25 percent and give the government flexibility to grant a combination of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, among others. The Financial Institutions Strategic Transfer or FIST Act will set up mechanisms allowing banks and other financial institutions to dispose of and transfer non-performing assets and loans to asset management companies similar to Special Purpose Vehicles.\\nOur economic managers have seen infrastructure investment as an effective tool to help spur high growth, attract investments, create jobs, and achieve financial inclusion for all Filipinos. The [DPWH] has resumed the construction of the North Luzon Expressway Harbor Link, the NLEX-SLEX Connector, the Cavite-Laguna Expressway, the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, the R-1 Bridge Project, the Tarlac-Pangasinan-La Union Expressway Project, and the Subic Freeport Expressway Project, to name a few. To realize the maximum benefit from the country‘s investments, the infrastructure projects under the Build, Build, Build Program, which are labor and capital intensive, are not mere springboards for the country‘s swift recovery [post]-pandemic. They are economic benefits — economic benefits to be distributed to all corners of the country and push sustainability in urban centers, particularly [Metro] Manila.\\nThe TESDA launched an online mode of livelihood and skills training. There are 71 free online training to help upskill trainees for the right opportunities. [opportunities, I’m sorry]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI ask the TESDA to come up with special training programs to retool our OFWs so they can find employment opportunities here at home. I am also calling on the CHED for scholarship programs for the qualified dependents of our OFWs. I direct the Department of Agriculture and DTI to come up with agri-business and entrepreneurship projects to help displaced OFWs rebuild their livelihood. Further, I ask the LANDBANK and other government financial institutions to continue providing low-interest loans to our\\nOFWs. Sa mga kababayan ko na naghihirap sa ibang bansa, nandito ang inyong gobyerno para matulungan kayo at inyong mga pamilya, lalo na sa panahong ito. []\\nThe government will intensify its efforts to help businesses, especially our micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs, by providing responsive government assistance and services, capitalization, and business operations support as we adapt to the next normal. []\\nNananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors – nananawagan po ako sa ating mga lessors: malasakit at Bayanihan po sana ang pairalin natin ngayon. This is not the time to drive away lessees. During normal times they were the primary source of your income stream. Now, it‘s time to be fair and compassionate. Come up with amenable arrangement with your\\ntenants. Huwag po natin silang ipagtabuyan, tanggalan ng tubig, kuryente, at bubong. Commercial establishments are requested to give grace periods [or] allow deferment of payments, especially for MSMEs that were forced to close down during the quarantine period. Let us help them\\nrecover. []\\nWe pump-primed the recovery and rehabilitation of MSMEs. The DTI, through the Small Business Corporation, set up the PhP1-billion COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program to provide zero-interest loans for MSMEs affected by the pandemic. As of July 10, 2020, over 2,600 loan applications worth [PhP182.5 million] have been approved. We are optimistic that this initiative will help our MSMEs stabilize and recover from their losses.\\nI also enjoin the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and banks operating in the country to provide regulatory relief for our MSMEs and allow loan payment extensions, without incurring penalties and charges. [] We need your help to prevent the collapse of companies saddled with accumulated amortizations and payables caused by the closure of their businesses at the height of the strict quarantine periods.\\nAs we embark on these efforts towards inclusive recovery, we should acknowledge that all forms of government support will go to naught if the\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnew MSMEs do not thrive because of lack of consumer support. Ito ang panahon para suportahan natin ang ating mga kababayan [] na nagnenegosyo at gumagawa ng mga produktong sariling atin.\\nIn the same manner, the tourism and recreation industries, which are among the hardest hit by the pandemic, count on our full support. While we slowly try to put the fun back in our local travels, the national government agencies and LGUs must harmonize their policies to boost tourism [while] ensuring everyone‘s well-being. We enjoin our people to help boost the economy by traveling locally [] [local na lang] once the necessary systems are in place.\\nThe DoST offers its Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program to enable businesses to access training that will help them transition to online and contactless operations.\\nNow more than ever, we need to protect our consumers. I direct the Department of Trade and Industry to ensure the empowerment of Filipinos on their consumer rights, and coordinate strategies between public and private organizations in building a fair, safe, resilient, and sustainable economy. []\\nThere are welcome developments for the e-Commerce industry. But major economic activities take place in a borderless environment with meager regulatory controls. They expose consumers to various risks related to security, data privacy, and misrepresentation.\\nWe must patrol the country‘s cyberspace and enforce online consumer and data protection and privacy laws. We must run after online scammers and those undermining the people‘s trust in online transactions. We must continue to protect Filipinos in the new normal and remind the world that we are responsible stewards of data. I am committed to protect both the physical and digital lives of our law-abiding countrymen. []\\nThe national government shall lead the way in our transition to online systems. I reiterate my call for all government instrumentalities to implement systems that shall make physical queuing a thing of the past.\\nPanahon na para mawala [] na ang pila para mapagsilbihan ang gobyerno nang walang kahirapan para sa tao. The DILG, DBM, and the ARTA, along with all agencies and instrumentalities of government, are hereby directed to make [all] possible services available online. We need to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nadjust to and adopt a paper-less type business and work performance. We need e-governance [to provide] our people with the services they need [from] the comfort of their homes or workplaces. It will enable our bureaucracy to better transition into in the ‘new normal’ and cut or minimize red tape.\\nUntil the COVID-19 vaccine is available, I will not allow the traditional face- to-face teaching or learning unless [all] risks of exposure to sickness are eliminated. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our students and teachers. []\\nIyong…. About two weeks ago, I — I seemed to have said that I would allow the face-to-face classes to resume. But we were talking actually of January because my thinking is that by September, we would have the vaccine. How to get it from the producers or from other governments is really something which we have to deal with because everyone — the… It’s a global need and everyone will go for it.\\nBut let me just mention it in passing that about four days ago, I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first or if it is needed, if we have to buy it, that we will be granted credit so that we can normalize as fast as possible.\\nLife that is lost is lost forever. Courses that are not substantial can be supplemented. Education that is delayed can be recovered.\\nWe must implement online learning, modular learning, and TV- and radio- based broadcast, which students coming from different backgrounds can avail. DepEd will provide printed modules for those who cannot afford online learning.\\nIn support of the Learning Continuity Program through blended learning, we plan to increase the number of schools with ICT equipment in the coming months.\\nThe DepEd and the DICT are building up the Public Education Network or PEN that will connect all public schools and DepEd offices nationwide. We will prioritize the connection of all Last Mile Schools and those with no electricity supply can have it via satellite and energized via solar panels. By 2022,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nbefore I step down, the PEN shall be realized. [] I‘m referring to the program. I will — I will do it.\\nTV frequencies reverted back to the government for whatever cause or reason [shall be used] exclusively to the exclusion of [private] persons or [their] dummies, to cope with the demand of the next normal. These will be used to provide uninterrupted quality education to our children in our shift to e-learning.\\nI am directing Secretary Guevarra, Secretary Dela Peña and Secretary Honasan, in collaboration with Secretary Briones, and Secretary Avisado, together with Secretary Dominguez, to come up with an integrated program and implementation mechanism to ensure that these TV frequencies are fully utilized by government through the facilities of PTV4 for the utmost benefit of the Filipino people. []\\nLet me just — allow me to segue a little bit. For the remaining two years of my term, all that is good that belongs to government, whether it be the airwaves, whether it be the lines, or whatever that is good for the people, will belong to the government and it should be government who should be given the first option to utilize them. Ang sobra, kanila. []\\nI call on our [telecommunication] companies to improve their services lest we be forced to take drastic steps to address the less-than-ideal service that the public is getting from you.\\nAlam mo sisingit na lang ako dito. I am… Sometimes we are a government pictured to be weak and incompetent because we cannot really force our mandate. Alam mo itong nagbibigay ng mga public services, you better improve.\\nHuwag naman ninyo kaming pahintayin sampung taon bago kami makakamit ng mga services that the other countries are enjoying. If it’s just a question of added capitalization or the infusion of money, go and look for it. Maghanap kayo because if you are not ready to improve — anak — I might just as well close all of you and we revert back to the line telephone at kukunin ko ‘yan, i-expropriate ko sa gobyerno.\\nAlam mo itong… I’ll be straight, iyong Smart pati itong Globe, ilang taon na ito, at ang sagot palagi sa akin, “the party cannot be reached.” Eh nasaan pala pumunta ‘yung y*** na ‘yon?\\nEh kung ganoon lang naman ibigay ninyo sa amin, we are a republic, a sovereign country, bear that in mind because the patience of the Filipino\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npeople is reaching its limit, at I will be the one to articulate the anger of the Filipino people. And you might not want what I intend to do with you.\\nKindly improve the services before December. I want to call Jesus Christ to Bethlehem. Better have that line cleared. [] Alam mo sa totoo lang, at the end — naa-ano na ako sa inyo. I have been a citizen of this country and parang nilalaro lang ninyo ang…\\nKayong may pera, p***. May pera kayo? Negosyo kayo. Wala kayong pera? P***, umalis kayo dito. You know, you give us half deals, half-cooked transactions, lousy service. Tapos ang tao nagbabayad.\\nTell us now if you cannot really improve on it because I will work by December. I have two years. The next two years will be spent improving the telecommunications of this country without you. I will find a way. I will talk to Congress and find a way how to do it. []\\nLast year, I said that distributing economic and business activities is imperative to our country‘s sustained and equitable growth. Today I reiterate that statement.\\nI issued Administrative Order No. 18, directing concerned agencies to strengthen the development of Special Economic Zones in areas outside Metro Manila.\\nI also issued Executive Order No. 114 to institutionalize the Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa Program. This consolidates and refocuses existing economic and social welfare programs, activities and projects toward the countryside. It also [establishes] an [inter-agency] council, headed by Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea, which will create a framework for the effective implementation of the project. [Kung hindi ninyo ako naiintindihan sa binabasa ko, mas lalo ako.] []\\nIn 2021, we aim to increase access to healthcare services by continuously hiring and deploying more than 20,000 health professionals. This will augment health workforce in the LGUs, particularly in isolated and disadvantaged areas. We will implement projects to establish and improve Barangay Health Stations, Rural Health Units, and other healthcare facilities.\\n[But] we [still] need to address internal security. We are pursuing a whole- of-nation approach to bring peace and order and development in the countryside. We need to provide interventions and implement the Barangay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDevelopment Program. This would provide cleared and threatened communities and… This refers to a program where the Armed Forces would play a vital role in the one-nation approach. This is what simply — mean by this. And that everyone, every agency of the government including the Armed Forces of the Philippines should participate. And I am aware of the skirmishes and the assassination of our soldiers and I said, ―Correct this so that we can proceed with the barangay implementation as fast as possible.‖\\nWe have made significant strides in the past four years, but we need the support of local government leaders. We need your help to implement the Barangay Development Program.\\nCertain sectors expressed concerns when I declared martial law in Mindanao and its extension three times. But 2019 ended without my office requesting any further extension.\\nMartial law in Mindanao ended without abuses by the civilian sector, by the police, by the military. [] It ended because this time I know that they know how to love the country.\\nI thank Congress for its support to this administration‘s programs. Congress has been very productive. But much more remains to be done.\\nYou know actually my speech if you followed it carefully, it‘s all a plea to Congress to do this, to do that, to make a law or craft a whatever.\\nAnd this one, I strongly urge Congress to pass a law establishing the Department of Overseas Filipinos [focused] solely on addressing the concerns of Filipinos abroad and their families.\\nI reiterate the swift passage — before that — before this… Kawawa kasi itong ating mga overseas. If it‘s only an office there in the Labor department they are overworked or for whatever reason, their needs, their pleas are not really attended to with dispatch and with care. OFW pati itong ano ngayon ito ̳yung sinabi ko kanina, they — I… I will go for it. We will need it to help them.\\nI reiterate the swift passage of a law reviving the death\\npenalty [] by lethal injection for crimes specified under the Comprehensive Dangerous [Drugs] Act of 2002. I did not hear so much clapping so I presume that [] they are not interested. Wala kang… Someday I‘ll tell you the story what happened to the Philippines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHindi ngayon. But when I‘m — sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo bakit nagkaganito ‘yung droga ng Pilipinas. Why the drug syndicates continue to operate just like the countries of Colombia, Mexico, and it is being played inside the national penitentiaries. Para tayong — talagang binababoy tayo. Sabihin ko sa inyo. But this is not a time for storytelling. SONA kasi ito so dito na lang.\\nThis law will not only help us deter criminality but also save our children from the dangers posed by illegal and dangerous drugs.\\nMay I be allowed with the indulgence of the body, itong bakit talaga ako galit sa droga. Let us make this a semi-formal speech. Alam mo kasi limang pamilya members o anim or pito, pagka bumagsak ̳yung tatay to drugs, the family crumbles. There‘s no more home to them. Droga, and if he‘s receiving a salary naglala — nagtatrabaho sa pantalan, 300 a day, tapos ang shabu is sold at two. He has about 100 to bring home. Kaya pagka ganun nagaaway- away na, ang mga bata hindi nakakapag-aral, ̳yung iba ligaw na mga babae into early prostitution kung ano-ano nangyari. Hindi lang alam nitong mga — – na this is happening all over the country everyday. And what is really very tragic is this, when the family starts to crumble, there‘s no home, and invariably the wife would look for another… Now the husband will look for a job usually easily doon sa abroad. At ̳yung asawa aalis, ̳yung bana — lalaki nasa droga, ̳yung mga anak iniiwan sa kapitbahay, sa kapatid. And the ferocity of the laws of the Filipino family home has been destroyed. Kaya kung anong mangyari nito the wife works in the Middle East. I am not zeroing on any particular country mind you. But alam naman natin there are tribes in the Middle East which would allow rape as part of the territory of being a househelp. Kasama ̳yan, kasama talaga ̳yan. So iyan ang mahirap diyan. You have a wife there being crucified, being used. Magpadala ng pera tapos ang mga anak nasa shabu na rin kasi these are the guys that the shabu people would really you know they stick by them until it crumbles, the resistance. And then you have plenty of this all over the country. Hindi lang nila alam ̳yung sinasabi nila na misery sa itong human rights, plus 10 ̳yan. Not to count the victims of crimes perpetrated by people addicted to shabu. That is the reason why I‘m so vicious in my — galit talaga ako kasi nilalaruan tayo. Well, I don‘t know any other president might — pero ako ayaw ko ̳yon. Ayaw kong lalaruan ang Pilipino. Do not do it in my country because I will really kill you. That is a commitment.\\nOwning safe, decent and affordable housing is every Filipino‘s dream. But the housing market remains inaccessible to most of our countrymen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI renew my call for Congress to pass the National Housing Development bill and the Rental Housing Subsidy bill. These will enable all Filipinos— regardless of social status—to live in decent homes where their families can lead meaningful lives.\\nI also call on Congress to amend Republic Act No. 10912 [or] the Continuing Professional Development Act of 2016. In this time of great pandemic and forthcoming reconstruction, requiring our professionals to undergo seminars is burdensome and not realistic. This must end.\\nIto pang isa, there are — may mga profession… Isingit ko na lang lahat tutal this is to inform the nation. May mga profession na they would require — I think it‘s the nurses — they would require them to come to Manila to retrain and — for another round of expenses. Itong mga seminar-seminar na ito dapat mahinto. I don‘t know in other provinces [] but during my time ̳yang — [ano ‘tong sa barangay na?] barangay expeditions ng mga opisyal, hininto ko rin ̳yan. Which reminds me, I will act on this also in due time.\\nWe hail our health professionals as heroes. Now is the time to pass the Advanced Nursing — iyan ho — Nursing Education Act and the law instituting the Medical Reserve Corps.\\nCOVID-19 will not only be the last pandemic. We need to create a National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better respond to future outbreaks. We count on Congress‘ full support. You can just let it remain for a while in the Department of Health kung wala pang pera but you have to expand the services or it will also entail a little bit of money but not really as much as expensive when you set up a department.\\nIn the long term, we are looking into the creation of the National Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better prepare for pandemics, protect lives, and allow development to proceed even in the worst of times. We are counting on the full support of Congress for this critically important endeavor.\\nI don‘t know but I‘ll leave it to Congress to really… It‘s another department. There seems that it could be a multilayer redundant thing between the health and the proposed department.\\nI call on Congress to prioritize the passage of a law for the Unified System of Separation, Retirement and Pension of the Military and Uniformed Personnel without however diminishing the benefits that our uniformed personnel are\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nentitled to under existing laws. [] There is a need to adjust the pension system which will be applicable only to newly-hired uniformed personnel so as not to cause a ―ballooning effect‖ against the budget of the military in the years to come and yet maintain the pension benefits of those already in service under the present law. This issue needs a solution\\nnow. Umpisahan natin ngayon para hindi na maging problema sa susunod na mga taon.\\nI want to… You know one of the… This is not politicking, I am not running. I cannot run anymore. Iyong dinoble ko ̳yung suweldo ng pulis pati army it was really a clarion call para for them also to have a decent life and they are able to get the things which ordinarily cannot be reached by any government employee. Ang akin doon is ̳yung corruption that maybe it might be a vain attempt but maybe dagdagan ang suweldo para it would be a hedge against corruption.\\nWe must also modernize the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Bureau of Immigration with urgency.\\nAlam mo sa Davao and if you go there I can show you, one of the serviceable trucks, fire trucks that we have in the City of Davao… Of course ang city mayroon ng sarili aside from the Bureau of Fire — Bureau of Fire which is really national, mayroon ‘yung Bureau of Fire. Would you believe it? Serviceable still. Ang pangalan ng truck, Studebaker. Ang katawan — ang talagang matatag ang katawan. Kaya ang makina, Isuzu. [] Pero okay pa rin. It can put out fire. Totoo. This is how this Bureau of Fire issue na medyo na — na-overlook natin nang matagal.\\nI emphasize the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. Our people‘s safety cannot be delegated to a council or commission. Equally important is the establishment of evacuation centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country. We must act [now] before another major disaster shakes [us] into action.\\nThe problem is disaster and even a fire cannot be — make — they cannot make a study for projection when the earthquake would suddenly come and make a big crack there. Hindi natin alam talaga.\\nAng ibig kong sabihin, this will require more than just one brainwork kung paano talaga itong how to prevent or avoid disaster. It will be… By the way, just before starting, I was tempted to say it pero baka magtindigan kayo. It will be all right for me if Bong Go will just stay. Wala akong problema. Kasi sabi ko na this piece of speech of mine would be one of the longest SONAs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthat I will deliver. Nakita ko ‘yung page pagbigay sa akin. Iyong ibang input, akin. But ‘yung iba lahat. Ang nangyari po, binalik ko sa kanila. ―Make it short.‖ Pagbalik sa akin, mas makapal na. “Naku, p***** i**.” Eh di nandiyan na ngayon. Ito na ngayon.\\nThe responsible extraction and equitable distribution of natural resources remain among my non-negotiables. I reiterate the need for the passage of the National Land Use Act which has been pending for decades. Pakisilip lang ho ninyo ‘yan.\\nFor the rest of my term, I hope to see concerted efforts in protecting the environment.\\nThe rehabilitation of Boracay Island showcased our resolve to safeguard the environment. [] Boracay is doing well because of its scenery. If it‘s only a coconut and a black — white sand and water, wala ̳yan. Pero you add the — the visitors there, then it becomes a very tempting destination.\\nWe have seen the remarkable reemergence of the Island back to its former glory. I want this sustained. I ask Congress to enact a law creating — importante ito — the Boracay Island [Development] Authority or BIDA. We need it.\\nI cannot stress enough the importance of agriculture. The growth of our economy depends on a robust agricultural sector.\\nWe must utilize the coconut — ito, isa — we must utilize the [coco levy funds] for the welfare our coconut farmers and the development of our coconut industry. I urge everybody — both of the Executive Department pati ito — that ito ‘yung pera na nakuha doon sa na-sequester. And itong perang malaking ito, gagamitin ito for the welfare of the farmers.\\nThe problem is, we can no longer trace who are the farmers of yesterday. Marcos was — Marcos is a distant star. We do not know. Ako, alam ko because we had a little piece also that was covered by the land reform. Hindi na natin malaman kung sino ang may-ari.\\nSo I think Congress should look again and try to sort out how best the money can be utilized. I will not make any suggestion but I leave it to Congress to decide what to do with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers‘ Trust Fund. Tulungan natin ang ating mga magsasaka pagka hindi mawawala ‘yang pera, bilyon ‘yan. [] Jusko po. Well anyway the… We have learned so many lessons along the way.\\nI am also requesting Congress to pass the Rural Agricultural and Fisheries Development Financing System Act.\\nWe aim to provide adequate, accessible and affordable food for every Filipino [family] through the Plant, Plant, Plant Program. [] After the Build, Build, Build… I think this is easier to achieve. A few good men — a few good regional directors, DAR and the dedicated workers down below could make this thing a success. Mas madali ito kaysa Build, Build, Build. Ito Plant, Plant, Plant lang eh. It is more of a the — well, how you try to convince the farmers to cooperate with government for their benefit.\\nThis PhP66-billion agricultural stimulus package will help the agriculture and fisheries sector recover. I hope so. []\\nWe need to build trust and confidence in online transactions, stronger protection for online consumers and enabling measures for online businesses is needed through the enactment of an Internet Transactions Act\\n(ITA). [] This is very good.\\nI thus direct the Department of Trade and Industry and other relevant [government] agencies to work closely with Congress in ensuring that the provisions of the proposed bill are responsive to the needs of the consumers while promoting the growth of e-Commerce in the country. [] If you are tired of clapping, you just say so. I can make a\\nshortcut. [] Pabilisan lang ‘yan.\\nOn the path to better governance, we travel with others. Partners – both old and new – have helped. For bolstering our antiquated public health system, for bringing home our laid off Filipinos overseas, for filling in supply gaps for crucial medical supplies and equipment and staple food, for these and many more, the Philippines thanks all friendly nations. We will never forget your kindness and your timely support.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin ASEAN and beyond, the Philippines will continue to work with partners to address global perils and ramp up cooperation to secure for our peoples, greater peace, progress and prosperity.\\nThe Filipino nation claims its rightful place in the community of sovereign states. Thus, we will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy. Let me be very clear about this.\\nMay I cut my prepared speech? Alam mo, I read a little over three weeks or last month na the Americans would — intends to go back to Subic.\\nI will just put on record my thoughts. I have nothing against America, I have nothing against China but if you put bases here, you will double the spectacle of a most destructive thing just like Manila during the Second World War — during the retaking of this city. One of the most devastated cities in the world.\\nKaya maglagay-lagay ka ng base at this time, this will ensure if war breaks out, because there would be atomic arsenals brought in, this will ensure the extinction of the Filipino race.\\nWe worked without fail to protect our rights in the South China Sea, neither beholden nor a pawn to anyone. We broadened the boundaries of Philippine diplomacy. We built productive ties with everyone willing to engage us on the basis of equality and mutual respect. And, we redefined our relationships with our most important partners, placing the country in a far better position to advance our interests in an evolving regional order and emerging global problems. []\\nNow, plenty of critics, both sides, claim about nothing has been done to retake forcefully or physically the South China Sea.\\nAlam mo, unless we are prepared to go to war, I would suggest that we better just call off and treat this, I said, with diplomatic endeavors.\\nChina is claiming it. We are claiming it. China has the arms, we do not have it.\\nSo, it is simple as that. They are in possession of the property. It will remain a property of a — if you’re a lawyer, property rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThey are — it has nothing to do with the Philippine Laws of Property but it‘s akin to — they are in possession. So what can we do? We have to go to war and I cannot afford it. Maybe some other president can, but I cannot. Inutil ako diyan, sabihin ko sa inyo. And I’m willing to admit it. Talagang inutil ako diyan. Wala akong magawa. I cannot…\\nThe moment I send my Marines there at the coastal shores of Palawan, tinamaan ng cruise missile lahat iyan. Hindi pa nga naka-set sail iyan eh, sabog na.\\nLet me say again that victory in the global battle against COVID-19 would take longer than we expect. Everyone‘s cooperation is needed. I know that you, the Filipino people, have sacrificed a lot. But we have no other choice but to work together and to do even more.\\nI must admit that our actions have been far from perfect — totoo iyan I admit it — and there could be improvements here or there—but all of us in government, including myself, assure you that we will not stop until we get things right and better for you. []\\nI know that many of you are worried not only about health and safety but also about our ability to move around and ride public transportation; the depletion of your savings due to the rising cost of goods; and the loss of your incomes due to uncertainties in your jobs and livelihood. I assure you that your government will [squarely address] these problems and challenges to overcome them and proceed to the ̳new normal‘.\\nMarami ho talagang mawawalaan ng — those for the middle-income. They buy a car on installment basis. If you cannot keep up with the amortization, you’ll lose it — you‘ll lose the car and you are forced to ride on public utilities.\\nConcomitantly, didiretso rin itong mga criminal na rarami at crimes will increase. But let me assure you, for as long as I am President, there can never be a runaway crime in any of our cities. Hindi ako papayag ng ganun. I can assure you we will remain peaceful — relatively\\npeaceful. [] Hindi naman very peaceful. Pero kung sabihin mo na kagaya ng holdup dito, holdup, ah… Alam naman nila kung ano mangyayari. You know what will happen to you.\\nI am addressing myself to the criminals. You commit holdups, you commit rapes, you commit all sorts of things and you harm the public, then kaaway mo na ako. Kapag bumalik kayo sa dati kagaya noon, patong-patong na\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nnaman ang patay dito. Sigurado hahanapin ko kayo. Do not ever go back to your old ways. Maghanap na lang kayo ng anong trabaho diyan. Magtiis kayo.\\nTo open up the economy to pre-Covid-19 levels at this time is not an option because whatever good it can produce will only be gobbled up, or be outweighed, by the bad it will generate. Sometimes, haste does make waste. The recent upsurge of infections when we opened little windows to the resumption of business is proof of that.\\nI am happy that I have talked to you today. You know, in other places they opened up too early too soon. America is one. China — well fortunately, it was arrested on time. China and the rest for those who opened up and those who do not follow the protocols of the — at least the World Health Organization — they are suffering and they have at least 140 deaths.\\nAng Amerika nagkukulang sila lahat. No nation on earth was really prepared for COVID. No amount of preparation because that kind of microbes visits about once every 100 years. Wala man ̳yung — mga tatay natin, what they suffered was Second World War, but tayo…\\nWe are not ready and therefore we will not gamble with the lives and health of the people. Certainly, no one would want to end up on the negative side of the equation. Not me, not us.\\nAll I ask is that you continue to put your faith in your government and work with us in achieving what is best for our country and our people. Together, let us do — mahirap basahin kasi dito eh — the most that we can to ensure that the health, safety and well-being of every Filipino—especially those severely affected —are taken care of.\\nTogether, we shall fight this pandemic with the same fervor as our campaign against illegal drugs, criminality, insurgency, and corruption in high places and entrenched parochial interests.\\nAs a government worker, I am addressing each and every Filipino that the government cannot do this without your help. More than ever, we need to\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nreinvigorate the deep-seated Filipino spirit of pakisama and malasakit within each and everyone of us.\\nWe are being — we are being tested, as a people and as a nation. Worse times loom ahead. But I do hope that this spirit of solidarity and unity will serve as the drumbeat to which we shall march in unison in our quest for the light at the end of the tunnel.\\nI appeal to each and every Filipino, let us take care of one another. Ito ang panahon para magtulungan. Hindi ito ang panahon para maglamanan — maglaman — lamang-lamangan — lamang. Mamang p*** — dila\\nko. [] Hindi maglamang — at pagkakaisa.\\nMy faith in the Filipino innate patience, resilience and determination to bounce back is unwavering. Let us share our blessings with those who have little and those who have none. This is the time to bring out the best in us.\\nThe woes that weigh heavily upon our shoulders may bend our back, but they shall not bend or break our spirit.\\nFrom the rubbles of adversity, a more resilient and stronger nation built on Bayanihan and Pagkakaisa shall rise.\\nTogether, we shall overcome.\\nBefore I… Pardon the time but it was really the allotted time for my speech. I would just like to give a statement between — between us sa gobyerno kung hindi tayo nagkakaintindihan.\\nYou know Drilon, stand it — he was defending… I would like to ask Drilon, were you a part of ACCRA when this contract of Ayala water was being drafted?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd why are you fumigating? Bakit kasi ikaw lang ang galit? Na sabi mo na dynasty-dynasty. You are a hypocrite. You know that you cannot pass an anti-dynasty law. Ikaw ang nandiyan sa Congress, ̳di ikaw ang mauna dito.\\nBut you know, to take it against me for protecting my country is something which I really resent. Alam mo you described using the dictionary the synonym ng mga oligarchs, oligarchy, kung ano, then you proceeded to characterize everyone every — every name and then said that oligarchy is not bad at all because sa — not all oligarchies are bad. True.\\nBut ito, to my countrymen, the oligarchy that exists in this country is the oligarchy that existed during the Spanish time. And the Spanish lands and the friar lands and all the benefits that were passed on to the Insulares who did not go back to Spain or to the Spaniards and into their… But that was long ago, it has been forgotten. This is the oligarchy that controls the Philippines by what? By taking control of the water and the electricity and power. Iyan ang oligarchy mo Drilon. []\\nWala ng oligarchy dito except that. They have controlled. Look at… How can you now craft a new contract? Because I would insist that you pay the billions and billions that you collected.\\nFor example, water treatment. O nandiyan sa kontrata. It‘s in the billing, they are being collected since 1997. Ilang bilyon na nga wala ni isa, not even a faucet was built for a water treatment facility.\\nIyan ang mahirap sa… You do not protect the oligarchs here. You are the one. Ikaw lang mag-isa. And I suspect that you were also the one — or helped when you were there in the ACCRA.\\nWe do not even know the — ang mga abogado sa public documents hindi nga alam. Hindi nga natin alam kung naka-graduate ba o hindi. Wala. Would you think Ayala would get the services of those…? Ayala got ACCRA. ACCRA did it. Ikaw galing ka doon, most of you, more successful lawyers sa corporation, you handle big corporate. Iyan ang mahirap.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBangga tayo dito. Me, hinawakan ninyo eh.

O ayan, wala ka, palaging brownout, lahat.\\nI‘m sorry but I have to say this to you. I do not like it. It‘s not the time for it, but since it is the time for the SONA, for people to know and people to really get the facts, then — and the right of the people to be heard.\\nTayo na naman ang tao magsabi.

       "82  \\n\\n\\tState of the Nation Address of \\n\\tRodrigo Roa Duterte \\n\\tPresident of the Philippines \\n\\tto the Congress of the Philippines\\n\\n\\n\\tSession Hall of the House of \\n\\tRepresentatives\\n\\n\\n\\t[Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 26, 2021]\\n\\nKindly sit down.\\nBy far this is the most beautiful SONA crowd that ever happened here. [ and cheers] So many — so many beautiful faces and you only have to guess when you see the full face of the person.\\nSenate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Lord Allan Jay Velasco and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Joseph Ejercito Estrada; the Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the justices of the Supreme Court; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Dean of the Diplomatic Corps His Excellency Archbishop Charles John Brown and the distinguished members of the Diplomatic Corps; my fellow government workers; and of course to my lovely wife Honeylet; mga mahal kong kababayan [].\\nWhen I assumed the presidency five years ago, dominant in my mind were dreams and visions of a better life for all Filipinos. I saw them as reachable through the institution of reforms and radical changes in both the structure of government and the mode of governance — changes designed [to yield] responsibility [and] accountability. All in consonance with the truth that public office is a public trust.\\nWhen I ran for the presidency, I just made fundamental promises and strangely you can count them by the fingers of your hand. I made those changes, which I thought that was really at that time doable.\\nTo offer free education — it’s there already — the Universal Health Care [], nandiyan na po; the fight against illegal drugs, [] criminality and corruption; and the development of infrastructure, including free irrigation and other big ticket projects, which I thought I did not have the funds to do it, but per chance, among others, they were done in my term.\\nToday as I approach the end of my term, I have less visions but more remembrances. But mine is not to rue or to second guess what might have been, but to bear and respond with urgency [to the impact] of unforeseen events as they unfold.\\nEven before I took my oath of office, [I] – and everyone else, I suppose – knew the gravity [and] enormity of the problems that the country was facing. And precisely because of that awareness, I was driven to hasten the implementation of changes which I believed the country needed, keeping in mind that the Constitution afforded me only six years to make those changes happen. Making a difference within the constitutional time-frame is what I was up against. But no one gets by legally without worming through the needle’s eye of constitutional imperatives.\\nThat is why I cajoled, I shoved, I pushed, and I tangled with men of wealth and influence who were oblivious to the anguish and pleas of the weak and impoverished. And for that, I was pilloried to no end. But I did not succumb to the attacks. And neither did I allow criticisms, however intense, to dampen my determination and initiatives, because my purpose was pure and unpolluted. []\\nWhile we were busy instituting reforms, the twin ogres of illegal drugs and corruption laid low for a while only to resurface us — still with us, and make no mistake about it corruption is but another term for stealing people’s money, dashing, in its wake, a nation’s goals and aspirations.\\nDue to the brilliant programs and excellent work of our economic managers and the extraordinary cooperation between the executive and the legislative branches of government, our economy, with investor confidence, was poised to leapfrog into the company of the world’s fastest growing economies until the COVID-19 pandemic stalled everything.\\nBe that as it may, allow me this opportunity to extend my personal and the nation’s gratitude to all those who selflessly gave their all in the fight against COVID-19. Our health workers and other frontliners who risked their own safety [] to keep our essential health services and our food supply chain running, [boost] economic activity, and ensure peace and order in our communities.\\nI would like also to extend my deepest appreciation for the generosity of the private sector who came to the government’s aid in fighting COVID-19. [] I am profoundly thankful for your sustained assistance to our fellow Filipinos, [] amidst the same deleterious effect of the pandemic to your respective industries. Let me assure you that the government is committed to assist the private sector to regain the commercial vibrance of the country prior to the pandemic. []\\nTo our local [chief] executives, this pandemic pushed you to step up and deliver responsive assistance. I am glad to have seen you undertake new and heightened responsibilities, working doubly hard to protect your constituents. []\\nTo the international development partners who extended a helping hand amidst the global health emergency, the Philippines remembers your kindness and goodwill with sincere gratitude. []\\nAnd to all of you who answered the call to protect one another by adhering to our nation’s [health] protocols, daghang salamat. []\\nBut then, let me ask, perhaps you and to myself: What exactly is the state of the nation today in the light of the pandemic which has paralyzed business activities and crippled even the strongest of the world’s economies? So where do we go from here?\\n[Looking Back to our Accomplishments]\\nIn my first SONA, I laid down with utmost commitment and resolve the overall direction of my presidency: a comfortable life for all Filipinos anchored on a people-centered approach to development and governance. If I remember correctly, my administration, I said, will implement a human approach to development and governance, in our people’s welfare in the areas of health, free education, adequate food and housing, environmental preservation, and respect for the culture.\\nI bore no illusion that steering the nation towards a comfortable life for every Filipino would be easy. Indeed, the past five years have truly been challenging and humbling. I stand here before you today bearing no conceit, but if there is one thing that I could be proud of is that not once did I waver in doing the unpopular even if it meant upholding the greatest good for the greatest number. []\\nBefore I took office, our country was beset with a communist insurgency scattered across the nation, a separatist movement that sought to divide us on the basis of religion and religious differences, and the proliferation of illegal drugs and criminality.\\nOur armed forces were ill-equipped to deal with internal and external threats, while the police force had been overwhelmed by criminality and the drug trade problem. This is why I made it a priority to strengthen the institution and boost the morale of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, and the Philippine National Police, and other armed services. []\\nAgain, I thank Congress for working with the executive department in enhancing the capabilities of the AFP and the PNP through our modernization program.\\nIn 2018, we raised the salaries of our military and uniformed policemen and personnel [] to a level commensurate to the critical role they play in upholding national security and maintaining order.\\nI am asking Congress to pass a Unified System for Separation, Retirement and Pension of Military and Uniformed Personnel to maintain [] government fiscal flexibility and provide adequate benefits and remuneration to our men and women in uniform. This shall apply only to the new entrants of the Military and [Uniformed] Services.\\nHindi ho lahat. It cannot be that we have to pay so many, even the salaries of the retired. They get a chunk of the big budget. And if we include the new entrants, the funds available for them would not be enough.\\nIt is also high time for us to pass a law providing Free Legal Assistance to AFP and PNP Officers and Enlisted Personnel [] to help [defend] them from charges arising from incidents related to the performance of official duty. []\\nThe continuous upgrading of our defense capability shall ensure that we shall uphold our territorial integrity and sovereignty from external and [internal] security threats, among the new additions. [] We welcomed the country’s two missile-capable warships, to enable us to protect our seas.\\nBy providing them with the necessary equipment, by enhancing their professional capabilities, and looking after the families of the soldiers who would not be longer be in their company. We do not only strengthen our military and police institutions — we also inspire them to serve this nation with the highest degree of loyalty and patriotism. We enabled them to carry out their mandate to defeat all enemies of the state whatever the cost.\\nIndeed, I am proud of the accomplishments of our troops in securing our nation against all threats to our democratic institutions. [] But peace must be realized — peace and security is not only just a military concern. That is why we deviated from the traditional purely military approach in dealing with matters of national security.\\nWith the creation of the National Task Force to End [Local] Communist Armed Conflict or NTF-ELCAC, [] we have made great strides in addressing the root causes of this conflict by empowering our kababayans who have been used by the communists for so many decades.\\nIn our continuing effort to build safe and conflict-resilient barangays, we have worked towards the sustainable rehabilitation and development of communities where the communists used to operate.\\nThrough the NTF-ELCAC, we invested in farm-to-market roads, school buildings, water and sanitation [systems], [] health stations, and livelihood [projects].\\nAlam mo, kasali na tayo dito lahat. Always every law or every regulation must pass Congress, of course, to the President. But sometimes, you know, in our… Well, in the performance of our duties, we encounter the not-so-nice of confronting each other.\\nBut because of these interventions, more than [17,000] former communist rebels have surrendered to the government. They have returned to the fold of the law and are happily reintegrating to [society], [the Enhanced Community Local Integration Program] or E-CLIP. []\\nIt’s either I am talking too fast or too slow or the operator of this thing here is drowsy. [] Maybe because I had so many ad libs along the way. Marami ho akong akin lang. Kaya ‘yung… [] Nahinto ako. When I stop and I process something in my — the gray matter between my ears — hindi humahabol o hindi alam ng operator.\\nHindi bale, ma’am. Mahal pa rin kita. [] Lalaki ba ito o ‘yung mga babae? Kagabi ‘yung mga babae. Sila? O sabihin mo sa kanila makipagkita ako mamaya. I will embrace them for their punctuality in operating this ano — this strange machine that [] gives you the speech.\\nWith the support of our local government units, I am confident that support for the communist movement will continue to erode in the next few months. [] And like the decades-old Moro rebellion in Mindanao, we will also bring an end to the armed struggle of the communists once and for all. []\\nSa totoo lang, itong komunista college pa ako. Hanggang ngayon, ang mga — sige pa rin. So… Speech-speech man lang ito. Kunwari lang pero ang totoo there’s a lot of fighting going on in the countryside. But I’d like to credit the police and the military for destroying so many communist fronts. [] I think they have destroyed more than 15 apparatus of the fronts of the Communist Party of the Philippines.\\nAlam mo, mag-istorya muna tayo sa taxation. I’d like to be frank with you. Everybody, as everybody in this country, are paying taxes to the communists. The Communist Party earns billions but pass on a little to their fighting men who die for an ideology that is so rotten and corrupt.\\nThey themselves are pocketing the money and their children are studying in Europe and in other places, which I think none of you here can finance such journey. Iyan ang masakit dito. They collect taxes, support Sison in Netherlands, and they do nothing but bad-mouth the government and mouth the war dogmas and everything.\\nHindi na sila napagod. It’s about 53 years in the making. And until today, the poor people are dying. The cadres and most of them belonging to the indigenous tribes of our country are fighting a losing battle between the communist and the government. They waste lives, they enlist children and they are proud of it, but they deny it.\\nBut when you go to the mountains such as I and Senator Go many times, even during the elections, they were there with so many arms that I think somebody — an idiot here in the Philippines supplied the firearms.\\nI’d like to ask Congress, especially Senator Bato, kindly dig on because we have identified the person who imported the AK-47 into this country on the pretext of using it in the security — providing security and guards in all, in business establishments and for those who can afford their home.\\nThis policeman, I think, is still there. He was a colonel and he is still… Walang nangyari. At maraming sundalong namatay dahil sa mga armas na pinasok nila dito sa Pilipinas.\\nSo that my orders to the — to you, if you see them walking around, kindly shoot them dead. I would be happy. Anyway, you are already charged in the ICC together with me. So what is the problem of adding another one? Another idiot Filipino who has caused great damage to our country. Iyan ho ang totoo diyan. At itong mga pulis…\\nBut let me go back in time. When I first said I will fight drugs in six months, I thought it was like in Davao. You can either coerce, intimidate or bribe them, or give them money, I said, “Lumabas kayo ng Davao. Doon kayo magkalat sa Luzon at sa ibang lugar, huwag dito sa Davao.” Naniniwala naman ang mga ulol at we were able to attain a sense of normalcy in the city. Iyon ho ang totoo.\\nThere are people charged with corruption and even going to prison for just maybe not telling the truth in their itong assets and liabilities, nakukulong. Eh p***… Itong mga pulis who are doing their thing, their drugs, they were the manufacturers and they were the distributor of drugs. When I became President, I asked Dela Rosa — he was the chief of police of my city — I promoted him direct to be PNP chief. Four star na kaagad automatic. But I told them, I told him and the others, “Look for the enemies. Look where — for where they are and if you find them, destroy the apparatus, destroy all from the manufacturers to the peddlers because we are fighting a drug war that was being participated in the business by nine generals of the PNP.”\\nKaya ‘yan ang masakit sa loob ko. I did not know that I was fighting my own government. Customs and everyone else were facilitating the importation of drugs. And one importation, as you can see it every night on TV, the police now seize about almost a billion worth of drugs everyday.\\nAnd if you look at the [8888], there are about a thousand Filipinos arrested everyday by the police in connection with drug trafficking. And that is why I go crazy looking at the situation. They are still around. We do not have the laboratories now because nawala na sila at itong naiwan ngayon are doing the importation.\\nThe citizens of another country cooked their shabu in their — [Anong tawag nitong…?] — in their tugboat or something and they threw out the product in — contained in the plastic bags and with GPS attached to the contraband so that the importers here could find them easily. That is how we are fighting almost losing a battle against drugs.\\nAnd now the [Sinaloa] gangsters of Mexico and the Triad of Laos in that area, they are busy cooking and we have the Filipinos here with no — with nothing in their mind except to destroy a nation — distributes them. That is what I said.\\nI’ve been asked the question and several times I gave the answer. I am a Filipino and I love my country. I do not want my country in disarray because of drugs. I do not want families break up and become dysfunctional. Iyon ang masakit sa akin.\\nWhen there — if you want to destroy a family, look for a way of the member or a resident of that family home, bigyan mo ng droga. ‘Pag nandiyan na ‘yung droga at they are hooked, and that is the end. Sometimes families are separated because of drugs, becomes dysfunctional, at ‘yung mga asawa magpunta doon sa abroad, ika nga, to look for jobs.\\nAnd you know, in the Middle East — I am not attributing it to any particular country — but there are tribes in the Middle East who are employing our Filipina citizens and they are uniform. Everybody who comes here home ask them how many hours of sleep they have? They said it’s only three to four hours and the food is hogwash.\\nAnd they sacrifice because they send money to the families back home and thinking all the time that the money was spent usefully, only to realize when she comes home that that family has already dispersed to nowhere.\\nBakit ‘yan? Because itong mga durugista sa baba, itong peddlers, itong basurero tawag — it’s a street lingo — they look for families na may mga nanay, tatay nagtrabaho — ang tatay or nanay nagtatrabaho sa abroad. And to think na iniiwan nila ang mga anak nila kung saan-saan na lang, to their neighbors at a tender age of three to four, five, it breaks your heart.\\nIiwan lang nila sa kapitbahay kung walang mga relatives. And then when they come back five years, four years after, they now realized that their young sons and daughters have gone into prostitution because of drugs and their boys or the fem — the male are nowhere to be found and into the drug business also. Iyon ang pinakamasakit.\\nMasakit sa akin na ang Pilipina pumunta doon para magtrabaho because sexual abuse in some tribes in the Middle East have this notion that if you are a slave or you are a paid person working for them, sexual abuse becomes part of the territory. Kaya diyan ako pumuputok at nakikita ko ‘yung mga pamilya na sira.\\nAnd to think that they labored without sleep, eating, I said, garbage, and not being allowed to go to their own church to pray for that is prohibited by them. And we have been just because of the money that they get, we just look the other way around. But still being — you know, bothered every night and they… What will happen to the next succeeding group of…? That is why I have in this speech a talk about slavery.\\nPero ‘yan magprangka ako uli, I would never deny and the ICC can record it: Those who destroy my country, I will kill you. And those who destroy the young people of our country, I will kill you. Talagang yayariin kita because I love my country.\\nYou can do it the legal way but it would take you months and years. And you know what? The statistics, I just learned the other night, that plenty of those who are in the middle class have been released from prison despite the fact that they are charged with trafficking, which is non-bailable and most of them are out. Babae pati lalaki ang kaso. And that is why I said I toyed with the idea — I said, if there is still a space — with due respect to the Senate President, he is a good man, he can become a good vice president. He is holy. Ngayon hindi na siya nahuhuli, noon huling-huli siya. But with due respect to Senator Sotto, who is also running for the vice presidency, he is a capable man, a good man and a Filipino. []\\nSige ako tingin sa harap, nandito pala sa likod ko. [] You know when you are old — I have been in politics, mayor for 23 years; five years as a congressman, dito, I worked here; and four years of working as vice mayor for my daughter Sara; and the presidency. I have been in politics almost — 23 plus four, plus four — almost 40.\\nKaya kung — hindi ko na malaman ang seat arrangement dito. Hindi ko alam nandoon pa ang mga Senate President pati… Buti’t na lang hindi ko sinali si Velasco. Baka hindi na ako makabalik doon maya. ‘Di bale, diretso na ako uwi.\\nI have said many times before: The bloodshed caused by the separatist movement in Mindanao is all about correcting the historical injustices suffered by the Moro people since the period of colonization. With the help of Congress, we were able to pass the Organic Law for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, [] finally fulfilling a promise that was decades in the making.\\nOur victory in Marawi is also a testament to how the Filipino’s patriotism is far stronger than any extremist group. As I have said before, many times, there is no room for lawlessness in this country. []\\nRebuilding a better Marawi remains today, still not completed. To Task Force Bangon Marawi, we need to race against time. And you have to finish the necessary work to rehabilitate the war-torn city and bring back its [displaced] families back home.\\nNow let me talk again about the drugs. I was just ahead because I was talking something else. Nag-segue ako.\\nWhile we have made great strides in ending rebellion and insurgency in various parts of the country, we still have a long way in our fight against the proliferation of drugs. This problem has hounded our country for several decades — destroying families and degrading the moral fiber of our society.\\nWhen I assumed office, I committed to end this problem at the soonest possible time. We launched an unprecedented war against the illegal drugs and to destroy their apparatus that permeated every level and sector of society. We waged war on the manufacturers, the financiers, the suppliers, the peddlers, and the entire syndicates and, more importantly, their protectors in government. We have rescued and reformed drug dependents because of their idiotic sense of decency by [launching] interventions and building facilities not only for their rehabilitation, but also to prepare them to reintegrate into society.\\nOur unyielding campaign led to the surrender of millions of drug dependents; and neutralization, capture and prosecution of thousands of drug personalities; the dismantling of illegal drugs and syndicates and the drug laboratories; the extensive drug-[clearing] of communities down to the barangay-level, and the cutting of narco politics.\\nYou know, just allow me a little bit of your time. Wala naman siguro kayong lakad ngayon, unless na you want to — unless you have this appointment with… I’m sure hindi babae ‘yan. That would be a sexist statement. But kung nagmamadali talaga, halos tumatakbo, babae ‘yan. Kung naglalakad lang nang natural, medyo less important ‘yan. Ganoon ‘yan pero dito, wala. I am not making any sexist — I’m just saying — I’m just saying the truth. What is the truth? It’s there for all to see.\\nLet me talk about our quest for infrastructure development.\\nFive years ago, the first thing I made sure was to increase our infrastructure spending to an average of five percent of the country’s GDP. This is significantly higher than the infrastructure spending of each and [of the] past four administrations. Thanks to the comprehensive tax reform program that enabled us to fund critical infrastructure projects. Today, we can see the tangible results all around.\\nMRT-3, with its frequent breakdowns and unloading of passengers midrail, was a horror that was for the daily commuters to endure in the past.\\nNow, MRT-3 no longer unloads passengers but to their destinations. The waiting time between trains has been significantly reduced. [From] 10 trains running at only 30 kilometers per hour before, now [MRT-3] runs 23 trains at 60 kilometers per hour. [] We have taken away the misery of public commuting.\\nWe also pursued the completion of the LRT-2 East Extension Project. [] By extending Line 2 and adding two more stations, we have reduced travel time between Manila and Antipolo from the usual two or three hours to only just 40 minutes. []\\nThanks to our partnership with the private sector, we were able to open Stage 3 of the Metro Manila Skyway in January this year. [] This decongested EDSA and other major roads in Metro Manila. []\\nOn Independence Day last month, we also inaugurated the Kalayaan Bridge, part of the BGC-Ortigas Center Link Project, [] which will reduce the usual one hour travel time between the two business districts to just 12 minutes.\\nBeyond Metro Manila, we are pursuing several high-impact projects that will be completed within my term and perhaps in the following years. It’s a question of money.\\nJust this July, we inspected the newly-built passenger terminal building of the Clark International Airport. []\\nThe new and modern passenger terminal is equipped with the latest state-of-the-art technology. This can accommodate 8 million passengers, alleviate air traffic congestion at the NAIA Airport, as well as serve as a major growth driver and gateway for Northern and Central Luzon. []\\nMadali man ang magpakpak, ang basa ang mahirap. [cheers and ]\\nTo help promote equitable development, we also completed several roads leading to important trade corridors. Last year, we completed the construction of the Poro Point Freeport Zone Road in La Union, which improved — [] nakita na ninyo ‘yan? Wala, sige lang pakpak. [] You do not even have a picture of what I am talking about, I’m sure — to improve access to prime spots for investments and tourism in the Poro Point area.\\nWe also completed the Junction Lanao-Pagadian-Zamboanga City Road, which will provide easier access to farms and easily transport their agricultural products at low cost and in great quantities to industries and economic zones located in Diplahan, Zamboanga Sibugay. []\\nThe Sorsogon City in Bicol, inuna namin ‘yan kasi mahal ko ang mga Bicolano. [] Pangatawanan ninyo ‘yang pakpak ninyo ha, baka…\\nThe Sorsogon City Coastal By-Pass Road is targeted for completion by the end of 2021 while the Davao City Coastal Road will be completed by 2023.\\nBakit? Why? Why is Davao last? Kasi sinabi ko sa kanila, unahin ninyo ‘yung buong Pilipinas. During the initial years of my presidency, I told the economic managers and the DPWH, pati si Art Tugade sa Transportation, “Unahin ninyo ang Luzon at ibang areas sa Mindanao. Do not look into the political entrails of the city and the other provinces.” Sinadya ko talaga na ipanghuli ang Davao.\\nKaya ang — for the Davaoeños, you must understand that we cannot really unahin natin iyong — kasi taga diyan ako eh. Kung hindi ako sigurado taga-Davao, tapos na ‘yan pareho ng iba. Kaya lang sinabi ko, make Davao the last priority. []\\nTotoo ‘yan. Sorsogon is a — a little politics, but that’s the territory of our Vice President Leni Robredo. Are you here, Ma’am? Ah, Zoom. Mayroon ho kayong… [] Sorsogon at iba pa.\\nWe have inaugurated new highways, roads and skyways. We have bought new trains. These are all testament that we have greatly eased the grueling experience of traveling and commuting.\\nAnd to sustain our momentum in infrastructure development, I have directed the DPWH, DOTr, NEDA, Department of Finance and DBM to be on full speed to ensure that our flagship projects will be completed within my term, [] especially those that would help disperse economic activity outside the densely populated Metro Manila.\\nI thus earnestly call upon our LGU and private sector partners to help us [go on] full speed towards the realization of our flagship [infrastructure projects] and others.\\nLet me talk about — let me dwell about governance.\\nAs we improved connectivity, we worked towards greater convenience for our travelers. We have extended the validity of Philippine passports to 10 years to lessen the burden of our [international] travelers and OFWs. []\\nWe have also gone beyond merely addressing the three million backlog of driver’s licenses in 2016. []\\nWe also extended for the new cards the validity of the driver’s license to five years, and addedly, we shall begin the issuance of these driver’s licenses within 10 years — which would be good for 10 years if there is no traffic violation. []\\nSo punta ka doon sa LTO, maybe you have a good sight. Mayroong ano ‘yan eh, I think there’s an examination there somewhere to test your ability to drive safely. And you go back 10 years after, and you think that you good — you still have a good sight and your reflexes are still good.\\nTen years, maraming banggaan ‘yan, sigurado ako. You know, after 10 years, no after five, there should be a stricter measure to issue the 10 years validity of a driver’s license by imposing stringent requirements to test the essential functions of eyesight, then the hearing. Iyong iba hindi na nakakarinig ng silbato eh.\\nAnd so I have to… You know, 10 years is too long. I like it, it’s good. But we should have, as I said, in five years, we should go there for a medical makeover. Tingnan lang kung kaya pa mag…\\nNot only did we extend the validity of licenses and passports, we also sought to make long lines a thing of the past by streamlining government processes. These efforts are embodied in the Ease of Doing Business Act, which Congress passed [in] 2018. Thank you, Congress. []\\nSa inyo ‘yun. Ako ang nagpirma pala, ako nag-execute, pakpak rin kayo. [] Dapat ganoon ang SONA, sabihin mo lahat at sabihin mo na your — not really your qualms, but your misgivings somewhere there.\\n[Government] transactions will be further streamlined with the roll-out of the Philippine Identification System or the PhilSys through the Philippine Identification System Act. With this, we hope to facilitate better access [to basic services] for all Filipinos even in the far-flung areas. I want to say something about this but I’m taking too long, you know.\\nWe also ensured the modification of the Salary Schedule for Civilian Government Personnel through the Salary Standardization Law 5 [] — a necessary measure for our civil servants to recognize their work and accomplishments as well as a gesture of gratitude and good will.\\nWe have this legacy and we hope to pass on the establishment of the Central Business Portal, a single site for all business-related transactions such as securing business permits, licenses, and clearances. Launched earlier this year, it shall elevate our global standing in the doing business arena and improve our country’s competitiveness.\\nAlam mo ito, ‘yung queuing, when I was a mayor — I don’t know, but maybe a legislator or a senator or a congressman, well not really he is higher than the others, but kung dumaan ka as a local government employee worker, just like me, for 23 years, itong queuing matagal ko na ito.\\nIn Davao, ang passport issuances nandoon sa likod ng SM. Isang gabi nag-motor ako, nakita ko ‘yung mga paa sa semento. So I was thinking, “Anong nangyari dito?” So nagbaba ako, sabi ko, “Bakit dito kayo natutulog?” Sabi nila, “You know, Mayor, ang pagbukas niyan kailangan nakapila na kami, ‘pag hindi, sunod — ibang araw na naman kami.”\\nSo I called for the chief of office and I said, “Look I may not be the person above you supervising, but make sure that this thing will not happen tomorrow, as in tomorrow.” Tapos tinawagan ko ang — itong ano, sabi ko, “Why don’t you give cards?” Kung marami sila paglinya, may maglakad na marshal, “O ito, ikaw bukas at 4 p.m.” So you have to study the time and motion of people doing work.\\nSabi ko, “Ayaw ko dito sa Davao.” Because in Davao — in Mindanao, nasa Davao ang ano eh ang issuances ng passport. So ngayon pagka-Presidente ko, sabi ko, “Ayaw ko nang makita ‘yan.” Not during my time, not during my time. Maghanap ka ng ibang panahon. Ayusin ninyo ‘yan. I do not want people queuing under the heat of the sun and rain.\\nKaya sabi ko, “’Di magbigay kayo ng card.” They should go to one window, magkuha kayo kung kailan sila makabalik. So divide — I said, study your time and the motion of, you know, the process of… And dito nangyari na because I insisted.\\nToday, there is no more queuing, especially in the National Office — Statistics Office, nakita ko. Talagang sabi ko na, “Either you fix that thing or I will resign tomorrow because I could not bear to see those people. Hindi sa panahon ko. Kung hindi ko madala, hindi ko man kayo mapatay, hindi ko kayo mabugbog, ako ang aalis sa gobyerno.” Sabi ko, “Ayusin ninyo ‘yan. Hindi ko gustong makita ‘yan.”\\nSince 2016, the Office of the President has issued 138 Executive Orders, 43 Administrative Orders, 86 Memorandum Circulars, 52 Memorandum Orders and 1,038 Proclamations. These issuances have [become] integral guideposts in government administration and development agenda.\\nThe Office of the President has demonstrated careful stewardship of the powers, by initiating reforms. We upgraded and improved the systems and processes to ensure that it can provide the best service to the institution of the presidency and the offices under it and ultimately the Filipino people.\\nTo further promote transparency and accountability in government, we also issued the order on Freedom of Information [that] opens up the records, [] transactions, decisions and issuances of all government agencies. In relation to this, we also have the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission that is tasked to run after corrupt and erring government officials and bring them to justice. []\\nAlam mo, I don’t know if you perhaps have come to know about this. I have ‘yung Pastillas sa ano sa airport. There were 43 personnel involved. I fired them all. Talagang pinaalis ko sa gobyerno. Nagbalot pa nga ako ng pera sa pastillas. Sabi ko kay — “Magbalot ka, lagyan mo ng pera kay ito ang ipakain ko sa kanila.”\\nTinawag ko 43 of them from the Immigration. Mabuti’t na lang nandiyan si Justice Secretary Guevarra so that prevented me from doing it because kung hindi siya dumating — and I never expected him to be there — bigyan ko isa’t isa ‘yung papel at ipakain ko talaga ‘yung pera sa kanila. “Gusto mo ng pera? Hala kainin mo.” That is the best way of… Then, you fire them.\\nCustoms, 73 plus 42. And everyday you have about — we have dismissed about 200 government personnel but some I did not allow the publication because ayaw — may mga pamilya eh.\\nSo of late, ‘yung sabi nila na huwag na lang ano kasi nasasaktan ‘yung mga pamilya. So ngayon, wala na. I have stopped it. But there is no — there is no saying that we cannot reimpose it again for all of these idiots. I still have about a year to go. I will — I will reach you somehow.\\nBut corruption, it’s endemic in government. You cannot stop corruption. Nobody can stop corruption unless you overturn the government completely. If I were the next president, if you think there’s really a need for you to change everybody in the system, then you declare martial law and fire everybody and allow the new generation to come in to work for the government.\\nEh kung hindi mo ganunin, walang mangyari. Nandiyan — it’s in the system eh. Kagaya ng drugs, sino ba namang maniwala na nine — nine generals sa pulis were into trafficking of drugs? And because they are — they are policemen, the charges simply just, you know, disappear there. Because the prosecution, the investigation which form part of the vital documents in court, wala eh. Nobody was investigating because they are also policemen.\\nKaya ‘yan kahirap ang ano. Kaya kung gusto mo itong mga ‘to, talagang… The only way to do it just call them and say, “Look for another job. Don’t — don’t…” Ganoon kahirap.\\nNow, let me pursue my talk with the foreign policy of the country. In the international arena, we have vigorously pursued an independent foreign policy centered on the promotion and protection of our core national interests. Yet… []\\nSigurado kayo sa pinakpakan ninyo? I was just laying the predicate of what I am going to say. Yet we conti — I will just give the cue then you clap your hands. [] If I… Yet we… Biro lang ‘yan ha.\\nYet we continue to work with all nations and seek partnerships that work. Because despite differences, it still is an interdependent world where interests and objectives intersect.\\nNow, partners – heretofore silent or equivocal – have expressed [key] principled positions that echo our own: that [in] disputes and contested areas, the majesty of the law must prevail. And this is most welcome. []\\nTo our friends in ASEAN and around the world: Thank you for supporting my Government, my country and people when it truly mattered. I assure you that the Philippines will remain a responsible member of the international community [] and we will work with you to achieve our shared objectives.\\nBut no mistake — but no mistake… But make no mistake rather, gone are the days when the Philippines decides and acts in the shadows of great powers. We will assert what is rightfully ours and fight for what is rightfully due to the Filipino people. []\\nWe do not have any SONA everyday. Now is as good as any other time to just let it out from sa puso mo.\\nThis is why we sent back container vans of garbage because our country is not a dumpsite. []\\nAnd the first country to do that, hindi ko alam kung bakit, ang Canada. And the container was there for three years because hindi alam ng port authorities kung anong gawain nila sa garbage. And I said, “Isauli mo. I want it done tomorrow. Those containers must be out of our country. ‘Pag hindi, kayong lahat, all of you in Customs, I’ll fire you.” That is a good ground for dismissing people for accepting the garbage. Kaya… May isa pa. Pero let me — let me end the story.\\nThe Balangiga. We welcomed back the bells of Balangiga after many decades because a historic wrong needed to be corrected. []\\nThe deal was I would say I am in bad faith. Sigurado ‘yan. I will admit it. But this is the real story. The Americans — former soldiers, war veterans went to see me — I think that was in Aguinaldo — and some military men. And in no uncertain terms, they said that, “You have been invited by Trump to go to America. Have you decided to go there?” I said, “No.” “Why?” Sabi ko, “I do not like the way that you are treating my country.” “Why?” I said, “For one…” And there was the clamor now of Balangiga. “You return the bells of Balangiga.” That’s a war really sacred also to the soldiers. Then it is more sacred to us in addition to the religion — the Roman Catholic Filipinos — the Church.\\nAng sabi nila, “Why don’t we make a deal?” Si Hogan, he’s an Ame — is he around? He’s a CIA agent. Sabi niya, “Isauli namin, pupunta ka?” Because I said earlier in my presidency, “There will never be a time that I will go to America.” Eh itong mga media mahilig mag-udyok eh. “Ah ganoon, bakit ka hindi pupunta? O arte mo lang ‘yan eh?” Sabi ko, “Then you watch me.” ‘Di gusto ninyong malaman. Sabi ko sa America, “Yes, I might consider going to America.”\\nSo well then, sabi ko, “Work on it.” In just two months’ time, they told me that the ship carrying the Balangiga bells are on their way to deliver it to Quezon. [] You removed it, you put it back there, kayo mismo.\\nSo tulong-tulong sila doon, nabalik na. And this Hogan said na, “Oh, so when are you going to go to America?” Sabi ko, “I do not have the time, but I will go there.” Noong malapit na, hindi na talaga ako pumunta. So… “Well, how about your promise?” Sabi ko, “Well, I lost time to do it. I cannot do it now.”\\nPero talaga, in my mind, and the Americans might know it, I was — there was never in my mind a trip to America. Iyong Balangiga, sabi ko, you massacred one barangay — barrio noon — women and children and all pinatay nila lahat because that bell, Balangiga, was used to call the people for prayers, ganoon. Sa simbahan ‘yun eh.\\nSo ‘yung ginawa nila, every time it is used, the Americans knew that it was — it has a great significance to the Filipinos, the Balangiga. After the massacre of one barangay, how many at the time, we would never know but it was, I said, isang barrio. Noon — barangay ngayon; barrio noon ‘yan eh. Barrio is an American word, the barrio. They also call the small places in Mexico barrio. The Americans borrowed it from the Spaniards, barrio.\\nSo sabi ko, the blood — you really got it at the expense of the blood of Filipinos. I… “Do not hurry me up. If I go to America, it will be in my own time.” Pero actually, wala ako. I have not been to America for almost 10 years, 20 — 22 years. I have not visited America and I do not have any intention of visiting it anymore.\\nWe called on the world to dismantle the heinous kafala system — ito ring isa — because the Filipino is no slave and to anyone anywhere [] and there is no room for modern day slavery. We helped start a new global civil rights movement for the migrant worker.\\nAnd, we asserted the arbitration ruling on the South China Sea — clearly and in no uncertain terms — bilaterally, [at] the ASEAN and finally, at the United Nations General Assembly. []\\nAnd let me talk about [what] I said in the September of last year: the Arbitral Award is now part of the international law and beyond compromise and beyond the reach of the passing governments to dilute, to diminish or abandon. []\\nThat is the problem. Let me now — just to everybody — everybody in the Middle East, I would like to tell them that not only Filipinos but all human beings, the kafala has no place there because it’s a setup for slavery. Either you correct it or we will ask our workers, Filipino workers, to go home.\\nSabi ko bahala na kung mahirap lang kami dito, okay lang. We will try our very best to make up for what they have lost, what they will lose in the process. But we will never allow them to be slaves.\\nBut we need to do more. With our partners, we continue scaling [up] our maritime domain awareness [and] defense capabilities. Yet, we will not close our doors on diplomacy and détente. Because that is how disputes are settled and never by force.\\nLet me… Alam mo, I respect the opinion. You should be aware by now of how I talk, especially on matters of — crucial matters that involved the country. Ito bang arbitral ruling, I’ve said it in — I think in the latter part of the speech — I said that what’s your problem in the arbitral ruling?\\nAmerica and some Filipinos — brilliant Filipinos, I would say — keep on pushing for something, which I really do not know. I have made a speech before the UN, naka-Zoom lang rin, nandito lang ako. Hindi ako pumunta doon. But in that speech, I laid down the bare, sabi ko — ng ating administrasyon.\\nAno pa ang gusto ninyo? What will I do with a document that [does] not bind China because they were never a part of that arbitration? There was really no arbitration at all because it was only the Philippine side was heard. Well and good.\\nBut ito ngayon that there is the arbitral ruling, you know, I do not want to insult these people pushing me for something more than what I can handle. At ano ang gusto nila, makipag-giyera? “Do something.” What do something? Do you want war against China? Well, I’ll tell you, even on the coast beach of Palawan, before you can take off, the missile of China would be there in about five or 10 minutes. It would be a massacre if I go and fight a war now. We are not yet a competent and able enemy of the other side.\\nSo what I did I was just being nice to them. But for some people to say that I was helped by China in being President, these idiots, really. I will never, never do that. Hindi na bale ako hindi ma-Presidente, hindi ko talaga gagawain ‘yan. To be what? Receiving money from China to buy votes? They say that they helped.\\nMaybe in some Chinese communities, the gossip going around was that “support Duterte.” But the whole of the Chinese community in the Philippines went for me. Why? Kasi sa Davao noong mayor ako, ni minsan hindi ako tumatanggap maski Christmas gift.\\nDito marami sa dito sa Maynila Presidente ako ngayon, maraming nagpapadala ng baril, kung anong ano diyan, sabi ko, “Isauli mo ‘yan”. Iyong mga relo. Eh itong aking relo, it’s IWC. This is only 300,000. But the Patek that has come [my] way, isinauli ko talaga. “Return it o ‘pag hindi, itapon mo sa Pasig sa harapan nila.”\\nHindi — hindi ako tinulungan ng China. Nag-usap kami ng China civilly but after election. And after election, I was a good friend of President Xi, until now.\\nWhen the pandemic struck, the first country I called for help was China. President Xi, sabi ko, “Mr. President, we have no vaccination program here because we do not have the vaccines. We have not been able to invent one. We might have a hard time.” He said, “no, it’s okay. We’ll send you.”\\nAnd he send us — donated about 1,500,000 of vaccines. Ganoon, kaya nga sabi ko ako, lalo na kaming mga Bisaya, mabigat sa amin ‘yan, for us Visayans, iyong utang na loob mabigat talaga ‘yan. Hindi mo mabayaran ng ano pero ‘pag may utang na loob ako sa iyo, you can be sure that I will be your friend, a true friend and die for you.\\nPero itong China magdayo, bakit ako magpakamatay diyan? Iyang sundalo ko ubusin ko? How can we fight China? Do we have the weapons? Do we have the — everything?\\nNow comes America, they say that if the attack is against the Philippines, they will defend. But they issued a statement that America does not meddle in conflicts involving the boundaries of other nations. And if America has to go to war, you would have to go to Congress to get — American Congress to get the authority to go to war.\\nThat is why many presidents hindi na lang — it was a — just a mere — an error, a mistake — a malicious mistake. No president has ever been punished for attacking nations, getting into a fight with nothing. And if they come here, well, ang problema kasi nandito na ‘yung Balangiga. Isauli na lang natin uli. Maybe I’ll just return it ‘pag ito’y… It’s no big deal to us. Iyan ang bells, ring it until you die.\\nFulfilling my promise to our coconut farmers and the Filipino people, my administration has worked with Congress to pass the Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act. [] We have returned also the Coco Levy funds to its true and rightful owners — our coconut farmers. [] The fund is now worth an estimated to be 75 billion [pesos], which will be utilized according to the plans and programs in the Coconut Farmers and Industry Development Plan for the direct benefit of the coconut farmers and the development of the coconut industry.\\nIn our effort to ensure that food is within reach of every Filipino family, we worked for the passage of the Rice Tariffication Law in 2019 despite pushbacks. This resulted in the stabilization of rice supply and food prices. The proceeds from the tariffs enabled us to provide our farmers with modern machineries that increased their yield and sustaining the growth in agricultural production.\\nWe also fulfilled our promise to [provide] free irrigation. That was the first promise I made some — in San Miguel, Bulacan when I was campaigning. The farmers invited me to go into the farms inside San Miguel, Bulacan. And we had a sort of a — well, a meeting, and the first thing that they were complaining about was the severity of the irrigation that they have to pay 5,000 every month — ah every year. Si sabi ko, “I will work on it.” Free Irrigation Service Act of 2018 is a product that now lowers the cost of agricultural production, especially for poor farmers.\\nWe also worked to ensure that households have adequate supply of clean water. Potable and affordable water is more than a commodity. It is a vital public good. This is why I used my political capital to fight vested interests behind disadvantageous water service contracts [] that burdened consumers with unjustified water price increases. With the signing of [Revised Concession Agreements] with water concessionaires, consumers will be protected at least until 2037.\\nGanito ‘yan eh, there is this concessionaire, dalawa. Ayaw ko na lang mag-ano — I will not mention names pero this is really what happened. Ang dalawang concessionaires, one in the south and the one is north, as the rich cartel dito sa Southeast Asia, ang kina-capture nila ang electricity pati tubig.\\nDito sa tubig, in this contract with the water concessionaires, we made so many concessions that really, sabi ko, if you look at the contract and look at the Anti-Graft Law, talagang it’s all anti-graft. All of the sentences even the period and the question marks there.\\nAh bakit? Sila walang problema sa tax because the people, consumers, will pay the taxes for them. Sila kung malugi, sabi nila hindi nila kasalanan and we can — I can think of it through not of their own fault, sabi doon bayaran natin sila malugi. We pay for the tax corporation nila at sila ang mag-decide kung i-increase nila o i-decrease nila ang water prices.\\nThe regulators, itong mga regulators sa Pilipinas walang magawa and they acceded to the contract. It was really — I do not know how to put it. Kaya ako nag-pardon, ‘di ba nagmura ako? Sabi ko, biro mo kung malugi sila, babayaran pa natin. Tayo ang — ang corporate tax nila, tayo ang magbayad. And it’s a cartel, that service concessionaires are part of the cartel of Malaysia and Indonesia, and they form part of that mother corporation. Itong mga sa Pilipinas pati sa Malaysia, Indonesia they are just — kumbaga sa istorya, chapter lang ‘yan sila. It’s being controlled up by the…\\nKaya sabi ko, “Wala ito.” I told them — I told Dominguez, “Tell them that I am no longer honoring the contract.” Mayroon pa doon payment of itong tax — water treatment plant to be constructed in the Harrison Plaza site. Iyon ang pinirmahan natin. So 1997 up to the present or up to the month that I blew my top, nagbabayad — ewan ko kung ngayon nagbabayad na. There’s a kuwan there sa water bills ninyo for enhancement of quality water. Ang ibig sabihin water treatment. And they were collecting since 1997 so until now how much of the Filipino’s money are with them for nothing, not even for a song?\\nKaya ako, if there is something — hindi naman proud — but if there is something someday that my children will say: “What have you done for my country?” Sabihin ko, sila. Talagang inupakan ko sila. Sabi ko… []\\nAyaw ninyo? You do not want it? Well, okay, I will — I will just confiscate your system and call the military to operate it. I will exercise the eminent domain and expropriate all of your assets here kasi gagawin ko.\\nIyon ang nangyari sa… So sinabi ko sa military, in one of our meetings immediately after that incident, I said, “If I do not make it to the finish line, kindly — look kindly at the Filipino at tanungin ninyo kung ano na ang nangyari sa kanila, iyang tubig na yan.”\\nNow, there is a new contract. I have not yet — I have to thoroughly digest it inside. I have to absorb it every word of it that the Filipino is protected. ‘Pag nandiyan na ‘yan, then I will sign. But I will not forget, I’m telling them the crime is there already and any Filipino who would want to go after you, can. Sabi ko, “I will not free you, I will not — there’s no way we’re —- in your… I will never allow that. Just make a new contract, just realize everyday that I can call you.”\\nItong frequency, frequency ng ABS-CBN. Iyan ang pinaka-ideal kasi, you know, frequency is everywhere. But there is a spot, kung sa golf, a soft spot na maganda ‘yung… Wala akong problema sa ABS-CBN. They got my money, I’m not… They wanted to return it when the case blew up at they printed all the garbage including my daughter as a drug trafficker. Nilamon ko na lang lahat ‘yun because I never wanted to be — to appear vindictive.\\nBut itong ano… They are cheating government by the billions in taxes. And they still want that frequency because ‘yan ang pinapag-awayan. No. I will give it to a Filipino na gustong maggawa nang tamang ano and pay. Because sa ABS-CBN, ‘yung even their equipment were imported tax-free kaya talaga ako hindi magpapayag. They still owe government billions. In the contract diyan sa nakalagay doon four hectares. So ang binabayaran nila four hectares sa property taxes. Supposed they are occupying 40 hectares, that complex there. Pero ginamit nila na papel ‘yung four hectares. Iyon lang ang binabayaran nila. Kung hindi ba naman… Kaya ko sila inaway. And, well…\\nOur micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs constitute 99.6 percent of our country’s businesses and are vital to economic activity, job creation, and poverty reduction. Ipinaramdam natin ang ating malasakit sa maliliit na negosyante sa pamamagitan ng Pondo sa Pagbabago at Pag-asenso Program. Since 2017, mayroon na tayo niyan. We have the program. The program has provided over 219,000 underprivileged microentrepreneurs with an alternative to the exploitative lending 5-6.\\nIyan ang naka ano sa… You know what, maybe I have to go to — if need be, I have to go to India. Iyong 5-6 nila ng Turko, tinatawag nilang Turko, kung maghiram ka sa kanila ng 10,000, pahiramin ka niyang hindi pera 10,000. Six, seven thousand lang. And the others, mga refrigerator or the things that you do not even need in the house, bilhin mo sa kanila. Sala set, lahat na. That is part of… You do not want the furniture, the refrigerators, they won’t give you the…\\nKaya ang Pilipino nabuktot. Alam mo ang buktot? Naging hunchback na lang sa trabaho, ganoon pa man. Kaya ako, sasabihin ko itong mga Turko, you better come up with a fair scheme if you want to go into business sa money lending, but not at that usu — usury a thousand times.\\nLikewise, to further support development of our micro and small businesses, we [instituted] radical reforms in the tax system to ease the taxation burden and increase the net income of lower wage earners and small businesses.\\nThanks to Congress… [] Iyan hindi pa ninyo alam ha. Sabi ko lang…\\nThanks to Congress and our revenue generating agencies, our tax reforms sustained our economic growth from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2019, which made the Philippines one of the fastest growing economies in Asia until the [] pandemic scourge.\\nIyon talaga ang… Well, I don’t know what’s the plan of God. He sent us something which hit us right in the heart. We see so many — there’s no way of telling when this virus would disappear from the planet of the Earth. We can only pray to God to look into our direction and decide on what will happen to this planet he created.\\nHowever, tax laws are not always perfect and that is why every now and then, they have to be revisited to see if they are at pace with the changing times. Let us therefore continue to monitor the relevance and impact of our tax laws on individuals and private institutions to prevent serious damage on their financial health.\\nGoing now to the social and health issues.\\nTo unburden our people of the hefty costs of tertiary education, my administration worked with Congress to pass a landmark legislation that had remained unpassed for so many years: the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act in 2017 which provides free education to college students in state universities. [] Thank you, Congress.\\nWe also passed the Universal Health Care Act in 2019. And to supplement this, I also signed into law the Malasakit Centers Act in 2019. []\\nKasi ganito ‘yan eh, ‘pag ang pobreng Pilipino nasa ospital, magpunta pa siya doon sa kung saan makahingi ng tulong. So ang ginawa, just like in Davao, ginawa namin ‘yung lahat na kailangan, ‘yung Internal Revenue kung nandiyan, business permit, diyan na lang sa isang lugar, medisina, kunin nila. Diyan mismo sa ospital, hindi na sila maglakad-lakad. And to me, that is one of the most — let me find the word — a poignant act of Congress and of the executive department. []\\n[This] legislation, which was sponsored by Senator Bong Go [] — if you feel like standing up, you can, Senator, [] mas sikat ka pa sa guest speaker — [has] unburdened our people of the tedious process of going to various agencies and offices in order to avail of assistance from government. I am pleased to report that we have already established 130 Malasakit Centers across the country [] that has already helped millions of Filipinos in their hospitalization needs.\\nBy establishing Malasakit Centers all over the country, we have actually levelled the playing field and provided our less fortunate countrymen the medical care they deserve. We will be establishing more. God willing, if we are still around.\\nSa pagtatag ng Malasakit Center, hindi na po kailangan lumapit at humingi ng tulong sa iba’t ibang ahensya ng gobyerno. Ang gobyerno na ang lumalapit sa tao. []\\nSo let us talk about COVID. It’s mentioned everywhere in the speech, but what — what’s this g**d*** virus is?\\nI have to admit: back when I decided to answer your call and run for higher office, never, never did I imagine that my presidency would not only be judged by how I made good on my campaign promises in fighting illegal drugs, criminality, and corruption but by how well I led our nation dumake — during rather, the global pandemic.\\nHindi na ako maka-pronounce mabuti baka mayroon na ako. [ and ] May ambulansya ba diyan? Mukhang iba na ang… You know, I cannot pronounce the words. I hope this is not asymptomatic. []\\nPrior to the pandemic, we recorded our lowest debt-to-GDP ratio since 1986, the highest revenue effort since 1997, the highest credit rating in the country’s history — ‘yung sa bangko — because if your rating is high, it’s easy to borrow at maliit lang ang interest, that is the dynamics of a rating by Fitch — Fitch and [Standard] & Poor’s, mga ganoon — and the lowest rates of unemployment, underemployment, and poverty, well it’s still there. It is beyond dispute that our economic and governance fundamentals were robust when COVID-19 hit us.\\nI am sure that much can be said about the way we took on the daunting challenge of preserving lives while sustaining our momentum towards [our] developmental — dito na lang ako — goals. Naturally, we prioritized saving lives. Buhay muna bago ang lahat. Ibig sabihin, inuna natin ‘yung gastos — ‘yung pera natin sa pandemic. Kinuha ng — lahat ng anong mga budget. Si Dominguez ‘yan. Iyon ang ginamit ninyo sa Bayanihan 1 and 2. Doon natin kinuha ‘yung pera.\\nWe moved quickly to safeguard the well-being of every Filipino through preventive and responsive health and safety measures, and broad and inclusive social amelioration programs or SAP. Thanks to the support of Congress, we launched the most extensive Social Protection Program in our country’s history, with the passage of Bayanihan 1 and Bayanihan 2. []\\nIndeed, our national health system and resilience were tested to the hilt. Countless lessons were learned and continuous improvements put in place. Kahit anong krisis ay kayang malampasan, kung tunay na may malasakit at bayanihan. I agree.\\nAt the early stages of the pandemic, our testing capacity was very limited. Recognizing the importance of conducting more tests to ensure early detection and timely isolation of confirmed COVID-19 cases, we ramped up our testing capacity. We now have more than 260 accredited laboratories nationwide which is capable of conducting at least 50,000 tests daily. All regions now can conduct their own COVID-19 tests.\\nTo take care of mild and asymptomatic cases, we established over 9,000 temporary treatment and monitoring facilities across the country, with a total bed capacity of more than 140,000. Together with local governments and the private sector, we quickly established mega quarantine facilities that could accommodate more cases. Modular hospitals and quarantine facilities have also been established nationwide, especially in Metro Manila.\\nFor our severe COVID cases, our tireless healthcare workers ensure that you are provided with the best care round the clock, based on latest developments and global best practices. Our health experts continue to actively participate in the search for safe and effective COVID-19 medicines.\\nWith the help of Congress… Kita mo sa lahat. I never said, wala kang makikita, “that, I, [garbled] the key construction of a bridge that is nowhere to be found today,” iyong mga ganoon. Ako, sa inyo talaga.\\nWith the help of Congress, we passed 13 measures that established new and improved the capacity of existing hospitals around the country to provide quality care and services to our people, especially amid the ongoing [COVID-19 pandemic]. []\\nThese include establishing new medical facilities in Mandaluyong City, Bacolod and Davao Occidental; increasing bed capacities of existing health facilities in Quezon City, Ilocos Sur, La Union, and Palawan; [and] upgrading health facilities in that area to include Leyte.\\nCurrently, we have received over 30 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. We expect [to receive at least] 36 million vaccines this month and in August. We have inoculated more than [17] million Filipinos [] — [around 11 million] of which have received their first dose. At least 17 million.\\nWell, I think the landscape — the health landscape of the country continues to improve as we, you know…\\nWith the continuous [arrival] of COVID-19 vaccines, we are ready to boost further our daily vaccination rate. I am also encouraging our local government units to hasten their roll out and strengthen their inoculation program. San Juan City, for one, [will] have vaccinated 70 percent of their population in a month’s time. Saludo ako sa inyo [] at kay Mayor Zamora.\\nWe cannot continue living in the shadow of this potent enemy, especially now that science and medicine has proven that it is possible to live with — if not entirely defeat — this virus. The health and safety protocols we put in place have proven effective in slowing the spread of the virus. But the best solution is still vaccination.\\nAm I too… Mataas na ba? Kasi kung mataas na, putulin na lang ninyo itong gumagalaw dito para sabihin ko, eh wala na man akong mabasa. ‘Pag matagal na… Those who want to go home, you raise your right hands. [ and ] Pati si Monsignor baka itaas niya ang kamay niya eh. []\\nThat is why I implore our countrymen who are now in the list of sectors to be inoculated to get vaccinated now. To those who received their first doses, please return for your second shot.\\nI also ask for patience to those who are next in line to receive their vaccine. More and more COVID-19 vaccines are arriving each week and you will soon have your turn.\\nCorollary to this, it is high time that clear, precise and uniform protocols and guidelines are issued in anticipation of the vaccination of more Filipinos and the steady reopening of our society.\\nYou know, pagpasensyahan ninyo ako. I… I ask… I beg your kind indulgence. But I have to say this — to talk about something which would affect us all. Iyang… It seems that this government is too far away from the people. Iyong serbisyo talaga na totoo.\\nNoong isang araw, nakita ko, I don’t know what place was that. Ang mga tao nakapila and they say that they were there at 4 o’clock, lumalakas ‘yung ulan, sa payong lang sila. So nanonood ako sa report because I listen to the report every morning. Makukuha mo sa mga radio station ‘yan eh. So I was having breakfast. I was listening to the TV, at nakita ko ‘yung mga tao nakapila, lumalakas ang ulan. Sabi ko, “P***…” Eh doon sa breakfast table, nagmura ako. Pero dito good boy man ako kay may mga religious diyan baka…\\nI thus call on the National Task Force Against COVID-19 to see to it that this happens — I mean the protection. We have spent enormous amounts of resources to build our capacities to overcome this pandemic. We cannot afford more lockdowns lest our economy bleeds to the point of irreversible damage.\\nBalikan ko ‘yung ano, bakit mo papilahin? At sabi kasi doon libre lahat na, wala ng ano. So nagpuntahan ‘yung mga tao na nagpila kasi wala nang lista-lista pero sabi ng mga ito, alas kwatro pa sila. T*** i**.\\nHindi lang ako puwedeng mag… Alam mo sa totoo lang, hindi naman ako nagyayabang. I am just an ordinary Filipino citizen. Just like you, I get hurt when people are nearly almost brutalized. Bakit hindi ka magkuha?\\nIt’s rain time. Malakas ang monsoon — southwest monsoon. Dumadaan talaga sa Pilipinas. Gamitin mo ang utak mo. You should look for a gym at bigyan mo lahat ng tao ng number. Hanggang dito lang for this… Hanggang dito lang tayo, balik kayo itong bukas from 15 to 20, kayo na naman bukas.\\nBigyan mo ng card. Prepare a card where you can — the marshal will go around the queuing na… Bakit mo…? Hindi ko maintindihan — there’s media — hindi ko maintindihan bakit gawain mo ‘yan sa Pilipino? Iyan ang tinatanong ko. Why do you have to do it to the Filipino? You can always — you know, maghanap ka ng… Tsk.\\nThere is always a gymnasium. Mga eskwelahan walang klase ngayon. Bakit hindi mo gamitin doon? Bakit ka maghanap ng isang room…? T******** na… Kaya lang ako… Well, it is my — to my chagrin because I’m… Gusto kong lumabas. Itong PSG lang na ito ang…\\nYou know, sabihin ko sa inyo, huwag kayong mag-presidente kay wala talagang… Sabihin ko maliit ang suweldo, wala ka. If you are not there really for the — mag-corrupt ka diyan, well, it would make you a billionaire overnight. But kung magtrabaho ka lang ng ganito…\\nAko Presidente, gusto kong lumabas doon, sabihin ko, “Hoy, mga p***** i** ninyo, bakit ganito ‘to? Bakit ganoon kayo ka-estupido?” I mean, the Filipino does not deserve it even if they are not paying taxes. Because the theory of government is that all money belongs to the people and the money is there, it belongs to all of us and it should be used for public good. But what — what is the use of public good if you are not good and stupid? So ganoon ang mangyayari sa Pilipino.\\nI’m just letting off my… Kasi kung hindi lang talaga bawal, eh itong PSG hindi ako pinapalabas. Magsabi ako magpunta ako doon, “Sir, hindi puwede ‘yan, hindi puwede.” Kulong talaga ako. Mag-presidente ka, sa totoo lang you are a prisoner. You are brought here, kunwari ka pa de-chopper ka, de-guwardiya, tapos uwi ka doon sa bahay mo, tapos hindi ka na makalabas. Preso ka talaga.\\n“Tawagin mo ‘yung security, ‘yung gusto kong pumunta…” “Sir, hindi. Pasensya na.” Tapos pagalitan mo, sabihin, “Sir, eh ang authority namin does not come from you, it comes from a law so kami ang masunod.” Talagang… Sige ka pirma a bunch of papers. If you read it hanggang umaga trabaho ka. Suweldo mo ganoon lang. Just give me 219,000 tapos ganoon ang trabaho mag-isa ka. Buti’t ngayon kay nandito ‘yung asawa ko, nandito ‘yung anak ko. Nabubuhay ‘yung loob ko mag-uwi ako sa bahay ngayon. Tsk.\\nLooking forward, today is my last State of the Nation Address, but this is by no means my swan song. I shall never cease to implore Congress to pass vital and critical legislation as well as push the entire government to ensure nothing less than the full recovery and revitalization of our country.\\nBut to do this, it is necessary for us to first overcome the crippling fear, anxiety and uncertainty that caused — that was caused by the threat of the COVID-19 virus.\\nWell, I really do not know what to do. I have to listen to the Task Force. This is a group of people volunteering to be a collective advisor that would give you the advice collectively, we put it that way, na sila ang mag-ano, magsabi. And we’re just waiting for the word.\\nI am referring to COVID D, Delta. It is rampaging now in Indonesia, Thailand, India, and many parts of Asia. And ang sabi doon sa — the Western medicine says that it is far more aggressive and far more dangerous and it can cause death easily than the COVID-19 original.\\nSo this is as good as any other time to say it, if sees that it is really dangerous, you have to go back to lockdown. If there are many people in other parts of the world killing as many, then Delta, if ever it will spread — we have it here now — I hope it will not go any further. But if something wrong happens, I’ll have to be strict and I have now my word that there will be a… Just like what happened in the early days. Eh kung ganoon ang COVID D, saan tayo pupunta?\\nAnd if there is — it requires a new vaccine, we do not have it yet, I do not know what… Maybe we will just have to pray for salvation. Sabihin natin, “Diyos, we have done everything. But you know, this time we are really put hard on these things that happened.”\\nRest assured that we will exert every effort to restore the lost livelihood of our affected countrymen. I have recently signed an Executive Order creating the task force that will shepherd the country’s National Employment Recovery Strategy.\\nThe Task Force recently partnered with the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines to implement the Reform, Rebound, and Recover Program that aims to vaccinate qualified workers to fill in more than one million jobs.\\nThese jobs will be created by different business associations in the fields of construction, information technology, BPO, and electronics. To our business associations, thank you for joining in our effort to bring back lost income opportunities for our workforce.\\nAnother important component of our employment recovery strategy is the retooling of our workers to prepare them for better job opportunities. Since the start of community quarantines, over [1.2] million [individuals] availed of the TESDA’s free online training programs.\\nI am directing the National Employment Recovery Strategy Task Force, particularly TESDA, to ensure the upskilling of our workers and increase their employability. I expect the task force to work double time not only to recoup job losses, but more importantly to rehabilitate the economy and help our hardest hit sectors [recover].\\nThrough the COVID-19 Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program, we released 988 million pesos worth of loans to over 14,000 enterprises [under] Bayanihan 1. [Under] Bayanihan 2, we released 2.9 billion pesos worth of loans to over 12,000 enterprises including our displaced OFWs and enterprises in the tourism sector to help them start or sustain their businesses amid the pandemic.\\nAlong this line, I would like to renew my call to Congress to immediately pass the amendments of priority legislative measures such as the Foreign Investments Act, the Public Service Act, and the Retail Trade Liberalization Act. []\\nYour  went well ahead of its realization. You have to work on this guys and well I am sure that we can have a respite of this contagion in a — in your own little way.\\nFinally, I would like to reiterate my call for Congress again to pass legislation to establish a single agency that shall focus on and respond quickly to the needs and concerns of our OFWs. I pray that our next leaders and our future generations will not squander our natural resources and fight for the integrity of our environment, in a manner fiercer and more effective than my administration had ever done.\\nThe pandemic has taken so much from us as a nation but like [all] other adversities that tested us time and again, it can never take [away] our courage and resilience. And the spirit of Bayanihan 1 — rather, bayanihan and the value of malasakit are now indelible in us Filipinos. We shall use these gifts to forge ahead towards a better normal.\\nAs we come to a point where the risk of COVID-19 transmission can, to a certain extent, be managed, I am hopeful that we shall be united in forging ahead towards bringing the country back to its robust growth path.\\nLet me end by adding these particular statements. Well, on learning — education and learning.\\nDespite our inability to conduct face-to-face classes during this pandemic, we remain determined to deliver quality and accessible education to all. The creation of the Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan enabled the uninterrupted learning of students in the basic education sector while ensuring their and teachers’ health, safety, and well-being.\\nWhile the pandemic has demonstrated the readiness, resourcefulness and capability of government to serve the Filipino people through the use of ICT and digital services, it has also shown its inherent deficiencies and weaknesses. As such I ask Congress to pass an E-Governance Act that will set up the transition of government processes to the digital age.\\nI would like to add something on the protection of our overseas Filipinos.\\nI also ask Congress to pass a law creating the Department of Migrant Workers and Overseas Filipinos [] — kailangan po ito because they are suffering not on — they suffered not only yesterday but they are still suffering now with so many inadequacies, in both our government response including the monetary assistance — to ensure that there is a department that is solely focused on addressing the needs and taking care of the welfare of our countrymen abroad.\\nBefore I end, let me also touch on the environmental protection.\\nIt has also been 13 years since the Supreme Court, through a mandamus, ordered the rehabilitation of Manila Bay. Unfortunately, no immediate substantial action to comply with the Supreme Court’s order was undertaken until 2019, when this administration started its long overdue rehabilitation.\\nAs of May [2021], all illegally operating open dumpsites surrounding Manila Bay have been shut down, while 151 out of 187 LGUs surrounding the Bay now have access to sanitary landfills.\\nEstablishments have been forced to comply with environmental laws and ordinances while those who did not have been closed down.\\nAs a result, pollutants have been largely reduced and coliform levels — also reduced to its barest maximum — are now on its lowest levels in years if not decades. I urge the DENR to sustain its efforts and continue working with our LGUs to restore Manila Bay to its former glory. []\\nYou know, just one little thing before we end. Iyong pag-ano sa Manila Bay, well, there is a corner where all the garbage con — by current — by action of the current, nandito marami sa likod ng Luneta.\\nGinawa natin ‘yan at nilagay natin itong ‘yung puting bato na which is, well, scattered into small pieces. Eh nawawala minsan ‘yan because of the waves.\\nSo every now and then, we still have to replenish because we cannot change the nature of our shores. That is how it is. It is not a permanent fixture there, [dolomite]. It is there from the mountains and we break it down and bring it to the sea.\\nBut that would occupy that place irrespective of there is a high tide or low tide. Nakakatulong ‘yan at nawawala ‘yan. And the only way to do it is to replenish it until we can think of a good alternative of how we can process the whole thing back to its normalcy. If there was really normalcy at the time or at any other time in the past.\\nOn the resilience. Again, dinagdag ko na lang ito. Time is good and as any other time again to ask you.\\nIn line with this, we hope to pursue the creation of public entities dedicated to managing emerging and re-emerging diseases. I thus fervently ask Congress to enact a law creating the Center for Disease Prevention and Control and the Virology and Vaccine Institute of the Philippines.\\nWe must… [] Maski gaano natin kahirap, however poor we are I think that the Filipinos, given the proper support and the things there, the equipment that they have to use, we can — I am sure that the Filipino brain can also process or make vaccines in the future. []\\nTapos na po ‘yan, ma’am. I ask Congress to pass the — ‘yan — Disaster Resilience Act that will create the Department of Disaster Resilience.\\nLet us also — pagkatapos nito, ma’am, ikaw ‘yung unang tao na mag-congratulate sa akin ha. Kaya ako nagka-utal-utal dito eh dahil sa iyo.\\nLet us also pass the law implementing the Fire Protection Modernization Program to bolster the readiness of our firefighters and ensure their ability to respond to fires and disasters. Related to this… [] Importante ‘yang trabaho ng bumbero maniwala kayo. They must also be there during any disaster happening.\\nLet us also push for the Mandatory Establishment of Evacuation Centers in every city, province and municipality throughout the country, which shall provide the basic needs and assistance to all evacuees during times of emergency.\\nNow, there is now the conclusion. Sabi, “Hay, salamat.” [] Sabi, ” P*****g Duterte ‘to oh.”\\nThe lights go out for this administration eleven months from now. The work that we started and expected to finish within the constitutional time frame of six years has been stalled. Much was hoped for. But we need not despair. Desperation is a feeling alien to the resilient Filipino.\\nA peaceful and prosperous Philippines is no longer a distant dream but one that is within our grasp if our future Filipinos would also do it — if would continue the — if they would continue and would seize the opportunity to work together.\\nMalaki ang pasasalamat ng mga kababayan natin at lagi nilang sinasabi na mas panatag ang loob nila ngayon. Hindi na nababahala ang mga magulang na lumalabas ang mga anak nila at naglalakad sa gabi. []\\nI will not elaborate on anything. You can draw your conclusion. Alam mo, when the Filipino, a father, a mother, or a child, naglalakad sa gabi at siya ay — kagaya ng iba, even in America, you go into the inner cities of L.A. and New York, you — sa Washington D.C., there’s a corner there, there’s a — do not go there because you will not come out alive. Ganoon, kung hindi maglakad na sila puro takot na lang ang nasa loob nila ma-holdup sa jeep tapos pati ‘yung taga Ombudsman na buntis patay pa pati ‘yung bata sa loob ng tiyan.\\nJust to get the money to buy shabu because when the monkey is riding on your back, iyong katawan mo hindi mo na maano, that is why you need to higop — sip, kailangan mo maghigop at kailangan mo pumatay ‘pag wala kang pera. Hindi naman talagang papatay, maybe not. The mind is not ready for that but in the struggle, you put up a struggle if you are the owner of the money, eh talagang papatayin ka ‘pag hindi mo ibigay.\\nIyan ang ayaw ko kaya noong na-mayor ako sa Davao, ganito, mga p***** i** — mga p****** i** niyo, umalis kayo sa daan, ‘yung daan, ‘yung public transportation is for public good. Huwag mo silang takutin na magkanto ‘pag uwi, nandiyan nag-iinuman sa — iyan ang hilig ng Pilipinong — mag-inuman. Hindi mo malaman ang mga nag-uwi na babae, they have to take another route that would be longer because nandiyan mga istambay.\\nSo the streets are unsafe, hino-holdup, pinapatay. Sabi ko doon sa Davao — sa Davao na lang, huwag na lang ako dito sa Maynila, hindi naman talaga ako nakikialam dito pero alam nila, alam ng pulis kung ano ang gusto ko.\\nMag-prangkahan tayo. Sabi ko sa pulis, “Isauli mo ‘yan.” The roads, the highways are for law-abiding citizens of this country. Iyong mga kriminal, ‘yung mga — well, the dregs of society, huwag ninyong gamitin ‘yang mga daan, hindi para sa inyo ‘yan. And I will see to it that you are not there, be sure that when I pass by, I do not see you. Because if I see you, I will dance with you. Isauli ko.\\nKaya ngayon medyo hindi naman talaga ano but ‘yung mga sales girl ng mga — mga shopping center eh panatag na ang loob nila at least ang chances of being mugged, murdered, and raped. Iyan ang ayaw ko. ‘Pag malayo nakahigop na, kunin ‘yung pera, hilain doon sa medyo maliit na mga grassy portion and rape at papatayin. Iyan ang hindi ko matanggap. Just like ‘yang Pilipino sabi ko…\\nI may be — I may be just a little bit crazier than the others but that is what I am. Ayaw ko ‘yung — lalo na mag — mag-shabu ka tapos mag-pasyal ka kung ano wala kang makuhang pera, aakyat ka ng bahay. Just like that bank teller, it was raining so hard just like the rains that we had experienced. It was pouring almost cats and [dogs], ang lakas talaga nang bagsak ng ulan. She went home to knock the door and pump the door loud but ang parents nilang matanda — matanda na ‘yung parents, hindi nakarinig.\\nSo anong ginawa nitong ma — mga sa construction workers? Sabi ko diyan nga ako galit sa droga eh. Nabibili nila mura. It’s 200, 300, susuyupin nila at ‘pag nakasuyop ng droga ‘yan, maghanap ng alcohol ‘yan. Sigurado ‘yan. ‘Pag tama ng alcohol pati ‘yung ano ng droga it shrinks the brain, ‘yon. Iyong babae dinampot — she was just picked up and brought to the construction site near the house tapos ni-rape doon, pinatay, sinunog pa.\\nIyan ang hindi ko talaga maintindihan. I cannot reco… Iyong bata na 3-year-old rape-in mo. Ang problema nito, ang nakikita nila ang patay na mga kriminal. Well, how about the victims on the other side? Bakit hindi ninyo tingnan and see what these criminals have done to our children, to our wives, and daughters?\\nMay listahan kayo p**… Ang listahan ninyo doon sa namatay hindi ba kayo maligaya niyan wala ng kriminal? Pero ‘pag tingin mo dito ilan ang patay na inosente? Pati pulis ko at sundalo namamatay diyan baka akala ninyo kriminal lang. So that is my lamentations and I just want you to hear.\\nIn my five years in office, we made real change in governance through the reforms we pursued. However, for this governance — must be sustained and broadened. We need to make…\\nI’m not — I’m just getting my air. Naghihingal ako. Baka — baka dito ako mamatay pagka-Presidente. Iba na ang pitik ng ano ko ngayon ng kasing-kasing ko. Kasing-kasing is puso.\\n[We need] to make every public servant responsive to the needs of the people and enjoin every Filipino to assert their right to demand malasakit from their leaders until everyone lives with dignity — well-fed, educated, healthy, secure, disciplined, and empowered — to contribute to national development.\\nI will not be forever be President. But ang kulang sa Pilipino is assertiveness. ‘Pag may — mayroon kayong transaction at hingian kayo, ang sabi ko sa inyo, ito ang payo ko, murahin mo, sabihin mo, “P***** i** ka, nagtatrabaho kayo at kami dito. We are following papers and you are sitting on your a** on it.”\\nKaya dito, sabi ko, makinig kayong lahat ng Pilipino tutal last SONA ko na ito, ‘pag may mag-follow up kayo, permit, clearance, at maghingi ng pera, murahin ninyo. Sabihin ninyo, “’Yan, sabi ni Duterte sampalin ko kayo kasi ako nagbabayad ng buwis, bakit ginaganito ninyo?”\\nAnd to the mga Pilipino, hindi naman lahat, tayong nagtatrabaho sa gobyerno, I mean it takes you one month to process a paper, it takes you — tapos pabalik-balik ‘yung tao. ‘Pag ang tao bumabalik, dalawa, isa, tatlo, then there is corruption there. Murahin mo, at kung maaari, pahiramin kita ng pangkulam para kulamin mo.\\nGanoon talaga. I’m just warning everybody, there’s still one year to go. In Davao, three days. Lagyan mo ng papel, “Bumalik ka dito at this hour on Thursday.” At pagka naipakita mo ‘yung papel, hanapin niyo ‘yung ibibigay. Iyan ang gamitin ninyo, for all the local governments also.\\nIn my Cabinet, it’s 30 days, walang extension. All. Sabi ko, you reduce the signing authority from six, seven, to only one or two. Hindi naman pala kailangan… [] Hindi kailangan magpirma lahat ng empleyado diyan, one or two. Iyong iba mag-process lang.\\nBut if you cannot process it also in so many days, in Davao, if you sub — if it is a clearance, which is long overdue, hindi mo na puwedeng ibigay doon sa tao. Ibigay mo sa akin at tanungin kita, “… mo, bakit inabot ka ng ganito?” Wala — there is no other conclusion. Corruption ‘yan.\\nKagaya… What is true in Davao is true for the entire Philippines. Mabuti’t na rin ‘yan nakapagsalita ako ng freely with you tutal last ko naman na itong SONA. Mabuti ‘yang malaman ng tao na ganoon ang ginagawa nila. It’s not there. Hindi man — hindi man nila lalagay ‘yang mga ganoon na, wala mang mura diyan. Be careful this is…\\nWe need to fight to subdue narrow vested interests and ensure that our gains will [redound] to the benefit of the greater number of Filipinos, especially those who have the least in life.\\nWe have laid down the groundwork and are continuing to push for landmark reforms and key accomplishments up to the last days of my term. I have full confidence that the Filipino spirit…\\nPati ako nagmamadali na. Eh naiihi na kanina pa eh. [ and ] It’s a natural human biology so what’s the big deal? Bakit kayo magpakpak kung napaihi na ako? [ and ] Sabagay, alam ko rin, nahihiya kayong magtindig. Puno ang pila nito pagdating sa CR mamaya. []\\nI have full confidence that the Filipino spirit will persevere and triumph. Together, let us rise as a nation. Thank you. []\\n— END —\\n  \n",





                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\nSTATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS\\nOF\\nHIS EXCELLENCY FERDINAND R. MARCOS JR.\\nPRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES\\nTO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES\\n[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 25, 2022]\\n \\nVice President Sara Zimmerman Duterte; Former Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and Rodrigo Roa Duterte; Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo and the honorable Justices of the Supreme Court; the Apostolic Nuncio Most Reverend Charles John Brown and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; the honorable members of the Cabinet; our First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos and our children []; distinguished guests; ang mga minamahal kong mga kababayan; ladies and gentlemen; magandang hapon po sa inyong lahat.\\nI come before you today to address you, as it is my duty as President of the Republic.\\nWe live in difficult times brought about by some forces of our own making, but certainly, also by forces that are beyond our control.\\nBut we have, and we will continue to find solutions.\\nAnd these are some of them.\\nIn terms of the economy, we will implement a sound fiscal management.\\nTax administration reforms will be in place to increase revenue collection.\\nExpenditure priorities will be realigned, and spending efficiency will be improved to immediately address the economic scarring arising from the effects of COVID-19, and also to prepare for future shocks.\\nProductivity-enhancing investments will be promoted.\\nOur country must become an investment destination, capitalizing on the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or the CREATE Law and the economic liberalization laws such as the Public Service Act and the Foreign Investments Act.\\nEcozones will be fully supported to bring in strategic industries such as those engaged in high-tech manufacturing, health and medical care, and all emerging technologies.\\nThis is also seen to facilitate economic growth outside of Metro Manila.\\nOur tax system will be adjusted in order to catch up with the rapid developments of the digital economy, including the imposition of value-added tax on digital service providers.\\nThe initial revenue impact will be around Php 11.7 billion in 2023 alone.\\nTax compliance procedures will be simplified to promote ease of paying taxes.\\nWe will pursue measures to determine possible undervaluation and/or trade misinvoicing of imported goods.\\nThrough information and communications technology, the Bureau of Customs will promote streamlined processes.\\nDisbursements for 2022 to 2023 will be maintained at above 20 percent of gross domestic product or Php 4.955 trillion and Php 5.086 trillion, respectively, to ensure continuous implementation of priority programs.\\nDisbursement will further increase over the medium-term from Php 5.402 trillion or 20.7 percent of our GDP in 2024 to Php 7.712 trillion or 20.6 percent of GDP in 2028.\\nThe Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy of this administration seeks to attain short-term macro-fiscal stability while remaining supportive of the country’s economic recovery and to promote medium-term fiscal sustainability. Furthermore, and more importantly, fiscal policy aims to bring together the National Government’s resources so that these are mobilized and utilized in order to gain the maximum benefit and the high multiplier effects for our economy.\\nMeasurable medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal objectives include the following headline numbers. These are based on forecasts that are consistent with the guiding principles of coherence of strategies, policy discipline and fiscal sustainability.\\n\\n6.5 to 7.5% real gross domestic product (GDP) growth in 2022; 6.5 to 8% real GDP growth annually between 2023 to 2028\\n9% or single-digit poverty rate by 2028\\n3% National Government deficit to GDP ratio by 2028\\nLess than 60% National Government debt-to-GDP ratio by 2025\\nAt least 4,256 USD income (GNI) per capita and the attainment of upper middle-income status by 2024\\n\\nThe aforementioned headline goals summarize the objectives of this Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFF) being submitted to Congress, for its adoption and concurrence through a Concurrent Resolution by the Senate and House of Representatives.\\nOnce adopted, the MTFF will become an anchor for the annual spending and financing plan of the National Government and Congress when preparing the annual budget and undertaking related appropriation activities. It is therefore a forward-looking document that extends beyond the traditional three-year horizon to reach six (6) years, coinciding with the six-year coverage of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023 to 2028.\\nThe MTFF also promotes transparency and credible commitment to pursue the indicated socio-macroeconomic goals that optimize the government budget.\\nMedium-term growth targets and the assumptions regarding key macroeconomic variables underpin the medium-term fiscal plan. The recent past and the COVID-19 pandemic has beset the macroeconomic environment with challenges and a series of external shocks. Inflation has accelerated in recent months due largely to significant increases in international prices of oil and other key commodities.\\nStill, the economic growth momentum remains firm as demonstrated by the strong 2022 first quarter GDP growth at 8.3 percent. However, the recovery process from the impact of the pandemic is still on-going amid elevated uncertainty in the international economic environment. Revisions in the macro-economic assumptions incorporate these challenges and most recent economic developments, leading to upward adjustments in the following:\\n\\nInflation rate for 2022 to 2023;\\nForeign exchange rate for 2023 to 2025; and\\nGoods and services imports growth for 2022\\n\\nThe economy is expected to grow by 6.5 to 7.5 percent this year as we continue to reopen the economy while considering the recent external developments.\\nIn the first quarter alone, GDP saw an increase in household consumption and private investments, along with a robust manufacturing industry, high vaccination rate, improved healthcare capacity, and an upward trend in tourism and employment. This is expected to continue for the rest of the year. This strong economic growth is projected to be sustained and expanded further to 6.5 to 8 percent from 2023 until 2028.\\nThe average inflation for 2022 is projected to range from 4.5 to 5.5 percent, following the uptick in fuel and food prices as a result of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and the disrupted supply chains.\\nIt is slightly adjusted to 2.5 to 4.5 percent in 2023, and is seen to return to the target range of 2.0 to 4.0 percent by 2024 until 2028.\\nDubai crude oil price is expected to settle at 90 to 110 USD per barrel in 2022, 80 to 100 USD per barrel in 2023, and 70 to 90 USD per barrel from 2024 onwards as oil supply is expected to catch up and stabilize over the medium-term.\\nThe Philippine peso is projected to average between 51 to 53 PhP per US dollar in 2022 and 51 to 55 PhP per US dollar from 2023 onwards due to aggressive monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve, market aversion amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and again, increased global oil prices.\\nLastly, exports of goods are expected to grow by 7 percent in 2022, and 6 percent from 2023 to 2028.\\nOn the other hand, imports of goods are projected to grow by 18 percent in 2022, 6 percent in 2023, and 8 percent from 2024 to 2028.\\nI have instructed the NEDA to coordinate with other agencies and work on the Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028 and to submit to me the complete blueprint and progress of its implementation not later than year-end.\\nOne of the main drivers of our push for growth and employment will be in the agricultural sector.\\nWith regard to food supply, we are confronted by a two-pronged problem: that which will hit us in the short term and that which will hit us in the long term.\\nTayo ay nahaharap sa mga problemang kagyat nating mararamdaman at mga hamong pang-matagalan.\\nAng mga suliraning agarang mararamdaman ng ating mga kababayan ay ang posibilidad ng tuloy-tuloy na pagsipa ng presyo ng pagkain at kakulangan sa suplay ng ating pagkain.\\nUpang masuportahan ang mga mamimili para mapanatili ang kanilang purchasing power o kapangyarihan sa pagbili, isinapinal ng Department of Agriculture ang planong taasan ang produksyon sa susunod na panahon ng pagtatanim o planting season, sa pamamagitan ng tulong pinansiyal at teknikal.\\nMagbibigay tayo ng pautang, habang mas ilalapit natin sa sektor ng agrikultura ang hindi gaanong mahal na farm inputs na bibilhin na ng bulto ng gobyerno.\\nKabilang dito ang abono, pestisidyo, mga punla, feeds, fuel subsidy at ayuda para sa mga karapat-dapat na benipisyaryo.\\nPara sa pang-matagalang solusyon: itataas natin ang produksyon ng mga kalakal at produktong pang-agrikultura. At para magawa ito, pagtitibayin natin ang tinatawag na value chain na nagsisimula sa mga magsasaka hanggang sa mga namimili.\\nMay mga bahagi ng value chain na sa ngayon ay kanya-kanya ang operasyon. Pagtibayin natin ang koordinasyon ng iba’t ibang bahagi nito.\\nAng pagsasaliksik para sa mga makabagong paraan ng pagtatanim at pag-aalaga ng hayop ay masusing gagabayan ng Department of Agriculture.\\nAng produksyon ng farm inputs o mga kakailanganin ng mga magsasaka sa pagpapalago ng kanilang sakahan ay ating iaayon sa mga hamong dala ng climate change at global warming.\\nMahigpit na pagsusuri ang gagawin ng ating mga eksperto tungo dito.\\nAng mga pautang at financial assistance sa mga magbubukid at mangingisda ay magiging institusyon at patakaran ng aking administrasyon. []\\nIpaprayoridad natin ang modernisasyon ng mga sakahan sa pamamagitan ng mga makabagong teknolohiya para sa ating mga magsasaka. Ating palalawakin ang mga palaisdaan, babuyan at manukan. Lahat ng ito, gagamitan ng siyensya para tumaas ang produksyong agrikultural. []\\nMaging ang post-production at processing ay susuportahan ng pamahalaan.\\nGagawa tayo ng national network ng farm-to-market roads upang mas mabilis na mailakbay ng mga magsasaka ang kanilang mga produkto sa mga pamilihan.\\nAt gagawa tayo ng mga paraan upang maramdaman ng mga mamimili ang pagluluwag ng presyo ng mga produktong pagkain sa kayang halaga, gaya ng muling pagbubuhay ng mga Kadiwa Centers.\\nHindi ito magagawa sa isang araw, hindi magagawa sa isang buwan, o isang taon lamang.\\nNgunit kailangan na natin simulan NGAYON. []\\nAng agrarian reform program ay dapat magpatuloy.\\nAgrarian reform is not only about acquisition, but also about support services and distribution.\\nTo assist this, I intend to issue an executive order to impose a one-year moratorium on the payment of land amortization and interest payments. []\\nThis is included in Republic Act No. 11469 or the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.\\nA moratorium will give the farmers the ability to channel their resources in developing their farms, maximizing their capacity to produce, and propel the growth of our economy. []\\nThe civil society organizations also support this because it will unburden the farmers of their dues and be able to focus on improving farm productivity.\\nCongress must also pass a law that will emancipate the agrarian reform beneficiaries from the agrarian reform debt burden, thereby amending Section 26 of Republic Act 6657.\\nIN THIS LAW, THE LOANS OF AGRARIAN REFORM BENEFICIARIES WITH UNPAID AMORTIZATION AND INTEREST SHALL BE CONDONED. []\\nLayunin ng batas na ito ay burahin ang hindi mabayarang utang ng ating mga magsasaka na benipisyaryo ng agrarian reform.\\nAgrarian reform beneficiaries who are still to receive their awarded land under the comprehensive agrarian reform program shall receive it without any obligation to pay any amortization. []\\nThe condonation of the existing agrarian reform loan will cover the amount of 58.125 billion pesos benefiting 654,000 agrarian reform beneficiaries and involving a total of 1.18 million hectares of awarded lands. []\\nExecutive Order No. 75, Series of 2019 requires that all government agencies, bureaus, departments and instrumentalities to turn over agricultural lands to qualified agrarian reform beneficiaries.\\nAt present we have a total of 52,000 hectares of unused agricultural lands of the government which shall now be used for distribution to the following sectors in accordance with Section 40 of the Republic Act No. 6657, as amended, thus:\\n\\nLandless war veterans\\nLandless surviving spouse and orphans of war veterans\\nLandless retirees of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police\\n\\nAgricultural lands acquired under this program will be given to graduates of college degrees in agriculture who are landless. []\\nThe call of the times is for the infusion of fresh and new blood in the agricultural sector. We need a new breed of farmers equipped with modern agricultural technology able to engage in sustained scientific farming that will not only increase farm yields, but also resilience in the face of climate change. []\\nThey say that each brand has a story. As for the Filipino brand, ours is deeply rooted in our rich cultural heritage and the tourism sector plays an invaluable role in the promotion of the Filipino brand.\\nTourism is not only an important economic development tool but the abundance of opportunities that the sector creates in terms of regular employment and even job creation at the grassroots level is undeniable.\\nTo boost our tourism industry, we will first and foremost make basic developments such as road improvements for easier access to tourism spots. We will also upgrade our airports and create more international airports [] to help decongest the bottleneck in the Manila Airport.\\nWe will also make it more convenient for travelers to go around the country, even to remote areas to help promote undiscovered tourist spots. This program will be led by the Department of Tourism, together with the Department of Public Works and Highways. []\\nTo foster the Filipino brand is to spark our sense of pride and reaffirm our strong sense of identity. It is time to welcome the rest of the world with an enhanced Filipino brand that is unique, attractive, and creative.\\nThe creativity of the Filipino is truly world-class. We excel in arts and culture, new media, live events — avenues which generate primary and downstream jobs for our creative and talented countrymen. Unfortunately, ang mga hanapbuhay na ito ang unang pinadapa ng pandemya at ang pinakahuli namang makakabalik sa normal.\\nThe creative industry likewise faces many challenges including workplace conditions, working hours, intellectual property rights, and the welfare of our beloved freelancers who were left vulnerable during the height of the pandemic.\\nWe require an institutionalized creative industry that will advance the interests of its stakeholders — sila na nagbibigay ng kaluluwa at [pagkakilanlan] sa ating pagka-Pilipino. Protektahan natin sila. []\\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development has a large part to play in all of this.\\nMagpapatuloy ang ating pagkalinga sa ating mga kababayan na lubos na nangangailangan.\\nHindi po natin sila pababayaan.\\nMangunguna sa pag-aagapay sa kanila ang Department of Social Welfare and Development.\\nUtos ko sa DSWD ang mabilis na pagtugon sa pangangailangan ng mga biktima ng kalamidad at mga iba’t ibang krisis.\\nAng mga field office nila ay inatasan na maagang maglagak ng family food packs at non-food essentials sa mga LGU, bago pa man manalasa ang anumang kalamidad.\\nMagdadagdag tayo ng mga operations center, warehouse at imbakan ng relief goods, lalo na sa mga malalayong lugar na mahirap marating.\\nTitiyakin natin na maayos ang koordinasyon ng DSWD at Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development ng sa ganun, madali ang pagpapatupad ng Emergency Shelter Assistance program para sa mga biktima ng kahit anong kalamidad. []\\nPagtitibayin pa natin ang komprehensibong programang ‘Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situations’ o ang ating tinatawag na AICS, para maiparating ang tulong sa mas maraming biktima. []\\nHindi natin papahirapan ang mga biktima ng krisis na dudulog sa ahensiya — gagawin nating simple ang proseso ng paghingi at pagpaparating ng tulong. Dahil hindi naman dapat dinadagdagan pa ang hirap na nararanasan ng ating mga mamamayan.\\nUpang matiyak na mapupunta sa kwalipikadong mga pamilya ang tulong ng pamahalaan sa pamamagitan ng 4Ps o Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program, titiyakin natin na malilinis ang listahan ng benipisyaryo. []\\nHigit na sa isang milyong pangalan na ang naka-graduate na sa listahan. At nagagalak akong mabatid na sila ay nakakatayo na sa kanilang sariling paa.\\nKaugnay nito ay inutusan ko ang DSWD na pag-ibayuhin pa ang pagrepaso ng listahan upang maitutok ang pamimigay ng sapat na ayuda sa mga lubos na nangangailangang pamilya.\\nMagpapatuloy ang supplemental feeding program para sa mga bata sa Child Development Centers at Supervised Neighborhood Play, at lalo pa nating palalawakin sa taong 2023. []\\nHindi rin natin nakakalimutan ang mga solo parents at mga nanay na nahiwalay sa kanilang mga mister dahil sa karahasan.\\nPagtitibayin natin ang programa sa Violence Against Women and Their Children, kabilang na ang counselling para sa mga biktima, katuwang ang ating mga LGU.\\nTiyakin natin na sapat ang pondo sa halos pitumpong residential care centers at pitong non-residential care centers para sa vulnerable sectors at persons with disabilities na sumisilong dito.\\nSa ating sitwasyon ng pangkalusugan, nariyan pa rin ang banta ng COVID-19, lalo’t may mga nadidiskubreng bagong variants ng coronavirus. Pero hindi na natin kakayanin ang isa pang lockdown. Wala na tayong gagawing lockdown. []\\nDapat nating balansehin nang maayos ang kalusugan at kapakanan ng ating mga mamamayan sa isang banda, at ang ekonomiya naman sa kabilang banda.\\nNakikipagtulungan ang iba’t ibang ahensya ng pamahalaan sa pag-monitor sa mga COVID-19 hospital admission upang makatiyak tayo na may sapat na kapasidad ang ating health care system at maiwasan ang pagsipa ng bilang ng nagkakasakit.\\nPatuloy din ang ating vaccine booster rollout para sa ating pangkalahatang depensa. []\\nSa ganitong paraan, kahit pa tumaas muli ang bilang ng mga COVID cases, mananatiling mababa ang bilang ng mga maospital at bilang ng mga namamatay.\\nSa pamamagitan nito, unti-unti rin tayong masasanay na nariyan ang virus pero hindi na seryoso ang banta sa ating buhay.\\nIaayon natin ang ating mga health protocols sa kung ano ang ating pangangailangan sa paglipas ng panahon at lalo pang iibayuhin ang kooperasyon kasama ang pribadong sektor upang tumaas pa ang kumpyansa ng mga mamumuhunan, nang sa gayon ay bumalik na tayo sa “full capacity” lalong-lalo na ang ating mga negosyo. []\\nPagbubutihin pa natin ang pagpapakalat ng tamang impormasyon ukol sa COVID, kasama ang kahalagahan ng bakuna.\\nMananatili muna sa ngayon ang ating Alert Level System natin. Pinapag-aralan natin ang ibang paraan ng klasipikasyon upang mas babagay sa kasalukuyang sitwasyon lalong-lalo na sa pagbabago ng COVID.\\nSa pakikipagtulungan ng Kongreso, itatatag natin ang ating sariling Center for Disease Control and Prevention at ang isang vaccine institute. []\\nMagtatayo tayo ng dagdag na mga health center at ospital.\\nBut beyond the issues that the pandemic has brought, the need for a stronger health care system is self-evident. We must bring medical services to the people and not wait for them to come to our hospitals and health care centers. []\\nNapakinabangan natin nang husto ang malalaking specialty hospitals gaya ng Heart Center, Lung Center, Children’s Hospital at National Kidney and Transplant Institute. Kaya maliwanag na na hindi lang dapat dito sa National Capital Region, kundi maging sa ibang parte ng bansa… [ and cheers] Maliwanag na hindi lamang dapat dito lamang sa National Capital Region kundi maging sa ibang parte ng bansa kailangan magdagdag ng ganitong uri ng mga pagamutan. []\\nBukod dito, upang mailapit natin ang health care system sa taumbayan nang hindi sila kailangang pumunta sa sentro ng kanilang bayan, lalawigan o region, ay maglalagay tayo ng mga clinic, mga RHU na pupuntahan ng mga doktor, nurse, midwife, medtech, isang beses, dalawang beses sa isang linggo — nang sa gayon, magiging mas madali sa may karamdaman na magpapagamot nang hindi na kailangang magbiyahe nang malayo. []\\nOne of the cornerstones of a strong healthcare system is the provision of competent and efficient medical professionals. We will exert all efforts to improve the welfare of our doctors, our nurses, and other medical frontliners. []\\nDapat din tayong magkaroon ng sapat na suplay ng gamot na kinakailangan sa pang-araw-araw ng ating mga mamamayan.\\nSinimulan ko na ang pakikipag-usap sa mga kumpanya ng gamot dito sa Pilipinas at sa ibang bansa. Hinihikayat natin na buksan nila ang merkado upang bumaba ang presyo ng gamot. []\\nHalimbawa, kung mas marami ang mas murang generic o hindi branded na gamot sa merkado, mas bababa rin ang presyo dahil sa kumpetisyon.\\nAng Department of Trade and Industry ay nakikipag-usap sa mga interesadong manufacturer ng generic drugs na papasok sa ating bansa. []\\nInuutusan ko naman ang Philippine Competition Commission na pantay-pantay dapat at walang kartel sa hanay ng mga pharmaceutical companies. [ and cheers] Dahil kapag bukas ang merkado, bababa ang presyo ng gamot para mapakinabangan ng ating mga mamamayan.\\nThis is one of the hard lessons that we learned when the pandemic struck, and therefore, we must act on that shortcoming. []\\nIn the educational sector, I believe it is time for our children to return to full face-to-face classes once again. []\\nThe Department of Education, led by our highly able Vice President Sara Duterte, [] is now preparing for its implementation in the upcoming school year, with utmost consideration for the safety of students, as we are still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWe must ensure that our classrooms are safe for teachers, for students, and the entire academic community when they return to face-to-face classes.\\nWe continue to encourage everyone to get their booster shots in preparation for the resumption of in-person classes. []\\nThis is one of the reasons I have directed the Department of Health (DOH) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to undertake another rollout of booster shots. []\\nThe condition and availability of school rooms for our students must also be addressed, again, in coordination with the Department of Public Works and Highways.\\nThough some complications have arisen over the question of repair of school buildings in relation to the Mandanas-Garcia ruling, this will be ironed out.\\nWe have been in discussion with local government leaders, Governors and Mayors, in the last few weeks to determine, with the LGUs, what is actually practicable, what functions belong to the LGUs and what belong to the National Government.\\nThere have also been lengthy discussions on the continuation and viability of the K to 12 school system. We are giving this a careful review, and all necessary inputs and points of view are now being considered.\\nIn the longer term, we are instituting a program of refresher courses and re-trainings for our teachers so they can stay abreast of the rapid growth in technology, especially in this post-pandemic world. []\\nAs for the ‘horror’ stories that we have heard about the poor quality of educational materials and supplies that are being given to our schools — this must end! []\\nOur children must always be equipped with the best that we can provide.\\nAng edukasyon ay ang tangi nating pamana sa ating mga anak na hindi mawawaldas. Kaya anumang gastusin sa kanilang pag-aaral ay hindi tayo nagtitipid. Hindi rin tayo nagtatapon.\\nAnd once again, I am not talking about history, or what is being taught. I am talking about materials that are necessary for effective teaching in this day and age.\\nChildren now need connectivity to the internet; they need devices to use; they need computers, educational tools [] so that they might participate fully in the digital community here and abroad.\\nWe must do better in the international rankings especially when it comes to the so-called STEM subjects: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.\\nThese skills and this knowledge are necessary for our young people to be able to compete in a highly technological and competitive world.\\nThe raw talent is there in our young people. It is up to our educational system to develop and to refine that great pool of talent. []\\nForeign employers have always favored Filipino employees because of our command of the English language. This is an advantage that we must continue to enjoy.\\nThe internet has now become the global marketplace. Not only for goods services but also for ideas, even extending to our own personal interactions.\\nThe language of the internet — for better or for worse — is English.\\nTherefore, the question of our medium of instruction must be continuously re-examined to maintain that advantage that we have established as an English-speaking people. []\\nOn a related subject, we are entering an age of exponential adoption of technology. It is the Fourth Industrial Revolution.\\nThis will be characterized by the infusion of technology into almost every facet of our lives. Breakthrough technologies in the areas of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, nano technologies, the internet of things, robotics, self-driving electric vehicles, 3D printing, Virtual and Augmented Reality, among others that will radically transform the way business is done.\\nThe scale and the speed at which these innovations are introduced universally into our everyday lives and activities is unprecedented in our recorded history.\\nWe cannot stand idly by.\\nThe mission of our Department of Information and Communications Technology is to identify and utilize these innovations to improve governance.\\nIt has the daunting task now of transforming our government into an agile bureaucracy that is responsive to the needs of the public, provide good and solid data to ensure informed decision-making, as well as allow secure and seamless access to public services.\\nThe voluminous records stored in the government warehouses and archives have to be digitized. Those that are already stored in various inventories of data should be harmonized and shared across departments and agencies.\\nNeedless to say, these have to be kept in large data centers that are secure yet accessible.\\nThe National ID will play an important part in this digital transformation. []\\nFor citizens to be able to seamlessly transact with government, their identity must be easily verifiable.\\nWe expect to issue 30-million physical IDs and 20-million digital IDs by the end of this year. [] The target is to accomplish the issuance of about 92-million IDs by the middle of next year.\\nAs the world moves into rapid digitalization, the digital divide will become more pronounced. The depth and breadth at which these technologies will be transformative in our lives is fully expected.\\nThis will open new opportunities for the creation of wealth but will also likely create inequalities.\\nHence, universal connectivity will be a vital component in order to ensure that no citizen is left behind. []\\nI have therefore tasked the DICT to deploy digital connectivity across our various islands. This will be done through the implementation of the National Broadband Plan, the common tower program, connecting our Geographically Isolated and Disadvantaged Areas (GIDA) via our ‘Broad Band ng Masa’ project. []\\nAll relevant modes of digital transport should be utilized. These may be through a combination of terrestrial or submarine fiber optics, wireless and even satellite technology.\\nAs our Public Service Act has opened the doors and removed the restrictions on foreign investment, we foresee an increase in direct investment of overseas players.\\nThis will translate into better quality, availability and affordability of telecommunications services all over the country.\\nWe come now to infrastructure. The backbone of an economy is its infrastructure.\\nThe infrastructure program of the Duterte administration must not only continue but, wherever possible, be expanded. []\\nWe shall confidently build on this firm foundation established by my predecessor. As it is in building an edifice.\\nWe must keep the momentum. And aspire to BUILD BETTER MORE.\\nNecessarily, infrastructure development will remain a very high priority in our drive for growth and employment.\\nOnce again, I will not suspend any of the ongoing projects as those have already been shown to be of benefit to the public that they serve. []\\nWe will continue to study the proposals that have been made.\\nInfrastructure development spending will be sustained at 5% to 6% of GDP.\\nThe planned expansion of infrastructure projects, I believe, would be possible if we continue to encourage the participation of the private sector in the development of our programs.\\nPublic Private Partnerships or PPPs hold great potential for that expansion, [] for infrastructure development and for innovation.\\nOur infrastructure development is of primary importance as it is a necessary element to improve many other sectors — to include agriculture, tourism, general economic activity, and even to governance.\\nIt is my belief also that we have missed some great opportunities to develop our rail transport system.\\nIt is clear in my mind that railways offer great potential as it continues to be the cheapest way of transporting goods and passengers.\\nWe can build upon already existing lines by modernizing these old railway systems.\\nThere are dozens of railway projects – on the ground, above the ground, below ground, not just in Manila, but in other regions – at various stages of implementation, and with a combined cost of 1.9 trillion pesos. []\\nThis Administration is committed to finish building the current portfolio of investments: approved railway projects such as the North-South Commuter Railway System, [] the 33-kilometer Metro Manila Subway Project, the 147-kilometer North-South Commuter Railway System, the 12-kilometer LRT-1 Cavite Extension, [] the 23-kilometer MRT-7, and the Common Station that will connect LRT-1, MRT-3 and MRT-7.\\nAnd beyond NCR, larger scale railway systems like the 102-kilometer Mindanao Railway Project; [] the Panay Railway Project; [] and the Cebu railway system will be integrated as a vital part of our transport and communications systems.\\nWe will also continue to improve our roads and transportation systems in key cities throughout the country through various projects such as the Cebu Bus Rapid Transit, Davao High Priority Bus System, Ilocos Norte Transportation Hub, and the El Nido Transport Terminal. []\\nMy order to the Department of Transportation or DOTr is really very simple: FULL SPEED AHEAD! []\\nImproving our railway system, along with modernizing existing airports and seaports, will maximize our strategic location in the Pacific. And connect our many islands.\\nA key sector in our transformation plans is that of energy.\\nAnother fundamental requirement for growth and increased employment will be the availability of cheap, reliable energy. This even comes under the category of “ease of doing business”. If we are to attract investors, both local and foreign, to set up shop here in the Philippines.\\nAt present, our demand for energy far exceeds our reliable supply. We must increase the level of energy production. We must look at every possible option that would be appropriate for the Philippine situation. There is some room to expand our present power supply through existing power sources, but this is only to a very limited extent. We must build new power plants. [] We must take advantage of all the best technology that is now available, especially in the areas of renewable energy. []\\nOur search for new power sources should always be with an eye to improving the mix of the energy supply between traditional and renewable sources.\\nThe technology on renewable energy is progressing rapidly. And many of these technologies are appropriate for the Philippines. We have already begun windmill power. We are now expanding very quickly our solar power production.\\nFor both offshore and on-shore wind turbines, for example, the World Bank has calculated that there is the potential of 255 gigawatts by the year of 2030. []\\nSolar power has steadily increased its efficiency in converting sunlight to electrical power, which is particularly attractive for the Philippines. Because unlike wind power, solar power is practical almost everywhere in the Philippines all year round.\\nIn the move to lowering our carbon footprint caused by energy production, our advancement to renewables will have a lead time.\\nIn the interim, natural gas will hold the key. We will provide investment incentives by clarifying the uncertain policy in upstream gas, particularly in the area close to Malampaya.\\nThis requires clarification of the processes and review of service contracts policy.\\nI believe that it is time also to re-examine our strategy towards building nuclear power plants in the Philippines. []\\nWe will comply of course with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regulations for nuclear power plants as they have been strengthened after Fukushima. In the area of nuclear power, there have been new technologies developed that allow smaller scale modular nuclear plants and other derivations thereof.\\nOnce again, PPPs will play a part in support as funding in this period is limited. []\\nFurthermore, we must examine the entire system of transmission and distribution for the purpose of finding ways to lower the price of energy to the consumer and to industry.\\nWe must expand the network of our transmission lines while examining schemes to improve the operation of our electrical cooperatives. All this in aid of reducing energy cost especially but not limited to households. []\\nAll this impetus for development and growth, we undertake within the context of accelerating climate change and extreme weather conditions.\\nThough we are a minor contributor to climate change globally, we have the unfortunate distinction of being one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change.\\nFor the welfare of our people, it is incumbent upon us to alleviate the effects of that vulnerability.\\nThe use of renewable energy is at the top of our climate agenda. We will increase our use of renewable energy sources such as hydropower, geothermal power, solar, and wind.\\nGeographically, we are a disaster-prone country. Capacity building for our natural disaster resiliency is therefore a must. Investment in science and technology is imperative to enable us to have accurate weather forecasts and on-time disaster alerts.\\nStudies show that already now many areas in the Philippines are at high risk from the rise in sea levels brought about by the increase in global temperature. We must adapt to this phenomenon with disaster-proof planning of our communities.\\nWe will also look into the precarious fresh water supply situation in the country, especially in our urban areas. Many of our water supply systems date back to the 1950’s, and they must now be rehabilitated and improved.\\nI have instructed the DENR together with the DPWH, to explore possible partnerships with the private sector to address this crucial situation.\\nThe Philippines has excellent laws on the environment, but we have to guarantee that these laws are properly enforced. And this will require a great deal of coordination and cooperation between concerned government agencies and private stakeholders.\\nCompanies who exploit our natural resources must follow the law. We all have the responsibility to preserve this Earth, for we are but custodians, and we will pass on this great treasure to future generations. []\\nThere is no question that the preservation of the environment is the preservation of life. []\\nIf we cannot mitigate climate change, all our plans for the economy, all our plans for our future, will be for naught.\\nBawat Pilipino sa ibayong dagat na nagsasakripisyong lisanin ang kanyang pamilya sa Pilipinas upang mag-hanapbuhay ay nararapat lamang magkaroon ng pamahalaang matatawag nilang “tahanan” habang nasa ibang bayan. []\\nIto ang papel na gagampanan ng Kagawaran ng Manggagawang Mandarayuhan o Department of Migrant Workers matapos itong ideklara bilang ganap na ahensiya ng gobyerno noong isang taon. []\\nAng kagawarang ito ang magsisilbing kanlungan ng ating mga kababayan sa gitna ng mundong walang kasiguruhan at mahigpit na kumpetisyon. Ito ang maglalatag sa kanila ng mga oportunidad; titiyak na ang kanilang mga hanapbuhay ay tugma sa kanilang mga kasanayan; maninigurong akma ang sahod at maayos ang kalagayan sa kanilang mga kumpanya; at mangangalaga sa kanilang mga pamilya habang sila ay nasa malayo.\\nGagawin natin ito sa pamamagitan ng pag-aalis ng red tape sa sistema ng pagsusulong ng digital empowerment. We shall automate the verification of contracts and issue secure Overseas Employment Certifications (OEC) that you can keep on your smartphone. I call on the Department of Migrant Workers and the DICT to make this a top priority. []\\nTinatawagan ko rin ang Department of Foreign Affairs na makipagtulungan sa Department of Migrant Workers na tiyakin ang lahat ng mga diplomatic post ay tutulong na agarang maibalik sa trabaho ang mga ating mga Overseas Filipino workers na nawalan ng hanapbuhay nitong nakalipas na ilang taon. []\\nMula sa tatlong buwan ay gagawin na lang nating tatlong linggo para sa isang dayuhang employer na i-proseso ang mga papeles ng Pilipinong nais nitong kunin bilang empleyado. []\\nAatasan din natin ang kagawaran na gawing simple ang kumplikadong handbook ng mga tuntunin at regulasyon para sa mga OFW, nang sa gayon ay maging maalwan ang mga transaksyong may kinalaman sa kanilang pangingibang-bansa.\\nMula sa handbook na may dalawang daan at apatnapung (240) seksyon ay gagawin nating pamphlet na lamang na hindi hihigit sa isandaang pahina. []\\nMahirap na nga ang buhay, kaya naman ayaw pa natin makitang lalo pang nahihirapan ang ating mga manggagawang mandarayuhan sa pagtupad sa kanilang mga pangarap.\\nPara sa mga kababayan nating naiipit sa kaguluhan, inaabuso, at nanganganib ang buhay, ikinagagalak kong sa ilalim ng aking pamumuno, ay ilulunsad natin ang One Repatriation Command Center o ORCC. Ilalaan natin ang isang social media platform ng Department of Migrant Workers at ang hotline upang matulungan agad at mailigtas sila mula sa mas higit na kapahamakan. []\\nNoon, nangungutang pa ang isang ina ng bawat OFW upang sumakay ng barko para pumunta sa Maynila at mangatok sa iba’t ibang ahensiya para mapauwi ang anak na inaapi. Ngayon, kami na ang tatawag sa mga magulang ng OFWs [] para sabihin sa kanila ang petsa kung kailan nila mayayakap at makakapiling ang kanilang mga anak. []\\nSa kasalukuyan ay nakikipag-ugnayan tayo sa pamahalaan ng Saudi Arabia upang buksang muli ang deployment. Kaya natin, at gagawin natin, ang makipag-negosasyon na mabigyan ang ating mga kababayan doon ng tamang pasahod, at mapangalagaan ang kanilang karapatan at kapakanan.\\nMuli nating pagtitibayin ang respeto at pagkakaibigan ng ating dalawang bansa tulad ng namagitan sa aking ama at sa kanilang hari.\\nSa mga susunod na buwan ay magtutungo si Secretary Susan Ople sa Saudi Arabia upang tiyakin na may sapat na puwersang magsisiguro na mabubuksang muli ang empleyo sa bansa, [] at para maisulong ang ating kampanya laban sa human trafficking.\\nNgayon, para naman sa mga anak na naiwan sa Pilipinas. Titiyakin ng Department of Migrant Workers, sa pamamagitan ng OWWA, na sila ay maipapasok sa magagandang paaralang magtuturo sa kanila ng financial literacy, mental wellness, sports, sining at kultura. Ito ay mangyayari sa pakikipagtulungan ng iba’t ibang ahensiya ng pamahalaan. Alagaan natin ang kabataang Pilipino sapagkat sila ang kinabukasan ng ating Inang Bayan. []\\nSa ating mga kababayan na nasa ibang bansa: You deserve a Home in Government not only for the money that you send home, but you are not cold tools of the economy. You deserve it for your sacrifices, for our country and your perseverance and excellence in the global arena.\\nYou, OFWs, represent the fighting faith of the Filipinos as a nation and as a people. Let us transform your overseas journey into inspirational stories for all time.\\nThanks to you, our dear legislators, and of course, to the man, every OFW now refers to as their “Tatay”, President Rodrigo Duterte. You passed the law that created this new home for our OFWs. []\\nOn the area of foreign policy, I will not preside over any process that will abandon even one square inch of territory of the Republic of the Philippines to any foreign power. [ and cheers]\\nWith respect to our place in the community of nations, the Philippines shall continue to be a friend to all, an enemy to none.\\nThe Philippines has always been open and welcoming to all our foreign friends and visitors. That is our world view, that is our culture.\\nBUT LET ME BE CLEAR. WE ARE VERY JEALOUS OF ALL THAT IS FILIPINO. []\\nWe will be a good neighbor — always looking for ways to collaborate and cooperate with the end goal of mutually beneficial outcomes.\\nIf we agree, we will cooperate and we will work together. And if we differ, let us talk some more until we develop a consensus.\\nAfter all, that is THE FILIPINO WAY.\\nBut we will not waver. We will stand firm in our independent foreign policy, with the national interest as our primordial guide. []\\nWe commit to maintaining good relations with the rest of the world.\\nAs a matter of fact, it is my sincere belief that the need for strong bonds and collaboration among nations emerges in the direst of times, such as in a pandemic.\\nThe partnerships and alliances that we make with all will provide the stability that all nations will need as we emerge into this new global economy.\\nThe Philippines will continue to promote stronger and multi-faceted relationships with all our partners around the world.\\nWe are, in fact, grateful for the messages of support and offers of help that we have received from many of our friends in the international community. This has been communicated to us through the different Envoys and the Ambassadors here in the Philippines.\\nSuch strong relationships can only be beneficial to all involved.\\nAs I am here today addressing the legislature, allow me now to propose legislation that we would like you to pass in support of these programs:\\n1. National Government Rightsizing Program (NGRP) []\\nA reform mechanism that seeks to enhance the government’s institutional capacity to perform its mandate and to provide better services, while ensuring optimal and efficient use of resources.\\nCompared to previous government reorganization efforts, the NGRP will entail a comprehensive strategic review of the functions, operations, organization, systems and processes of the different agencies, and massive and transformational initiatives in agencies concerned, such as mergers, consolidation, splitting, transfer, and even the abolition of some offices. The rightsizing efforts will also involve the conduct of a comprehensive strategic review of functions, programs and projects that will cut across various agencies.\\n2. Budget Modernization Bill\\nThis seeks to institutionalize the Cash-based Budgeting System (CBS) under Executive Order No. 91, Series 2019 to strengthen fiscal discipline in the allocation and use of budget resources by ensuring that every peso budgeted by the government would lead to the actual delivery of programs and projects.

[]\\n8. The Establishment of a Medical Reserve Corps\\nEstablishes a Medical Reserve Corp (MRC) under the Health and Emergency Management Bureau (HEMB) of the DOH. The MRC shall be composed of licensed physicians, medical students who have completed their four (4) years of medical course, graduates of medicine, registered nurses, and licensed allied health professionals.\\n9. National Disease Prevention Management Authority\\nThis bill seeks to create the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC), attached to the DOH. []\\n10. Creation of the Virology Institute of the Philippines\\nThis will create the Virology Science and Technology Institute of the Philippines (VIP) as an attached agency of the DOST. All offices and units under the DOST with functions related to virology shall now be transferred to the Virology Institute of the Philippines.\\n11. Department of Water Resources\\nThis seeks to create the Department of Water Resources and adopts the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) as the strategic framework for national water management, policymaking and planning.\\n12.

To attain such unification in a democracy, the military plan must be supported by popular intelligence, confidence, and enthusiasm. It is a special function of Government to see that this confidence is fairly earned and assiduously sustained. To this end let us see to it that every law we pass and every military measure we adopt shall reflect an unselfish and national purpose, that it shall impose injustice on none, and that it shall promote the security and defend the peace, the possessions and the liberty of all.</td>\n",

By our political education, by our convictions and by our inclinations, we are a democracy. We have established a democratic system of government and the perpetuation of this system will depend upon our ability to convince our people that democracy can be freed from those vices which have destroyed it in some countries, and that it can be made as efficient as any other system of government known to man.

The reason for this is simple. A large proprtion of the boys and girls who have been admitted to the schools have not remained long enough to acquire any kind of useful knowledge.\n",

I am sure that every one of you will give to this noble task the best that is in him. An opportunity has been offered us that no past or coming generation has had or will ever have –that of creating a nation where there will be no privileged class, where poverty will be unknown, where every citizen will be duly equipped with the knowledge that will enable him to perform his duties and to exercise his rights properly and conscientiously, and where every man, woman, and child his fireside will be thankful to God for living in this beautiful and blessed land.\n",

       "4 0          As a final word respecting the Army, I want to urge you, once again, to give to all matters concerning our future security the earnest consideration their fundamental importance deserves. If eternal vigilance is the price of freedom, let us then be ceaselessly vigilant. Our defensive system requires no unusual sacrifice by any individual, but its success depends primarily and almost exclusively upon a unification of the efforts of all toward this common and vital purpose. To attain such unification in a democracy, the military plan must be supported by popular intelligence, confidence, and enthusiasm. It is a special function of Government to see that this confidence is fairly earned and assiduously sustained. To this end let us see to it that every law we pass and every military measure we adopt shall reflect an unselfish and national purpose, that it shall impose injustice on none, and that it shall promote the security and defend the peace, the possessions and the liberty of all.\n",
       "  1      Gentlemen of the National Assembly, the world in which we live today is an entirely different world from that which we knew only a few years ago. Whereas before the World War, democracy was gaining ground everywhere, mankind is now divided into two great camps—those who believe in democracy and those who feel contempt for it as a completely discredited system of government. By our political education, by our convictions and by our inclinations, we are a democracy. We have established a democratic system of government and the perpetuation of this system will depend upon our ability to convince our people that democracy can be freed from those vices which have destroyed it in some countries, and that it can be made as efficient as any other system of government known to man. It behooves us; therefore, to prove that through a wise use of democratic processes, the welfare and the safety of the people can be promoted, thus contributing our share to the preservation of democracy in the world."
