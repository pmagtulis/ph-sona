#A database of Philippine presidents' State of the Nation Addresses, 1936-2020


##In broad strokes, what is this about?

Just as the subhead says this contains all State of the Nation Addresses of former and current presidents of the Philippines.
The database covers speeches from the administration of Manuel Quezon to Rodrigo Duterte, with the exception of Jose Laurel, which the source did not have.


##What is SONA?

It's basically the counterpart of the US president's State of the Union Address. Under the Philippine Constitution, the president is mandated to deliver 
the SONA every fourth Monday of July to open a new session of Congress. The speech is closely watched by the media for policy directions and agenda.



##What is the source of the data?

-Information in the database were scraped from https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/past-sona-speeches/, which is hosted by the official portal of the
Philippine national government. The website is maintained and updated regularly. Information was scraped using BeautifulSoup and Selenium.

-We used Jupyter Notebook and Python
